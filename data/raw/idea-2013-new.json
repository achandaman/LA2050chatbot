    "summary": "How do you belong? Belonging is the deepest sense of being socially connected and research shows that belonging can lead to Community Well-Being. We are sparking a community movement to belong and much more. Through the collective effort of organizations and people working together, we will change the destiny for all children, families and their neighborhoods, particularly the most vulnerable ones. We are creating a “Belong” model/framework that can be replicated by other diverse neighborhoods in Los Angeles and beyond using their unique assets!",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The pioneering work of Belong with its development of a neighborhood social movement will have significant benefit to Los Angeles. Belong will bring about a holistic community transformation by galvanizing and supporting neighborhood residents to create their own community response to improving their neighborhoods/communities and contributing to safe and supportive environments for their and the neighborhood’s children.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success in 2050 for Social Connectedness would mean that residents will take pride in and have a sense of belonging to the Los Angeles community. Neighbors will know neighbors and can rely on each other for daily support and in times of crisis or need. They will voluntarily work together to not only identify and voice concerns, but they will know how to work together to solve community problems. Through the process of becoming volunteer Community Ambassadors, residents will develop their leadership skills so they know how to engage local businesses, officials and other community members. In building these connections and social bonds, levels of trust among and between these groups will grow. They will gain a deeper understanding of the importance of investing in the early years in order to improve our children’s educational and economic outcomes thereby making Los Angeles a place where residents and businesses will thrive.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Children’s Bureau has engaged 75 public and private partner organizations as well as individual community members who all have a shared vision for the transformation of this community through a collaborative alliance. Each of our diverse partners brings their own area of expertise to help shape the shared holistic outcome of strengthening communities. In particular, we will work closely with Children’s Nature Institute, LIFT-Los Angeles, and UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and communities. Together we will promote the Belong Campaign and work to address four pillars that are key to healthy neighborhoods: health, school readiness, nurturing parenting, and economic stability.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "For over 100 years, Children’s Bureau has been a leader and innovator of child abuse treatment and prevention in Southern California. With a focus on young children, we were one of the first professional providers of foster care in the nation. Children’s Bureau was a vital partner in establishing the Community Chest, a precursor to United Way and played a key role in establishing the USC School of Social Work. In the 1980’s we transitioned from focusing on treatment and moving on to prevention as a key means of keeping children safe from harm. Our successes in the critical battle to prevent child abuse earned us a highly regarded reputation. The California Department of Social Services’ Office of Child Abuse Prevention awarded Children’s Bureau a grant to form the Family Resource Center Technical Training and Support Team which acts as a training model for other organizations. Children’s Bureau continues to be awarded numerous contracts and grants to implement county programs designed to protect vulnerable children and enhance their lives. We are one of a small group of agencies in Los Angeles County nationally accredited by the Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and Children, Inc.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The Magnolia Community Initiative currently measures progress and success through a measurement strategy that captures outcomes at the neighborhood, family and child levels. This is already established and involves capturing data on neighborhood and family conditions on a quarterly, annual and biannual basis. As part of the measurement strategy, the Initiative conducted resident surveys in 2009 and 2011. These Community Belonging Survey results show significant need for improvement in social connectedness and social support. For example, in 2011, 66% of residents had at least one neighbor with whom they could discuss a personal problem, 31% of residents know their neighbors and feel as if they care about the neighborhood; and 24% of residents participate in neighborhood activities. We are capturing data on social connections, ties to neighbors, perceptions of community, community belonging and civic participation."

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "By 2050, we hope that there will be a drastic reduction in the rates of obesity in our communities. We hope the kids in our program have retained a lifelong commitment to exercise, nutrition, civic engagement and volunteerism. Additionally, we hope they have led by example and their kids will also have lifelong commitments to the same. We hope that The Yacht Club will teach them to also be educators - leading the classes they used to be students in, understanding and pushing for the skills that were so pivotal in shaping them into adulthood. Their own children will be helping to shape new programs at LA City Rec and Parks centers which have, once again, become the touchstones of our communities - the place where neighbors meet, kids play, and communities grow together.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Currently our growth and success is built on word of mouth. The Yacht Club started with 10 players and volunteers and has grown to nearly 500, all from players encouraging friends and strangers to get involved. By people continuing to step up through our adult programming and get involved in The Yacht Club, their desire to take the helm and start new projects that benefit their community is one measurement of success.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "To date, The Yacht Club has successfully transformed 500+ dodgeball players into engaged, socially-conscious Angelenos by creating a diverse number of opportunities for participants to volunteer directly in their communities, in addition to adding roughly 1300+ hours of physical activity for kids and adults. This has been achieved through the following programming efforts:",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "We believe a more physically active Los Angeles means a healthier Los Angeles, but exercise is just one of many benefits and advantages The Yacht Club can bring to the neighborhoods that need it most. We also offer a safe and fun place for kids to hang-out by creating positive experiences and engaging activities, helping LA City Rec and Parks centers to become a living and breathing part of the community and a focal point for those living within it. Additionally, the art and educational programs we offer are designed to build vital skills that enhance human development, such as: confidence, critical thinking and an entrepreneurial spirit, which studies show results in more engaged young people that are more likely to avoid the juvenile court system, stay in school, and even go to college."

    "summary": "This year, the Dream Resource Center (DRC), within the UCLA Labor Center, is launching a new high-school educational program in partnership with the Children’s Defense Fund and the Los Angeles Unified School District. Our goal is to develop an immigrant rights curriculum that focuses on contemporary issues facing immigrant youth. The program includes high quality academic enrichment, parent and family involvement, civic engagement and social action, intergenerational leadership development, and nutritional and mental health. The curriculum will integrate the two publications that have captured the voices of immigrant youth throughout the country, Underground Undergrads and Undocumented and Unafraid, along with a book that highlights the history of the Los Angeles labor and immigrant rights leader, Miguel Contreras: Legacy of a Labor Leader. High-school youth will be exposed to contemporary social issues and gain the unique opportunity to connect their classroom learning to community empowerment. The program will involve high-school students from grades 9–12, with the intention of engaging a community of new leaders. Ninth-graders will be able to form an early connection to their new school and peers, while older students will be able to mentor the younger students and impart the knowledge gained from their high school tenure. Coordinators of the outreach program are active members and leaders of the immigrant youth movement and bring with them the experience and knowledge to overcome economic, social, and linguistic barriers to maintaining good grades in high school, excelling in college, and becoming models for the next generation. They will design curriculum for immigrant youth at various high school campuses in the Los Angeles area. The DRC was created to promote access to education for undocumented immigrant youth. As an immigrant-youth-led project, the DRC has played a significant education and research role in two immigrant youth movement victories recently celebrated in the United States: the California Dream Act, a policy that provides financial aid to undocumented college students, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama administrative action directing federal immigration authorities to defer deportation and provide two-year work permits for undocumented youth. These victories were won by undocumented immigrant youth, and the leaders of this movement are in the best position to provide outreach and education to their peers regarding policy changes that affect their access to work permits and higher education. Both of these victories were won by the courage, determination, and perseverance of immigrant youth themselves, without staff, lobbyists, or funding. With these new policies in place, now is the time to educate the next generation of immigrant youth about their educational and employment opportunities. Some Los Angeles inner-city high schools have up to a 30 percent undocumented immigrant student population. Yet to date, there are no ongoing programs within the LA Unified School District to educate these youth, their parents, teachers, and counselors about how to take advantage of DACA and the California Dream Act. The curriculum being developed and piloted this summer will be the first of its kind and would contribute to the development of ongoing education and outreach to encourage undocumented immigrant youth in Los Angeles to pursue their dreams in higher education.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The Dream Resource Center will evaluate our outreach project and measure success in three ways: 1) Participant feedback from high-school youth; 2) Partner response from school staff, city representatives, and local immigrant youth organizations; and 3) Operational assessment.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Los Angeles Unified School District; United We Dream; Dream Team Los Angeles; Children’s Defense Fund.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "In the last several years, the UCLA Labor Center has emerged as a national resource for undocumented immigrant students and immigrant youth leadership development. The Labor Center has conducted research on immigrant youth, actively promoted their civic engagement, taught the first courses in the country on undocumented students, and published two nationally acclaimed books written by and about undocumented students. The first, Underground Undergrads: UCLA Undocumented Immigrant Students Speak Out is currently in its fourth printing and has sold more than ten thousand copies. The second, Undocumented and Unafraid: Tam Tran, Cinthya Felix, and the Immigrant Youth Movement, is being promoted as part of a national book tour during the 2012–2013 academic school year. To drive activities in this area, the Labor Center established the Dream Resource Center, a project to promote equal access to education by developing educational resources, support, and leadership development for immigrant students across the country.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles will benefit from higher rates of high-school graduation and increased civic engagement among youth. The proposed project will thereby advance the UCLA Labor Center’s commitment to promote access to higher education for underrepresented communities. We expect our Dream Resource Center model will provide information, leadership development opportunities, and infrastructure for building support networks among immigrant youth to be replicated on campuses throughout the city. This will increase opportunities for immigrant youth to participate in leadership development programs, promote civic engagement, and encourage greater access to higher education."

    "summary": "cityLAB proposes to build, study, and publicly display a prototype Backyard Home using innovative, simple technologies that will create sustainable, affordable, flexible, livable housing for Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles developed as a city of suburbs, where yards and gardens surround individual homes to create our distinctive neighborhood identity. But LA’s suburban sprawl also created a laundry list of problems, from traffic congestion to unaffordable home prices. cityLAB, a think tank at UCLA, along with Daly Genik Architects, have developed a new concept and construction technology for “Backyard Homes” that will maintain the beauty of the Los Angeles home-in-the-garden pattern, yet has the potential to provide a substantial supply of new housing. The idea is simple: on a house-by-house basis, owners can acquire and customize a Backyard Home. It arrives to the site packed flat, allowing it to squeeze past side yards and tight spaces. Once in the backyard, a foundation is erected, the flat-packed walls expand to become rooms, and a skin is added to the walls. Homeowners can customize a studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom arrangement, much like purchasing a new car with various interior packages to choose from.\n\nIn fact, there are 500,000 single-family home sites in the City of Los Angeles alone. Already a number of those half-million lots have illegal rental units in their garages and backyards. In 2003, the State of California passed the Granny Flat Law, to permit second units on single-family lots, and in 2009, the City Council acted to make backyard housing possible across Los Angeles. Our project recognizes that the illegal units reflect a real need for backyard housing that is safe, legal, affordable, and easy to construct. The recent state and city rulings provide the guideposts to creating safe, legal units; the cityLAB prototype will create a model of affordable, easy-to-construct Backyard Homes. With the laws and the model home, everything is in place for homeowners to build Backyard Homes that will create a much more diverse housing supply and a more livable Los Angeles.",

The beauty of Backyard Homes is that they maintain the character of existing communities, because they are tiny additions that when taken together have immense implications. Unlike the usual bulky, block-busting apartment buildings or condos, Backyard Homes are built incrementally and can be controlled not by the developer, but by the neighborhood.",

    "summary": "``A Passion at Risk,'' will be a 40-minute short film about teachers from throughout Los Angeles County and their opinions about the future of education reform. Since ``A Nation at Risk,'' was released 30 years, schoolteachers in Los Angeles have been working in a constant state of reform. Some who started out in their early 20s and are now approaching retirement have spent their whole careers in a sector in a constant cycle of reinvention. In this film, teachers will tell their stories about which reforms have worked and which reforms have fallen short and why. Los Angeles still has a persistent achievement gap, many failing schools and a dropout crisis. Most reforms that have not succeeded through the years have failed due to ineffective implementation. In looking back, we will find great ideas that worked and not so great ideas that led to ridiculous situations. Teachers consistently say they are left out of the conversations about reform and are just given marching orders from administrators who may be unaware of the challenges they face in their classrooms. ``A Passion at Risk,'' will give Los Angeles teachers a voice and give them the opportunity to share their visions for a more collaborative future. There will be one teacher for each grade from K-12 and they will be chosen from traditional public schools, charter schools, private and parochial schools. We will not find out until the end what ``type'' of school it is where they are teaching. They will range in age from new teachers to teachers will vast experience. There will be teachers who are union activists and others who do not belong to a union at all. The film is titled, ``A Passion at Risk,'' because so many teachers are leaving the profession despite their passion for teaching. Los Angeles is already seeing teachers come together to talk about how they can have a stronger voice in policies that impact their classroom. This film is meant to serve as an inspiration to that movement and to emphasize the importance of involving teachers in the discussion about how to dramatically improve our schools in the next 37 years.",

In addition, the film will inspire teachers to demand a more active role in how reform will be implemented in their classrooms. The project will be successful if education reform organizations embrace its message and host screenings that will start conversations among local teachers. In addition, we will use the website to promote and distribute the film online.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In 2050, education in Los Angeles would be built to serve the needs of its students. Instead of sticking with systems just because that is always the way things have been done, our communities will have freedom and flexibility to create education programs that inspire our students to excellence. We will come up with funding structures that are consistent so that our schools are not left in a constant cycle of crisis. We will provide teachers with higher salaries and provide incentives to keep our best teachers in the classroom.",

Please see examples here:",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The education community in Los Angeles is outrageously fractured. Despite many attempts to improve education in Los Angeles, we still have persistently failing schools throughout the county. Many times we look for a one size fits all solution and instead of empowering teachers, we are imposing strict rules and regulations that may or may not benefit their work with their students. Currently in LAUSD, we are about to implement a new teacher evaluation system that will likely fail to because of opposition from teachers and a lack of a clear plan from administrators. This film will highlight the need for teachers to have a voice in the changes they will be asked to implement in their classrooms."

    "organization": "KCETLink",
    "summary": "Capitalizing on the immediate success of KCET’s recently launched Ballot Brief, Ground Game further engages citizens throughout the City of L.A. by 1) providing open access to easily understandable information relating to Angelenos’ biggest gripes: traffic, pot holes, air quality, etc., including the related voting records of their elected officials; 2) providing additional background information on these topic that will help individuals understand the complexity of the issues; and 3) connecting citizens to nonprofit organizations that are committed to solving the problem, thereby opening doors to volunteerism. The goals of Ground Game are 3-fold: to further engage civic-minded citizens; to provide easy entre for individuals who have not yet engaged in civic activities; and to foster volunteerism that will advance the goals of non-profit organizations and, at the same time, open avenues for participation to individuals. BACKGROUND Beginning with the 2012 election cycle, Ballot Brief brought L.A. voters information that went beyond the headlines, allowing them to dig deeper with explainers, helpful guides, and cheat sheets of City-wide propositions. Coverage went beyond “horse-race” politics to include important information on the issues through regular online stories and segments on KCET’s daily television program SoCal Connected. Most importantly, Ballot Brief brought voters transparency behind proposition campaign financing. By developing unique “whose funding whom” databases, Ballot Brief brought to light data that is theoretically public, but is difficult to understand because of the complicated way it is accessed and presented. From the moment Ballot Brief coverage began, KCET website traffic saw immediate and exponential growth, garnering a total of 2.5 million page views, 900,000 of them on Election Day, leading to a 5,900 percent increase in average daily website traffic. During the months leading up to the election, the majority of Ballot Brief’s proposition coverage – the cheat sheets and funding databases - were ranked on the first page of Google search results. Major media outlets throughout the U.S. referenced Ballot Brief in their own election coverage. PROJECT OVERVIEW Ground Game will expand the potential of Ballot Brief beyond election cycles by working year-round to build civic engagement in the City’s most disengaged precincts. Through a targeted, ground level informational campaign focused on precincts with low voter turn-out and by utilizing bi-lingual grass-roots and guerilla marketing methods, social media marketing, and word of mouth marketing in collaboration with community-based non-profit’s, Ground Game will acknowledge, empower, educate, encourage, and engage individuals in Los Angeles. By connecting with people on a deeply personal level, “What’s your gripe?,” we will plant the seed of engagement. After all, we all have grievances--rich, poor, regardless of cultural differences--we are in this together; we are a community. The Ground Game website will foster empowerment by providing an easy way to express the grievance and will educate people by connecting them, based on their street address, to their elected officials voting records and providing more in depth information on the subject, and lastly, Ground Game will make the connection between personal gripe and civic engagement by revealing volunteer opportunities within community-based groups.",

Examples of these organizations may be: Healthy City, Neighborhood Councils, and Volunteer Los Angeles, among others.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "One of the downward indicators identified by the LA2050 report in the Social Connectedness arena is low voter turnout. Ground Game will address this challenge by honing in on the Los Angeles precincts with the lowest voter turnout and working to build civic engagement in these micro-neighborhoods. Initially we will focus on 6 to 10 of the worst precincts and launch a grass roots marketing campaign as described above, encourage people to express their frustrations, use the Ground Game website to link individuals to their elected officials, provide additional background information on the issue, and connect individuals to volunteer opportunities. By first focusing on a select number of the most disengaged precincts, we will refine our project methodology and build an engagement toolkit that can be replicated in other areas of the City.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Since 1964, KCET has served Los Angeles and an 11-county region of Southern and Central California.

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Quantifiable information will be gathered using Google Analytics to provide statistics relating to Ground Game website activity. We will also monitor Neighborhood Council elections voting turnout to determine if there are increases in engagement. In the long term, we will collect hard data in the 2015 citywide elections by re-evaluating voter turnout in Ground Game precincts.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "We envision a vibrant and engaged Los Angeles population. People from all walks of life have the opportunity to freely and easily express their opinions through a neutral website that connects them to education, solutions, and volunteer activities. We envision a Los Angeles that is characterized by engaged and empowered, like-minded citizens rather than by isolated, silo'd neighborhoods."

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Participants will self-select an item from process-folios to include in an on-camera interview highlighting the important aspects of their journey and a personal evaluation of the program as a whole. CRE Outreach staff will combine these interviews (with the permission of all parties involved) with video of rehearsals as well as the final performance to create a mini-documentary about the program that will include items from the students’ process-folios, photographs, and footage from the program. A copy of the DVD as well as a written final report will be made available to participants, their families, and the schools.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success would include Los Angeles embracing the theater community not only in terms of its inherent entertainment value, but also recognizing that the performing arts have transformative capabilities; the power to change at-risk youth into service oriented caretakers for the elderly and responsible stewards of their physical surroundings. In 2050 Los Angeles will be the epicenter of empowerment for disabled individuals to receive resources, opportunities for self-expression, and meaningful employment. And in partnership with the VA, the Los Angeles performing arts community will help veterans successfully transition from combat into society.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "By working in the greater Los Angeles community, on stage and in schools, using the medium of theatre, CRE Outreach confronts many challenges that at-risk youth and the disabled community face. Our work provides a constructive and creative forum for participants to bring issues to the forefront and let their voice be heard. Our programs actively engage the most under-served individuals to live better lives and empower them to successfully navigate through today’s society."

    "organization": "Generation Green's Contra Costa County Climate Leaders Program",
    "summary": "The mission of Generation Green's Contra Costa County Climate Leaders Program (4CL) is to facilitate education on environmental policy implementation- to encourage local cities to take action to reduce greenhouse gases in Northern California by implementing best practices used by other local governments. The 4CL Program is modeled after other county networks which have proven to build capacity to the region and we see this model as a perfect addition to the environmental groups in LA county, striving to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare their cities for the climate changes we are currently experiencing and the larger impacts that are yet to come. Our organization provides local elected officials and staff professionals with up-to-date information through a monthly newsletter, fact sheets, and a website with references and links to projects and policies from peer cities in our county and the larger Bay Area. We bolster this effort with a quarterly workshop opportunity to gather face-to-face to review, discuss, network and learn about a current topic through several guest speakers and important stakeholders from the area. Unlike other counties in the Bay Area, Contra Costa County governments have been slower than other governments to address the issue of climate change and we see a similar pattern in the majority of LA County cities. Yet, real action and real implementation is well underway! We see this model as the ideal system for getting LA County to move forward to reduce emissions in order to abide by emission reduction policy and prepare the local cities for what lies ahead. By focusing on the reduction emission strategies which save cities money, local governments can reduce their impact with devastating their budgets. Sharing best practices, policies, documents and activities reduces the strain on any one cities already overworked staff and elected officials. Whether it is benchmarking building energy use or focusing on emergency planning through adaptation strategies, cities can help one another with facilitation by a Climate Leaders branch in LA. Generation Green's 4CL Program has formally established a network of over 700 leaders through our Constant Contact newsletter list and another 500 leaders on social media outlets such as Facebook in the Bay Area, specifically in Contra Costa County. Our network continues to grow on a regular basis. The network uses a multimedia communications strategy that ensures that best practices are shared and implemented throughout the local regional county network as climate action plans are continuing to develop. The communication strategy we have selected has a three pronged multi-media approach that provides encouraging reminders and easy access to the tools necessary to implement new policies. These prongs are: o A regional website that acts as a repository for best practices polices with an interactive map and matrix of key issues o A monthly newsletter full of pertinent and useful information including funding, legislative updates and upcoming events o Periodic half-day workshops providing education and networking opportunities for key stakeholders on key climate issues This multi-media approach ensures that best practices at the forefront of day-to-day discussion--and that they are shared, supported, and implemented into policies that reduce Greenhouse gas emissions in Contra Costa County. By supporting the leaders that are already present in LA County, we will not be stepping on the heels of other organizations or creating more work for staff, but we will be bringing together the many individuals and fostering the Climate Leaders that are already taking action!",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The heat-trapping properties of global warming pollutants are undisputed. The fact that human activities generate these global warming pollutants is also undisputed. With more than 15 years of observed and studied scientific data, we now understand the climate system and its relationship to human activities. There is consensus among the IPCC and scientists about the reality of global warming. Although there may be uncertainty about exactly when, where and how the earth’s climate will respond to global warming pollutants, there is no dispute, and observations indicate, that detectable warming changes are already under way.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Directly from our efforts, six Contra Costa cities have completed Climate Action Plans. Four other Cities are currently in the process of developing a Climate Action Plan and eight additional city agreements have been made to accept assistance from local environmental organizations to being the Climate Action Planning Process by focusing on energy-related emission reduction strategies. By viewing the interactive map on our website, http://www.cccclimateleaders.org/green-cities-map.html, you can see the progress of our county. Significant environmental progress is underway but, there is still much to be done.",

    "summary": "One of the best ways to connect people is through storytelling. In September of 2013, we will launch a 24-hour collaborative filmmaking project that connects diverse populations and neighborhoods of Los Angeles. The theme of the project is “local heroes” and each team will discover, document, and share inspiring stories of the community. 15 filmmaking teams will be assembled that consist of three novice filmmakers from underserved communities, three professional filmmakers (mentors), and six to ten volunteers. Each team will be diverse in age, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Moreover, each project will take place in a different neighborhood, with the goal of occupying as many unique areas of Los Angeles as possible. Prior to shooting the film, the team will work with community-based organizations to discover stories of local heroes and to build support for the project. The teams will have a month to develop relationships, but only one day to actually shoot and edit the film. At the end of the 24-hour period, the films will be screened first to the community, then as a complete program at a special event, and finally they’ll live online and will be pushed out via a social networking campaign.

The result of this connection and involvement is that all neighborhoods will have affordable housing, jobs within a 30-minute commute, and access to parks, arts, and culture.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "In the short term, we will measure success by the number of volunteers who participate, the number of films that are completed, how well the teams work together, and how many community members were engaged to complete the projects. In the long term, we’ll look at how many of the participants in the project continued in volunteer service at Outfest or another non-profit organization, how many people got more engaged in their neighborhood or community, how many underserved people became engaged in filmmaking or storytelling as a result of this project, and how many people used the skills they learned in the project to get work.

First, it’s a creative way to promote the concept and use of rain barrels, which would be very beneficial if used by every in the dry, urban area of LA. Second, 30 rain barrels get out there which adds up to more than 1500 gallons of water conservation (and protection) every time it rains. Third, because of the way we designed the auctions, if we can raise sufficient funds then this project becomes sustainable and can go on until the end of time (or at least a good couple years:)",

    "slug": "2013/advancing-justice-through-legal-social-enterprises",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "ADVANCE",
    "summary": "ADVANCE builds a “Teach for America” for legal reform that produces socially responsible lawyers committed to restoring justice and access to legal services. An experiential training program to transform how attorneys practice law in L.A., CA, ADVANCE helps millions gain unprecedented access to legal services and lawyers build satisfying careers committed to justice. We train law graduates to become socially responsible attorneys who: 1) deliver legal services through a social enterprise model; 2) make positive changes to a lawyer’s work-life balance; and 3) restore integrity, trust, and access in the justice system for all. **The Problem** The outdated practice of law is a major cause of social problems. The justice gap between low to moderate income people and legal services is widespread, and grows as courts and legal nonprofits face budget cuts. In L.A., half of its 10 million residents come to court without a lawyer. Meanwhile, new law grads remain unemployed or enter a dissatisfying profession that is reluctant to help advance legal access. Currently, legal self-help, nonprofit, and pro bono services have failed to close the justice gap. Public Counsel, Equal Justice Works, Legal Aid, and justice corps provide direct legal services to the poor but lack sustaining forms of revenue and fail to serve a large percentage of the population. Solo practice incubators train lawyers in traditional forms of law practice that ignore social enterprise values. Others, such as DOJ’s Access to Justice, are vulnerable to budget cuts and struggle to attract probono lawyers. Likewise, traditional firms only promote probono assistance and social responsibility as an aside. **ADVANCE--The Solution** Our model is the first legal training program that equips lawyers to build careers committed to closing the justice gap and approaches the legal practice as a social enterprise. Based on Harvard’s shared value concept, it dismantles the old law firm model and returns lawyers to the business of service and addressing societal needs and challenges. In the end, ADVANCE not only helps to solve the justice gap by providing access to legal services for the majority of Angelenos, it also helps provide jobs for the nearly 50% of unemployed law school graduates who want to help their community but have no means to do so. In addition, by addressing these two issues facing the legal system, ADVANCE will help alleviate the overcrowding and lack of resources facing Los Angeles court systems. **The Idea** A hybrid that places social responsibility at the core of legal services, we create a social enterprise law firm model that trains lawyers to provide affordable and innovative legal services to low and moderate income people. Consisting of a B corp law firm and training program, new law graduates will enter a 2-year, salaried position to learn how to practice law that advances social responsibility, healing and restored justice. The program includes: trainings; workshops; leadership courses; law practice management courses; mentoring and coaching; online resources; and the creation of easy-access legal “minute clinics” at locations convenient to target populations. At the end, trainees will be equipped to offer holistic legal services in restorative justice, collaborative law, conflict resolution, mediation, and civil and criminal law. Trainees will also learn how to start and manage a law firm that reconnects legal business success with social progress. Having access to legal representation should never be limited to the rich. Angelenos with low or moderate incomes, or who are unemployed, equally deserve legal representation. ADVANCE delivers justice for this population that has long been left behind. With ADVANCE, the impossible begins to become possible -- a model for justice provided to all.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We plan to work with private and public nonprofits, such as the CA Bar, American Bar Association, Department of Justice, Pro Bono Institute, Taproot Foundation and Public Interest Law Foundation, to garner support for our idea. In addition, we are collaborating with legal experts, scholars, and entrepreneurs across the U.S. that are committed to solving the problems ADVANCE addresses and that promote innovative legal practices such as integrative law and holistic law. Lastly, ADVANCE is a semi-finalist for the Echoing Green Fellowship, which has provided more than $31 million in start-up funding to leaders in a variety of sectors to implement bold ideas aimed at affecting social change.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "ADVANCE will serve as a vanguard for the legal profession: inspiring, training, and producing cutting-edge, socially responsible lawyers committed to closing the justice gap in Los Angeles. We help deliver affordable legal services to millions of people, and empower law graduates to become social entrepreneurs and practice law centered in restoring justice.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Looking back at our measurables, in 2050, we hope that every woman and man in Los Angeles will have a lawyer, no matter their social or economic backgrounds. Access to justice will no longer be a luxury. 100% of the 5 million people currently going unrepresented in court will have legal representation, provided to them by new law graduates who will be equipped and able to serve their community. The court systems will no longer face overcrowding and case overload issues. And lawyers will return to the role they were meant to serve -- stewards of justice.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "In the first year, we will train 3 new law graduates and serve 500 clients. By year 5, we plan to have 50 socially responsible lawyers graduate from our training program, with 30,000 people served annually.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "ADVANCE is still in its idea stages; however, as mentioned, we have been selected as a semi-finalist for the Echoing Green Fellowship, which would fund our organization for the next two years. In addition, one of the organization's founders has seen how her work as a lawyer and social entrepreneur implementing a law firm model identical to ADVANCE's has made positive and lasting changes to low and moderate income people navigating the justice system in L.A. But her experience has been met with challenges when trying to address the needs of a large population. This led her to see potential in creating a training program so legal professionals like her can help people the law is meant to serve."

    "slug": "2013/preparela-building-resilience-through-community-and-volunteer-engagement",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "American Red Cross Los Angeles Region",
    "summary": "PrepareLA is an innovative campaign designed by the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region to engage individuals and communities in taking preparedness action so that they are better equipped to respond to emergencies and disasters. As part of this effort, the Red Cross is mobilizing volunteers, educating residents, raising public awareness, and leveraging community partnerships to help drive resilience throughout Los Angeles County. For decades, the Red Cross has worked to increase emergency preparedness, but despite our efforts, the number of prepared Angelenos remains acutely small: a County of Los Angeles Public Health survey shows that a mere 6 percent of households reported being “completely prepared” for a disaster. At the same time, the number of large disasters in the United States continues to rise, and with Los Angeles being a densely populated urban area prone to wildfires and earthquakes, the necessity of preparing for a major disaster is more evident than ever. In light of this situation, the Red Cross has devised a new way to increase not only preparedness but also resilience in the communities we serve. PrepareLA tackles preparedness and resilience at the individual, organizational, AND community level. This is important for two reasons: 1) social scientists have shown that one of the ways in which people become more motivated to take preparedness actions is to hear about them from many different angles (in the media, at work, at their place of worship, at school, in the grocery store) and when they see other people taking preparedness actions; and 2) together, a community is able to manage challenges that go beyond what any unaffiliated group of individuals can accomplish. The PrepareLA campaign was created on the principle that resilience is driven in large part on the relationships and trust that are built among the various sectors of a community. While PrepareLA includes goals to build capacity in the areas of mass care, human resources, and communications, it places much of its focus on increasing community engagement. It is our goal that each of Los Angeles County’s 272 communities will be prepared for a large-scale disaster. This includes trained volunteers, individuals who are educated on life-saving skills such as CPR and first aid, and emergency plans that have been designed by community members based on their own risk and resource assessments. In order to achieve this, we have created innovative preparedness strategies: The COMMUNITY AMBASSADOR PROGRAM recruits community leaders to serve as liaisons with the Red Cross and promote preparedness in their neighborhoods. These community-centric volunteers, who reside and work in the area, help bridge the gap between community needs and Red Cross services. Our three-year goal is to have each of the 272 Los Angeles communities represented by an Ambassador who will help create awareness and movement toward community preparedness. Community Ambassadors receive training and are provided with materials to assist in their role, including a Community Scorecard. This scorecard is used to track the success of the Ambassadors’ efforts in their communities toward three of our core PrepareLA goals: (1) increasing community engagement through preparedness education and outreach, (2) volunteer recruitment, and (3) strengthening feeding and sheltering capacity. Community Ambassadors meet quarterly as a group to discuss strategies, recent accomplishments and challenges, and how they can work together to leverage and share community resources. The FAITH-BASED PROGRAM aims to connect the Red Cross with faith organizations to introduce PrepareLA and promote services that foster community resilience. We are inviting all faith organizations in the region to become official Red Cross Affiliates that will serve the community through outreach, preparedness, volunteering, and sheltering & feeding partnerships. These collaborations are critical as we know that in the event of a disaster many people naturally turn to the faith community. As part of the campaign, we have hired a Faith-Based Coordinator to serve as the link between the Red Cross and the faith community and develop new relationships and strengthen existing ones. PrepareLA will directly impact Social Connectedness in Los Angeles by providing a platform where residents can come together to volunteer and make a difference in the life of their communities. By encouraging everyone to take preparedness action both at the individual and community levels, PrepareLA inspires us to interact with our neighbors and be active participants of society. The importance of this initiative has already caught the attention of several other Red Cross regions in Southern California and prompted them to join our efforts, and PrepareLA is now part of a larger PrepareSoCal campaign.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In an ideal future, the Los Angeles of 2050 would be a region where everyone dedicates time to participate in and better their communities. Neighbors would know each other and be connected to local organizations and community groups. And volunteering wouldn’t be a second thought, something that only a few idealists and seniors do. Children would learn the value of humanitarianism and civic engagement early on, and high school and college students would take advantage of volunteer opportunities not only to build their resume but also to make a difference in the lives of others. This experience would in turn give young people “a sense of purpose and a reason to remain in school and strive to learn,” as research by the Children’s Defense Fund already demonstrates. And all adults and retirees would volunteer their time to teach preparedness education and respond to emergencies in the region.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "While responsibility for the overall PrepareLA strategy and implementation lies within the Red Cross, we will only be able to achieve our goals with support from and continuous collaboration with local community groups and other organizations. Examples include our partnerships with Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Map Your Neighborhood, and the Community Police Advisory Board, among many others.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "In recent years, we have seen an increase in major disasters across the globe—Hurricane Katrina, earthquakes in Chile and Haiti, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and most recently Superstorm Sandy. However, while the number of disasters has increased steadily from the 1970s to today, the reported loss of life has been decreasing, demonstrating that early warnings, preparedness, and planning can save lives.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Here in the Los Angeles region, the Red Cross responds on average to one emergency every day, ranging from single-home fires to wildfires affecting hundreds of families. This past fiscal year alone, we responded to 328 emergencies and assisted 457 families, opening 10 shelters and activating feeding canteens more than 15 times. This is only possible through our dedicated staff and volunteers taking the required training, being on-call, and working as a team to support the communities we serve. It is this preparation that allows us not only to respond to emergencies here but also support national operations such as Superstorm Sandy. To date, we have deployed four Emergency Response Vehicles and more than 160 staff and volunteers from Los Angeles to the East Coast. In addition to supporting relief operations, deployment also helps our local volunteers to get the hands-on experience they will need when a large disaster occurs here at home."

Even more remarkable, Los Angeles bears the burden of disparity based on ethnicity, socio-economic class and geography within the Los Angeles landscape.

If violence is left unchallenged and unchecked in the microcosm of the dating scene and the family home, then it will mushroom into larger conflicts. Without intervention, individuals caught in the cycle of abuse may be at risk for death, disability, injury, and involvement with the criminal justice system.

As active members of their local communities, within schools, on the streets, at jobs, etc, they will bear the creative ability to not only be productive, but also transformative. As more young people, especially in isolated communities due to geography, ethnicity, or socio-economic classs, find the ability to navigate the complex system of institutional, civic and professional networks, the stratified nature of the Los Angele ecosystem becomes more flattened and a sustainable and healthy city.

Questions address the participants’ understanding of healthy relationships, interpersonal communication skills, and the impact of choices on likely outcomes. The survey results are analyzed using a statistical program, and paired t-tests are used to assess statistical significance between pre- and post-test responses (set at .05). A feedback form is completed after each workshop. These indicate, from the participants’ perspective, their retrospective view on new concepts and skills that were acquired in each session. It is expected that a minimum of 75% of the participants will indicate they learned something new."

    "summary": "Low income communities of color are disproportionately impacted by cumulative sources of pollution and poor land use decisions. The only way these disparities can be seriously addressed is for well-informed community members to engage in the decision-making process. Our idea is to build a generation of civic leaders that will work with different stakeholders to transform their communities and their neighborhoods toward more sustainable and livable environments. In this project we propose to offer a wide range of leadership development and technical trainings related to civic engagement and environmental stewardship. These trainings will build the capacity of a dedicated group of youth activists, leaders and future decision-makers in Southeast Los Angeles County and in the Harbor area--which is host to some of the most polluted and vulnerable communities in the Los Angeles region. Here are the activities that CBE proposes: Leadership Development Trainings: Youth will complete an intensive 6-week, 18-hour summer training. Youth will learn how and why pollution disproportionately affects low-income communities of color (Session I); the locations of the most egregious polluting industries in their communities (Session 2); pollution’s detrimental effects on human health in their communities (Session 3); the environmental decision-making processes in their communities (Session 4); how community efforts can successfully stop or prevent pollution (Session 5); and how communities develop a vision for protecting and improving their environments (Session 6). Educational and team-building elements of the trainings will help youth build motivation to become leaders in community environmental stewardship. Mono Lake Trainings: Youth and adults will participate in intergenerational “Parent Night” workshops on water issues and Mono Lake. Youth, with CBE staff, will participate in 5-day, 4-night educational field trips and trainings at Mono Lake, hosted by the Mono Lake Committee. Youth will learn to analyze the relationship between Mono Lake and the Southern California water supply, how to gather and test water samples to assess the health of water, and uses for this data. By learning about water conservation practices and about the impact of Southern California water use on Mono Lake, they will develop motivation to conserve water on individual and household levels, for example by turning off the tap while showering or brushing teeth and by using water-efficient systems to water plants. LA River Stewardship Training: Youth will each attend 1.5-hour LA River Stewardship workshops and one of three, 2.5-hour LA River Stewardship kayaking field trips with CBE and LA River Expeditions staff. During the workshops, youth will learn about water pollution issues related to the LA River, the history of the revitalization of the upper portion of the river, and current community efforts to revitalize the lower portion. Youth will learn to analyze the relationships between mobile sources of pollution and river water quality, and between the future health of the lower portion of the river and planning for Highway I-710, which runs next to it. During the post-field trip workshop, all youth will gather to compare the upper and lower LA River, to analyze the impact of river pollution on human health, to problem-solve better solutions, and to conduct a visioning process for river stewardship. Stormwater Pollution Trainings: Youth will participate in one 1.5-hour stormwater pollution workshops and water sampling field trips with CBE and LA Waterkeeper staff. The workshops, co-led by CBE staff and LA Waterkeeper, will teach youth to think critically about industrial water pollution and how the Clean Water Act can be used to reduce it. During the field trips, youth will see and learn how industrial runoff contaminates ecological systems and affects the health of humans and other species and will gather water samples to be evaluated for pollution levels.",

Clean water, clean air, safe streets for walking and biking, an improved public transportation system, revitalized brownfields, more open/green space, more access to healthy food outlets and nutrition, more engaged communities, and more accountable decision-makers will be the indicators that will demonstrate significant improvements in the current disparities in environmental justice communities.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Environmental justice communities are at the fence-line of polluting sources. Creating greener and cleaner operations at the fence-line neighborhoods and improving land-use decisions in vulnerable communities will not only promote the public health of residents most in need but also benefit the entire LA region. Addressing environmental equity for communities that have traditionally been neglected due to gaps in proper permitting, enforcement and planning will create great environmental benefits to the most susceptible LA communities by way of improved air quality, reduction of water pollution, enhanced access to open space, revitalization of blighted lands, greater access to healthy food options, greater community cohesion and overall improvement of quality of life.",

    "summary": "The Northeast San Fernando Valley has been going through a transformative process of Arts and Culture in the past couple of years, there have been a dozen new murals added to Pacoima’s’ walls. This has been possible due to the hard work and dedication of community muralists from the Northeast San Fernando Valley. A Summer Arts Festival at Project Youth Green would expose youth and organizations to the importance of arts and culture for community revitalization. Art centered youth programs in the area do not have the capacity to serve the large Latino youth demographic. Project Youth Green, a four acre community garden has been expanding since it first opened and has been home to a practice ground for local artists and youth groups in the community. Artists of all backgrounds and experience levels have participated in painting a canvased gate, adding a wide range of styles, techniques and visuals to the landscape. Currently, this wall is falling apart, the material it is painted on is not meant for painting, and after more than 20 layers of murals in the past 4 years this piece of tarp is deteriorating. One idea is to re-canvas this wall with a more sustainable material, as well as add more canvas to existing walls. Then with an art competition, invite youth to participate in covering the empty space with new art. Each youth group would be mentored by a practicing artist from the Northeast San Fernando Valley. In order to assure that the next generation has the skills required to continue and expand on this art revitalization, we must expose and train young people to master the brush. Another aspect to art and design would be to challenge local youth art groups to design four sculptures. These sculptures would be strategically placed considering the land’s terrain in order to create a water harvesting system that would help the garden become self-sustaining. With the added blank canvas at the community garden youth are given the opportunity to learn and practice mural skills by providing a space where they can work on large-scale projects. A group of artists who are part of this movement will hold workshops, sharing their skills with youth at centers, schools, and organizations. The skills of design, collaboration, and sustainability can be taught simultaneously through art and gardening. A contest would then be held, opening it up to the youth in the community, where a select number will be chosen to compete at a summer arts festival. Each artist will have a mentor to guide them through the contest. There will be criteria to follow that will challenge their creative thinking and design skills. A winner will be chosen by a panel of judges and the winner will be given the opportunity to add their own mural to Pacoima’s Mural Mile. All other contestants will be given prizes and the opportunity to help the winner design and execute their mural.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In 2050 success will be a continuing art movement, not just in the Northeast Valley, but expanded into the entire Los Angeles area. Art is proven to have positive impacts on communities, and in an area where crime rate is high, graduation rate is low, and the access to arts & culture programs are lacking, a successful outcome can include economic growth by attracting sustainable business into the area, increased graduation rates, and creating pride of ownership in the community.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Mural Mile has become a necessary project for artists, community members, and art enthusiasts. There have been a dozen new murals added to Van Nuys Blvd. in Pacoima, all in the past 2 years. This has been a grassroots effort, propelled forward by a core group of public artists who collaborate with local non-profits, but who can also lead a self-funded project with the community. The Pacoima Art Movement has restored pride in the community.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Evaluating the project would require identifying the number of free arts workshops available in the Northeast valley in comparison to other parts of Los Angeles. Also, keeping track of the number of youth involved in arts programs at the beginning the year, in comparison to the end of the year. Furthermore, keeping track of how many organizations would be interested in starting a program at their facilities by the end of the year. The number of artist jobs available versus the number of jobs it will create.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The Northeast San Fernando Valley Art Revitalization Movement will benefit Los Angeles by establishing artistic, cultural and sustainable art projects in a historically neglected part of Los Angeles. The North East San Fernando Valley has the second largest concentration of Latinos in Los Angeles, rivaling East Los Angeles. The community is economically, culturally and racially diverse. Furthermore, the majority of the residents are working class, first-generation Mexican-American or recent immigrants."

For the LA 2050 Challenge, Pacoima Beautiful would like to reinvigorate the 1.6 mile stretch of Van Nuys Blvd. between Laurel Canyon Blvd. and Glenoaks Blvd. There are over 60 small businesses on that portion of Van Nuys Blvd. These businesses range from independently owned and operated grocery stores, restaurants, mechanic shops, cell phone stores, flower shops, and many others. Many of these businesses are surviving on a month-to-month basis. They cover their payroll, and operating costs (rent, and utilities) without being able to invest in business improvements, much less streetscape improvements. If granted $100,000 Pacoima Beautiful would like to reward business owners in a manner that promotes environmental stewardship and saves them money. The funds from the LA 2050 Challenge would allow us to award 40 businesses, each with $1,000 in goods and services paid by Pacoima Beautiful to make environmentally friendly improvements to their business. The remaining funds would be used to make streetscape improvements to the 1.6 mile stretch of Van Nuys Blvd. and cover program costs. Making these green improvements will begin a shift in the way our business community thinks about environmental responsibility. Examples of eligible improvements are (but not limited to): Implementing the use of recycling bins, zero to low Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) paint, energy efficient lighting, energy efficient windows, drought tolerant/native landscaping, green roofs, air conditioning system improvements, etc. Eligibility for the $1,000 (in goods and services) would be determined through an application process. Working in conjunction with groups such as the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce and the Valley Economic Development Center we would look into 1) Which environmental impact would the applicants improvement minimize? 2) How long has the business been in operation? 3) How will the business owner(s) maintain/sustain the improvement? We will also evaluate our award recipient’s awareness of environmental hazards and green business practices starting at the application process. This initial evaluation will be used as a baseline to gauge need for improvements and knowledge of environmentally safe practices. Awards would be given out from September 2013 through October 2013. Streetscape improvements would be completed no later than the end of April of 2014. In regards to the Environmental Quality indicator, our efforts would result in improved environmental quality due to creating a business culture that is less harmful to the environment, and more welcoming due to improved streetscapes. We also look forward to providing an increased sense of support for our business community and increased civic pride. In our community our people are our strength. Within our business community, business owners are very dedicated to creating jobs, and serving the needs of their customers. At Pacoima Beautiful we would like to include businesses into our culture of environmental justice and provide them with education and support to pass on to their employees and customers. At Pacoima Beautiful we create awareness in our community through engagement in our various free programs. To sustain the enthusiasm for maintaining improved streetscapes and business practices we welcome all members of the business community to learn how city planning and civic engagement can benefit them through our 12-week People’s Planning School. The curriculum focuses on city planning, public participation, environmental stewardship, advocacy, and leadership development which will help us achieve our vision of a better L.A. in 2050.",

The indirect ways in which Los Angeles benefits from the proposed project is by creating a collaborative culture between environmental justice and business. Often, environmental justice organizations are thought of as wanting to keep business and industry out of their area. Pacoima Beautiful knows that in order for our community to thrive, we need to welcome business and take their investment in our community as an opportunity for collaboration.

Residents learned to identify environmental hazards and access resources to address those hazards, how to increase awareness of environmental health issues and become advocates for change. From 2006 through the present, our Community and Environmental Planning work has focused on community wide environmental issues and to date program staff has engaged hundreds of residents in workshops and presentations in order to identify and prioritize environmental concerns. Most recently this has included advocacy to reduce the impacts of diesel pollution and to promote policies to transform Environmental Justice communities, such as our landmark Clean Up, Green Up campaign working with organizations throughout the city to reduce, mitigate, and revitalize communities like Pacoima."

    "summary": "Slake: Los Angeles is the first journal of narrative nonfiction, fiction, essay, memoir, photography and poetry in Los Angeles to gain worldwide recognition for its quality and design. Slake is devoted to the art of narrative storytelling in a media landscape where that mission is increasingly difficult and rare, but ever more essential. Storytelling breeds empathy and understanding, which improve community engagement and increase our civic stake. Slake will continue to give voice to the intellectual and creative resources of Los Angeles and shows them to the world at a time when Los Angeles is becoming the most important city in America as we move further into the 21st Century. Slake's highly attended readings, events, and Slake After Dark author and musician series will continue rally the literary and arts community to Los Angeles' civic mission. Most importantly, Slake will expand it's mission to include a publishing imprint that will bring the projects of underserved LA writers and artists to the world. There is no reason Los Angeles should rely on the permission of New York to get its creative capital disseminated.",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles, the gateway to Latin America and the Pacific Rim is criminally disadvantaged when it comes to disseminating and distributing the work of its artists, writers and intellectuals. This is primarily the means of production (and locus of prejudice towards Los Angeles) in publishing remain in New York. In it's brief history, Slake: Los Angeles, A City and its Stories, has competed with the best journalis in the world and won. Slake has been honored by press clubs, Pen Center, Livingston Awards, Franco American Foundation, and the prestigious Best Of American series five times (in two eligible issues). This is a remarkable feat and it's been accomplished because nobody know and can harness LA's talent better than Slake and its editors, Joe Donnelly and Laurie Ochoa.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Our partners will be the universities (USC and Occidental) where we have established relationships as well as such cultural programs as The Hammer, where we've done successful events, and venues such as The Bootleg Theater and many other programming venues throughout the city and Pasadena at which Slake has provided rich, exciting events as well as venues such as Track 16 and Atwater Crossing to which Slake has brought hundreds to thousands of Angelenos for evenings of art, literature and music. We also collaborate with bookstores throughout the region, where our readings are often among the best attended. Slake has done highly successful programming for social and political events such as All in For the 99 and will continue to do so.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Slake will measure success by increasing subscriptions, sales, event attendance and national and international recognitions, such as Cindy Carcamo's piece from Slake #2, \"Return To Sender\" winning international awards for immigration reporting and stories by Richard Lange, Joe Donnelly, Harry Shannon, Erica Wrightson, Joseph Mattson and others who have been recognized by The Best American series. Mostly, though, we'll measure our success by sustaining and growing Los Angeles' literary and artistic",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Most importantly, Slake proved Los Angeles can produce a beautiful, exciting, smart journal of arts and letters that bridges the gap between stagnant old-world iterations of such and the future of long-form publishing. Slake is as intelligent as it as it is lovely and its success belies the myth that people don't have time or don't want to engage with more in-depth narrative. We've raised expectations for both Los Angeles and for the world as to what we should expect from a Los Angeles journal. Meanwhile, we've provided much needed gravity around which this often diffused community.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Los Angeles, the premiere city of the 21st Century would own its own means of production for producing and publishing for broad consumption its intellectual, artistic and academic capital."

    "summary": "\"Fear is very real in the lives of children from hard places. In fact, fear often ‘bullies’ our children into much of their misbehavior. As a result, it is critical that parents of children from hard places approach fear and fear-driven behaviors with compassion, insight and wisdom.\" - Dr. Karyn Purvis http://empoweredtoconnect.org/the-impact-of-fear/ Youth do not feel safe anymore in the streets or anywhere outside of their community. Often times they do not feel safe in their community. One of the key issues is the distrust between youth and law enforcement. The contacts between the two entities are often negative or for enforcement purposes only leaving our youth feeling disfranchised not just by gangs, bullies, or antagonists, but by the very system designed to protect them. Oftentimes, this negative interaction stays with youth and they lose faith in law enforcement. Whether the reasoning is correct or not, a greater trust must be forged by youth and public safety and that includes increased education for both entities. Youth must be empowered, educated, and entertained as they seek to learn about law enforcement and the role it can and should play in their lives. Furthermore, a bridge must be established with law enforcement where they embrace the youth of Los Angeles as a resource. Our program will seek to educate the youth through education and the use of interactive software designed empower youth on their rights, as well promote discourse with law enforcement agencies. This program will encourage youth to become involved in youth advisory councils that are in place in their communities and help in the design of a community youth program that LA CAUSA is designing to encourage peer leadership to reduce crime, increase accountability, increase communication between the public and law enforcement entities including parents, peers, community, police, sheriffs, city and district attorneys, and the courts. The program will teach youth the law and increase their understanding of its role in their lives, how to react to law enforcement contacts, the criminal justice system process so that the youth understands how it can help them, and finally to become vocal members of the community to increase community participation in a restorative justice program that LA CAUSA YouthBuild is creating. It has been proven through many different studies that a restorative justice model will work in any community it is instituted. http://www.why-me.org/victims/victims-and-restorative-justice-statistics/ This program sets the foundation of young leaders as being active not passive participants in this program and allows them to work with leadership at all levels of promotion and become the stakeholders themselves in this process. The outcomes should lead to lower recidivism rates for all violators who participate in a rj program, but in this cycle show lower negative contacts with law enforcement for all serviced youth and increased participation in the development of a rj program. This would have the youth as stakeholders go to these entities and serve as co-sponsors of program development and implementation. The outcome is reduced crime, increased trust between our youth and law enforcement, and increased youth participation in crime reduction strategies.",

LA CAUSA seeks to have it's young leaders become stewards of change in a community that has been voiceless. In a community with many immigrants, fear of the system has led to victimization and our young people can be the generation that starts the cycle of change from protesting to advocating for improved relationships. Youth will not be so easily incarcerated. Intervention and prevention models will be used and effective in the lives of youth reducing recidivism. Officers will have more of the community identified as advocates and voices of their patrol that they can rely on for support and dialogue. It is not always to agree, but rather to dialogue in a trusting manner so that consensus and understanding can be maintained. Only in this way will the community truly be the eyes and ears of law enforcement to reduce crime, promote safety, and reduce fear.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles is a big city. It is a safe city. But, our city doesn't feel safe to any of our youth and many adults. This misperception could arguably create more unhappiness than we really need. The fear of regions that have been infamously labeled such as \"South Central\", and \"East LA\" characterize the perception of fear people have for areas they have never really visited or experienced. Furthermore, controversies such as the Rodney King Beating and human rights violation charges in the Sheriff's department only further the perception that Los Angeles is a dangerous uninhabitable city. When in reality much has changed while the perception of these agencies has not. The research project by SORIN MATEI, SANDRA J.

It's asset based thinking model has been adopted nationally by YouthBuild USA and many other programs.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Success on this project will be measured on a pre and post survey basis. It will deal with officer knowledge base and youth knowledge base. Furthermore, a follow-up will be attempted with our youth alumni who receive this service to see the impact of the trainings will have on their meetings. The restorative justice program will be a much longer term program which will be an evidence based project with a longer timeline. The initial conception and stakeholder development will occur in this program. The goal of this program will be to measure the fear level and distrust which will also be done via surveys ,ensuring activeness and openness to dealing with law enforcement and different location in Los Angeles.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "This program will initially seek to involve the youth of LA CAUSA, Strategies for Youth (strategiesforyouth.org), the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, LA Probation, and courts to run these classes. We will then outreach to other YouthBuild programs, and local entities with youth programs. It will be an all inclusive program. They will participate in trainings, and meetings, eventually becoming stakeholders in the development of the restorative justice program that LA CAUSA is working on."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Garden School Foundation",
    "summary": "The Garden School Foundation (GSF) has a vision of a Los Angeles community where every child grows, cooks, and eats fresh local produce every day of their lives - in school! Angelinos should capitalize on our most famous characteristic - fabulous weather - to cultivate a city and county with green space and a bountiful harvest accessible to everyone. In partnership with the Farm to Preschool program at the Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College, which focuses on the early childhood years, we propose the following multi-pronged idea to get us there: 1) Build the capacity of entire school communities to support the growth of healthy children through County-wide trainings for teachers, parents, and community volunteers to build the skills necessary to maximize the potential of gardens, thus transforming eating habits for a lifetime. 2) Create the first LA School Garden Network Resource website. While innovative school garden programs exist in the LA region, our urban sprawl tends to isolate programs and schools. We propose to gather, share and leverage our resources to create a force of sustainable change in the region. 3) Host a county-wide school garden forum and resource fair to gather teachers and garden advocates to celebrate the wonderful work happening while inspiring and supporting others to transform their own schools to include outdoor learning environments. By working with and learning from each other we can cultivate a community that will nourish and support the growth of the whole child. Currently, children in LA, particularly those from low income and historically underserved communities of color, suffer from poor health due in part to the debilitating effects of obesity, often stemming from an unbalanced diet lacking fresh fruits and vegetables. Obesity rates in preschool-aged children enrolled in WIC (Women, Infants and Children) in LA are over 22% among Latino children and over 15% of Black children. The link between obesity and low access to healthy food in “food deserts,” among other indicators, is well proven. Furthermore, we know that if children are eating more fresh fruits and veggies they have a lower risk of developing obesity and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, with health effects that could stay with them their entire lives. The good news is that recent studies have shown that if children grow their own food, they are more likely to eat it, a fact that many teachers and parents can testify to firsthand. Given LA’s ideal conditions for growing food and a plethora of unused school land, we can ensure that every child has the opportunity of the benefits of growing fresh food as an integral part of their Prek-5th grade education. This would transform the school and preschool landscape from asphalt to apples -and the hundreds of other fruits and vegetables kids can grow! We propose to cultivate the conditions that will enable every child in LA to grow up having the knowledge, support, and resources at their fingertips to become healthy, connected, and activated adults. This will create a continuum and community of learning from the preschool years through elementary school, using schools as the most obvious setting for change. Our idea builds on the important work that’s already being done and sets the stage for transformative change on a county-wide scale through capacity-building, networking and resource sharing. 1. Capacity-building Preschool and elementary school teachers will be trained on age-appropriate core standards-based nutrition, garden curricula from GSF (Seed to Table) or UEPI (Farm to Preschool’s Harvest of the Month), and basic gardening skills. These curricula effectively link core learning standards such as math, literacy and science to gardens and local healthy food in a school-based setting. In addition, parent workshops will focus on home gardening, affordable healthy foods, empowering parents to find their voice and advocate for healthier food at schools. Community volunteers will be trained in school garden curricula, garden management best practices, and be connected to existing resources. 2. Los Angeles School Garden Network website This website will be designed to focus on school garden resources in the LA region, as well as providing up to date information on events and giveaways, and an online forum for parents, teachers and volunteers to communicate and share best practices, challenges, resources, and advice. 3. School Garden Forum A school garden forum will culminate the school year to bring together all preschool-grade 5 schools with gardens as well as those inspired to start their own programs. This forum will host speakers, discussion roundtables, showcase gardens, programs and resources, provide skill building cooking demos and provide the type of interaction and capacity-building movement in Los Angeles that is sorely lacking",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The Garden School Foundation was founded in 2005 with the mission to create a model of garden-based education for Los Angeles schools that would advance health outcomes and experiential learning opportunities for elementary students. Eight years later, we’ve created the most comprehensive program in the city, with students at our pilot site visiting the ¾ acre kitchen garden every other week during the school day for classes in everything from Science and Language Arts to Cooking and Nutrition. Our Seed to Table curriculum, to be published this June in partnership with the verynice.co design company, is the first of its kind to create a simple, concise, standards-based framework for integrating gardens into elementary schools, and stands to transform garden-based education in Southern California for many years to come.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "It’s a well examined and researched fact that the overall health of children in Los Angeles is poor, with children as young as age 3 suffering from pre-diabetic symptoms. While childhood obesity rates have leveled off in Los Angeles, they continue to be high, with Latino and African American children experiencing disproportionate effects of obesity and related health impacts, due to many factors such as income, housing and food insecurity as well as low access to healthy food with high exposure to calorie and chemical laden junk food. Children in L.A. and around the country are currently so unhealthy that their life expectancy is projected to be lower than that of their parents.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Both GSF and UEPI have extensively evaluated their programs and have validated survey tools applicable to this proposed project. To evaluate preschool-grade 5 teacher trainings (for in-class curriculum and on-site gardening as a teaching tool and for school consumption), teachers will be given surveys at the end of the training to measure effectiveness and perceived increased capacity to offer and sustain this garden-based program at their school. Success will be measured by the number of teachers in the training who feel confident they can implement the program at their site. Surveys (before and at the end of the program, ‘pre’ and ‘post’ tests) will be given to a subset of preschoolers (at least 100 children) and elementary students to evaluate any increases in knowledge of fruits and vegetables, how food is grown, and measures any changes in food preferences. Success will be measured by changes in knowledge and preferences as compared to schools who have not received the program, using data collected from a similar population during Farm to Preschool’s pilot program phase in 2011. Increase in healthy food consumption will be measured from surveys given to teachers during the school year, as well as from taste test sheets that record how many children have eaten the produce (such as from the garden) and how many liked it. Success will be measured by the increased number of children who try the produce as well as like it, over the course of the school year.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College is an academic center conducting research and policy work with the aid of strong community-based partnerships. UEPI has been a strong leader in establishing fresh food programs at both the preschool and public school levels for over 14 years, including for low income preschool and after school facilities. UEPI is also a leader in the emerging national Farm to Preschool movement, creating a network of Farm to Preschool stakeholders across the country. The Farm to Preschool program brings local, affordable food to underserved preschoolers, their families and the wider community as well as creating a learning environment through class-based lessons and school gardens.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Los Angeles in 2050 has transformed its communities, harvesting its “lowest-hanging fruit” to make the best use of its most neglected yet abundant resources. In 2050 we see all children eating healthy foods because they’ve learned how to grow them, and they and their families know that there’s no better place on earth for kids to grow food and learn outside every day of the year than right here in L.A. We’ve capitalized upon the fact that LAUSD land is public land and therefore it is and should be open and trusted to the public to gather, garden, learn, play, and collaborate whenever school is not in session. We’ve created and sustained healthy communities throughout the county, because we’ve learned - and experienced - that in order to grow healthy kids, you have to cultivate their entire community to create a landscape where the HEALTHY choice is the EASY choice."

    "summary": "​M.U.S.E.K will be used as a curriculum for our students.M.U.S.E.K, which stands for Motivating Underprivileged Students thru Empowerment and Knowledge is a program designed to support students, to help them go to college, particularly those from high needs population, to reach their fullest potential. It also serves to level the playing field for minority and low-income students, as well as students who may be the first in their families to potentially attend college. TheM.U.S.E.K program serves to support its students by teaching and reinforcing study and organizational skills, encouraging students to take more rigorous and challenging classes, providing college and career counseling; and ultimately preparing them for success at four-year colleges. M.U.S.E.K isnot a remedial education program; instead it is a college preparatory program designed to provide whatever support may be lacking for students who possess academic potential, but who may not be aware of the power that education holds. NEED STATEMENT In today’s society it is becoming increasingly important for people to successfully complete higher education to be successful in their careers. However, not all students are being provided the same opportunities in regards to their college preparation. Research has shown this, as McClafferty, Torres, and Mitchell (2000) state: “Urban schools tend to be larger, with fewer resources, and located in areas of higher poverty rates. The student populations in urban schools are also more likely to be comprised of people of color or of students who have difficulty speaking English. In addition, children in urban areas are more often exposed to conditions that endanger their health and well-being, such as limited access to medical care and increased exposure to violence and crime” (p.3). Therefore, it is more difficult for teachers in urban schools to prepare their students for college level courses and the rigor that they entail. Furthermore, when students in urban areas are not provided with the resources they need, they often do not meet the A to G requirements, the courses a student needs to have taken to apply for Universities. To take it a step further students sadly aren’t even thinking about college because they are unaware of its accessibility to them. This failure by teachers and staff to deliver this information to students coupled with a lack of resources is a major problem that students at urban schools face. As most of the students come from home environments that do not value education, many students are not enthusiastic about attending school, and often do not see value in doing school work. So, it is important for teachers to reach out and understand their students and the community which they come from. To do this teachers need to find out all the information they can about students backgrounds as well as getting involved in their lives outside of school and getting parents involved. If students are in a cohesive and safe educational environment which provides them with resources and knowledge of opportunities, students will be more likely to take them and hopefully feel more confident in themselves. Confidence will allow them to take risks and strive for higher goals, like going to college. The mission of this program is to address the unique needs of the educationally disadvantaged. We whole heartedly believe that every youth, if provided an opportunity at home and school, has the potential tosucceed. These opportunities include access to a quality education, counseling services to youth and the parents about higher education. MUSEK will serve those students’ grades 9 through 12 who come from one or more of the following high risks groups: Expelled or suspended from home district, Wards of the court or dependents of the court, Pregnant and/or parenting, Recovered Dropouts, Habitually truant or habitually insubordinate and disorderly whose attendance at the school is directed by a school attendance review board or probation officer, Retained more than once in kindergarten through grade eight.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Evaluation of the M.U.S.E.K. program will occur through multiple methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of psycho-social education component a pre and post test will be administered to each participant before and after the program. This evaluative tool will measure learned content from topics discussed from objective 1. In addition to the pre and post test a journal writing prompt will be administer at the last session for participants to reflect about the process of their individual journey. The second method of evaluation will be for objective 2. Students will be given pre and post SAT diagnostic test to chart and assess progress throughout the duration of the program. The final method of evaluation will be for objective 3. Students will be given a pre and post survey assessing their specific interests in music. This will pose as a segue activity that assists students in developing initial ideas for their project. Students will be given pre and post assessments on their knowledge of fundamental music theory, music history and music production. Students will also be given an assessment every Friday to track their progress weekly.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The main goal of the program is to prepare students for a post-secondary degree and ensure that they enroll and graduate from a higher institution of learning. This goal will be accomplished through intense academic preparation and promotion of empowerment. A supplemental goal of the program is to engage students in a project based learning environment centered on learning communities. Forming learning communities will help students develop interpersonal communication skills. It will afford students the ability to lead as well as work cooperatively in a productive manner with their peers. Project base learning breeds empowerment through ownership. Students are more likely to be engaged when their objectives are organic. The responsibility to ascertain knowledge is transferred from teacher to student placing the teacher in the role of mediator. This act in and of its self whether or notrecognized by the host is psychologically empowering.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The program is fairly new and underfunded. However, all students who have been enrolled in the program for the 2012-2013 cycle- have been accepted to a 4 year university. These students come from diverse backgrounds. Some students were significantly performing academically below grade level, but were able to thrive while in the program. All of the students are first-generation college students, so to watch the students overcome personal obstacles to accomplish academic goals is rewarding.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The methodologies of this program will be adopted county wide. This will create a sense of familiarity within the curriculum that will be beneficial to teachers and students in that the students have a unified set of tools that they use on a daily basis. As I previously mentioned",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Due to an on-going partnership with Soledad Enrichment Action Charter School, it will be relatively simpe to build a clientele base. The school lacks any programs that promote college education and/or encourages students to race to the top. The school has 17 separate locations totaling 1500 students."

    "summary": "The ongoing development of LA’s light rail network is one of the city’s largest transportation investments since the construction of the original freeway system and will undoubtedly shape the future of LA. Then as now, this construction is happening in the middle of existing neighborhoods, providing new opportunities while threatening the social fabric of established communities.\n\nLA Metro is about to start construction of the Little Tokyo/Arts District Regional Connector Station, starting with demolishing all buildings at the southeast corner of 1st/Central. One of these buildings, now home to Senor Fish restaurant, previously housed Atomic Cafe and the Troy Cafe, which were for decades significant cultural and social anchors for Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, and the Arts District. While the light rail network physically connects LA’s neighborhoods, we have a short window of opportunity to shed light on a little known part of LA’s history and create human connections that will last for generations.\n\nThis project proposes a creative placemaking project centered around the station, slated to begin construction at the beginning of 2014. We propose 2 interconnected projects: (1) the launching of a campaign to create a permanent art installation in remembrance of the vibrant and historic LA music scene of the Atomic Café, Troy Café, and the Arts District with a kick-off celebration in Fall of 2013; and (2) a campaign to preserve the original building, scheduled for demolition by Metro, that housed both the Atomic Café and Troy Café, and served as a common meeting space for artists from Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, and the Arts District in the ‘80s and ‘90s.\n\nThe Little Tokyo/Arts District station site is an important, but relatively unknown, marker in the history of Los Angeles’ music community. The Atomic Café, a long-time local Japanese neighborhood restaurant, was transformed in the early 1980s into one of the City’s hottest gathering spots for the burgeoning punk rock scene. Bands from across the nation and even from overseas could be found hanging out with the locals afterhours on a regular basis. According to its owner, Blondie, The Go-Gos, X, David Byrne, and David Bowie were among the Café’s patrons. Although the Atomic Café closed in the late ‘80s, the space maintained its artistic and musical spirit as the Troy Café in the ‘90s, hosting a vibrant Chicano music scene and serving as a critical venue for Boyle Heights and Eastside community musicians. Nearby, in the LA Arts District, places such as Al’s Bar stood for many years as another focal point and launchpad for local artists and musicians emerging from the underground scene to national and international prominence.\n\nOur first project is to launch a campaign for a permanent art installation to capture this rich history by (a) gathering stories through one-on-one interviews, (b) creating an interactive platform for all Angelenos with a connection to these venues to share their stories, and (c) celebrating this movement with a live program in the fall of 2013.\n\nOur second project is a campaign to preserve and relocate all or part of the original Atomic Cafe building located at the station site. When completed, the Little Tokyo/Arts District RCS will be one of the busiest transit hubs for Metro’s light rail station, providing access to 90,000 passengers every day and attracting visitors, investors, and developers to Little Tokyo and the Arts District. However, the station will eliminate this cultural gem and clear away a rich history. Instead, we want to preserve it future generations. In the face of this imminent loss, we will knit together three neighborhoods - Little Tokyo, the Arts District, and Boyle Heights - with all Angelenos in a celebration of music, culture, and history. We will work with historic preservation, engineering, and design consultants on a preservation and relocation solution. Metro requires that the building be relocated by the end of 2013, otherwise it will be demolished taking with it this piece of Los Angeles’ history. We hope to catalyze a local and regional scale social connectivity that will last for generations of Angelenos to come.\n\n",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "For over 30 years LTSC has been serving the Japanese/Japanese American community in the Greater Los Angeles area as the only regional provider of bilingual and bicultural social services. LTSC reaches 18,000 people each year. A significant proportion of our clients come to us from the broader Japanese/Japanese American community members who seek services such as child abuse prevention, consumer education, senior services, case management, individual and family counseling, and cultural education for children and youth.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "This project will involve partners from the Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, and Arts District neighborhoods. We will collaborate with local artists, musicians, residents, and stakeholders of these neighborhoods. Finally, we will invite all Angelenos to share their memories and experiences of these neighborhoods and arts venues via an interactive platform.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "This project benefits not just the local neighborhoods and communities adjacent to the Regional Connector Station, but all of Los Angeles. Los Angeles has many hidden historic and cultural gems tucked away in a myriad corners of the City’s rich tapestry, created and destroyed over many iterations of land development over the decades. Our project sets to proactively preserve and celebrate this unique chapter in Los Angeles’ artistic and cultural history.\n\n",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In 2050, Angelenos are connected to each other. We are connected physically by the expansion of our transit system that allows us to access and discover the rich breadth of neighborhoods in Los Angeles--neighborhoods like Little Tokyo and the Arts District. But these physical connections will also connect us to our history in meaningful and engaging ways. We can disembark at a train station and learn about a Los Angeles from a previous era. A resident from the west side will connect with someone from Boyle Heights, or Little Tokyo and share a human connection. The Arts District will still be a place for artists and musicians to congregate, share their art with the world, and live and work alongside each other. The city would be criss-crossed with resonant social connections across neighborhood lines, racial and ethnic lines, class lines, into a living, breathing mosaic.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "We will measure success by a number of different metrics. First, successfully preserving at least some portion of the former Atomic Café and Troy Café building must occur by the end of 2013 to meet Metro’s strict construction schedule. The preservation of the physical edifice would symbolize the preservation of our combined history and culture. Second, we will measure success in the number of stories gathered by interviews. Third, we will be successful if we establish our interactive platform and we gain participation from Angelenos. Finally, we will measure attendance of the live program and the number of individuals and organizations that “buy-in” to our movement."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Droplabs",
    "summary": "The Moebius Incubator is a start-up incubator based in Los Angeles with two aims: to dive deep into the problems of making great products and to make companies that are both profitable and socially beneficial. Our dream is to seed a new culture of entrepreneurship. L.A. is currently rated 3rd in the world for start-ups (as seen in the Startup Ecosystem Report: http://reports.startupcompass.co/StartupEcosystemReportPart1v1.2.pdf). We aim to leverage this strength in order to address the problems of employment and income disparity L.A. faces. The Moebius Incubator attempts to innovate on the incubation cycle, and in so doing make entrepreneurship more socially relevant and available as a career to a broader pool of people. Our first innovation is to directly tackle the problems of making great products: namely engineering and design. Many incubators currently rely on the talents of their participants to develop great products. We believe we can support entrepreneurs in this process. Both research and traditional wisdom indicate that project-based and contextual learning goes the deepest and lasts the longest. We propose a model of incubation which provides not only support for traditional business development but also engineering and design. We aim to do this in two ways. One is to develop a best practices model: what work out there is most relevant to the engineering and design experience in 2013? By establishing a canon of the best design — from the revered practices of Edward Tufte to the contemporary practices of Bret Victor — as well as the best engineering — ranging from the new wave of real-time frameworks such as Meteor.JS to the visionary work of computing legend and Los Angeles based Alan Kay — we believe we can give our entrepreneurs a strong starting point to work in the information economy. Secondly, we aim to hire in our incubator a design and engineering coach to provide weekly support and mentorship for projects. By shifting away from a class based model and to a project-based model, we adapt what we have seen to work in the best K-12 education (such as San Diego’s High Tech High) to the entrepreneurial space. We will also have a business mentor — recognizing the depth of service incubators currently provide in shaping business plans and facilitating hard-to-find connections to investors. Our other major innovation as an incubator is to select companies along two metrics: profitability and social good. We deeply believe that the most profitable work will be the work which helps individuals, families, and cultures grow. Apple has been a testament to the profitability of beautiful design. We seek to expand on their vision and look for other opportunities where human development — be it individual or cultural — and entrepreneurship can be aligned. The question of evaluating socially meaningful work and having it survive the necessary pivots of business will be a challenge. We draw inspiration from organizations like Givewell.org that through a research based approach we can understand what truly will help our society and shape our companies accordingly. While this work — of evaluating companies for social good — will be a continued research process, we believe signs like the UN ratification of the triple bottom line in 2007 ( ) show that we are ready for the development of further metrics for business success alongside the classical revenue and profit based metrics. Logistically, we aim to host our first class from late September to December of 2013, using the grant funding to run operational costs. We aim to raise seed funding for the companies separately. May to September will be spent interviewing candidates, researching best practices in engineering, design, and incubation, and hiring mentors for the launch. Our short time line will let us see how viable this model is quickly. Our dreams are to find the momentum to seed a new culture of innovation in Los Angeles — one with it’s own clear and unique character. We believe that entrepreneurship can grow in two ways: by becoming a force in the care of our city on all fronts, and by becoming a career path that a wide swath of people see as viable for themselves. Our strategy — to support the growth of entrepreneurs on all fronts and to engage a second social metric as a requirement for success — aims to provide the roots required. We believe that in 2050 entrepreneurship is something Los Angeles can look at with gratitude for both what is has done for us as well as who it lets all of us become.",

Models such as the triple bottom-line (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line) serve as inspiration for us.

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "URBAN AIR",
    "summary": "Urban Air is a project that transforms existing billboards into living, suspended bamboo gardens. Embedded with intelligent technology, Urban Air is at once a provocative artwork and a crack in the urban skyline meant to surprise, inform, suggest, and create a visual respite for a road weary city. With a donated billboard over one of LA’s busiest freeways, the façade of the billboard will be removed and replaced with architecturally integrated planters. Imagine being stuck in traffic, channel surfing on the radio, nothing but billboards with advertising on the skyline, and up pops a cluster of suspended living bamboo with water misters creating a visual cloud forest. As per artist Stephen Glassman, Urban Air is an opportunity for people to “look up, feel themselves as human, and conceive of what might be.” Beginning with one billboard, Urban Air intends to take an infrastructure that is only meant for modern advertising and commerce and create something accessible, inspiring, and altogether different - art for art’s sake in a social, urban, and ecological context. Billboards right now exist mostly as visually opaque structures, like boarded up windows on the horizon. Urban Air transforms them into portals… Open windows that connect the viewers not only to the sky but also to their own sense of humanity, and ultimately and potentially, to other Urban Air billboards around the globe. Urban Air is about transforming structures often seen as urban blight into living metaphors. While Urban Air is primarily an artwork, each “green” board will also be a “hotspot” that measures and wirelessly communicates the comparative air quality of its internal microclimate relative to its surrounding area via the internet. We are reportedly exposed to up to 5,000 advertisements alone per day. And it has been said that the average city dweller is exposed to as much information in one day as the average Victorian was in a lifetime. When advertising is replaced with art, something that is purely visual and intended only to be looked at and experienced, we all win. Urban Air becomes a global node, an open space in the urban skyline intended to inspire and revitalize, at once an artwork, a symbol of, and an instrument for a green future.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Stephen Glassman Studio first raised widespread critical acclaim in the early 1990’s creating free-form bamboo installations for devastated urban sites in the aftermath of the Rodney King Riots, Malibu Fires, and Northridge Quake. Since then, Stephen Glassman Studio has gone on to do significant large-scale projects including a 4,000 square foot sculpture plaza at the LNR Warner Center, the Fairmont Skate Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, Arkansas’ Southeast Shear (an NEA & White House Millennium Project), the Sylvia Campuan Bridge in Bali, and more. Stephen Glassman Studio has collaborated with architects such as Sasaki, Steinberg, Miller / Hull, and Arup Engineering as a creative consultant to urban master planning, as well as in the creation of commissioned art works for large-scale projects. Glassman is the recipient of numerous grants and awards including the NEA, Nathan Cummings Foundation, LA Cultural Endowment, and was a 2000 Chrysler Design Award nominee. Stephen Glassman Studio’s work has been collected and exhibited throughout Southern California, New York City, and internationally. The design and concept for Urban Air first received notice when it won the 2011 London International Creativity Award. As a successful Kickstarter project Urban Air went on to generate international dialogue about the nature of advertising and the role of art in communities, garnering support from over 1500 people internationally, with the film about it receiving over 150,000 downloads in 125 countries. Urban Air has been written about in countries around the Globe including Japan, Greece, Egypt, India, China, Russia, Italy, Peru, Brazil, France, England, Taiwan, Italy, Poland, and by publications and/or programs including The Huffington Post, Wired (Italy), LA Times, National Geographic, Forbes, Dwell, Landscape Architecture, DAD (Peru), Good Magazine, NPR, KCET, The Discovery Channel and more. Urban Air is currently slated as a main stage presenting project for The NYC Green Festival this upcoming April. Since its publication internationally Stephen Glassman Studio has received interest and inquiries from all over the world about the possibility of Urban Air projects in other cities... and the work of the studio, including Urban Air, has been the subject of collegiate studies at Vassar College, Syracuse University, Hampshire College, and other institutions.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The first and most important measure of success is a prominent, fully produced and realized Urban Air billboard at a significant intersection or at a major thoroughfare in Los Angeles by the end of 2013. However, its realization alone is only the beginning of the equation. As the piece is intended to be a catalyst, the impact it generates is of equal, if not greater importance. Urban Air must inspire widespread and formidable dialogue, a matrix that can be tracked to some extent through media coverage. Likewise the amount of interest and inquiry by other cities to create like projects will indicate a measure of success. As has been done to date, we will note success in the ability of Urban Air to inspire academic curriculums, generate college classes and workshops, and stimulate other professional collaborations and artistic endeavors. An important evaluation will be the goal of shifting the edges and territories of art, building, and infrastructure in the public realm. For example, Arup Engineering is already beginning in-house conversations to explore the possibility of public building – both art and architecture – as possible creative and beautiful solutions to a greener urban future.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Urban Air is a public artwork that also puts an active face on the possibility of urban sustainability. Urban Air will bring an urgency and vibrancy to the civic landscape, inspire community dialogue and action, beautify transit corridors, and ultimately connect people. Much like a modern city, bamboo is at once both vertical and horizontal. Each culm is connected to and sustained by the others through a vast rhizome network. Like streets, mass transit, or electrical grids in a modern city, everything and everyone is connected. The health of any individual within such a system is ultimately dependent on the health of the system as a whole. Urban Air will contribute to the overall health of Los Angeles.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The success of Urban Air in 2050 would look something like this: A driver in LA would see a plethora of Urban Air, and Urban Air inspired constructions gracing the skyline. Bamboo and other living plant life would be integrated with art on the edifices of the built environment. There would be Urban Air billboards by an array of different artists as part of the Clinton C40 Initiative – a combined effort of the 40 largest cities in the world to reduce their carbon footprint by the year 2020. These “greenboards” would be catalysts for the way we think, act, educate, advertise, and integrate both the arts and greening of our cities. There would be additional Urban Air or Urban Air inspired billboards in other cities around the globe. Many edifices around LA, as well as elsewhere, would be exploring the use of art as an initiative in and of itself – “art for arts sake” – as well as potentially for integration in socially and aesthetically conscious ad campaigns. The urban advertising landscape would be transformed to become another layer of serviceable urban infrastructure. Campaigns and companies themselves would be taking a different approach to the use of billboards, frequently integrating environmental sensors to measure air quality and otherwise concerning themselves not just with commerce but with providing service and both integrating and communicating aesthetics and sustainability. Universities and schools would regularly offer courses studying the use of both art and sustainable concerns in advertising and in platforms traditionally used for advertising. Commercial architectural projects would integrate Urban Air inspired billboards as part of their initial architectural planning and design, rather than as a post construction after thought. Conversations and dialogue around the way we experience and use art, aesthetics, sustainability, technology and commerce would have expanded and changed significantly in ways that major cities approach both the integration of arts, sustainability and economy throughout the world, so that he human experience of living in cities would be significantly improved.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "LAXART",
    "summary": "As the leading independent nonprofit contemporary art space in Los Angeles, LAXART is linking contemporary art and community—a vital coalition in an international city bursting with creative innovators. Dedicated to artistic and curatorial freedom, LAXART supports ambitious and experimental exhibitions and public art projects with emerging and mid-career artists that respond to the cultural climate of the city. In collaboration, we produce new artwork that takes conceptual and material risks; work that is unlikely to be realized within the traditional museum setting, but is an important part of the story of L.A.’s dynamic art scene. A key component of our artist-centered programming, LA Public Domain (L.A.P.D.) art initiatives literally bring art out of the gallery space and to the streets. The program provides a platform and support for aspiring and critical public interventions that engage diverse audiences and respond directly to urban spaces. Aligned with the LA2050 approach, L.A.P.D. shares the innovations of the next generation in new and exciting frameworks; this year, two sculptural installations in public parks, five billboards across the city, and a commissioned mural on our own building façade. The 2013 L.A.P.D. showcases LAXART’s unique programming model and continues our record of success in the public domain. Los Angeles-based artist Anna Sew Hoy has proposed a site-specific sculptural public art installation at Kings Road Park in West Hollywood. Responding to the park’s constellation-like design with a water fountain, waterfall, jungle gym, and seating, Hoy will create a dimensional work made of glazed stoneware, painted hoops, and an embedded mirror to highlight the act of seeing, offering passersby a viewfinder, a mirror reflection, and an opaque silhouette. Visitors will be able to see something new every time they visit by reflecting different views as they navigate the natural surroundings. LAXART will also produce the first public artwork with L.A. artist Sam Falls. Inspired by the history of minimalist sculpture and an interest in photography, he is creating a post-minimalist aluminum sculpture with paint that fades in the sunlight over time. A site-specific work weighing approximately 250 pounds, the piece will have colored panels that could shift from dark to light over the course of a day. The work will be installed in conjunction with a major exhibition, billboard project, and publication at LAXART in November, and may remain on-site for as long as two years. Billboard art has been a signature of LAXART since 2006. Whether an element of an artist’s first solo exhibition or as part of a major regional survey, billboards allow artists to break from tradition and share their ideas in large-scale. In 2013, five L.A.P.D. artists will be added to a list that includes Raymond Pettibon, Walead Beshty, Mungo Thomson, Doug Aitken, Mark Bradford, Charlie White, Kate Costello, Roy Dowell, Fay Ray, Meg Cranston, Harrell Fletcher, and more. LAXART’s Culver City site has always had a direct relationship with the street and that expressive presence connects community members with the work. The first painting on the façade, by Daniel Joseph Martinez, presented a composed text that read, “beauty… it rubs against one’s tongue it hangs there hurting one insisting on its own existence finally it gets so one cannot stand the pain then one must have beauty extracted.” This project became a part of the identity of the space, as an emblem for the organization that creates dialogue inside and out. Since then, artists such as Karl Haendel, Sanya Kantarovsky, Dianna Molzan, and the renowned L.A. collective Slanguage, have used the façade as their canvas. In 2013, a new L.A.P.D. wall mural on our La Cienega building will be viewed by thousands of drivers and pedestrians traversing on the iconic L.A. thoroughfare. The L.A.P.D. program impacts L.A.’s arts and cultural vitality in the long-term, as it explores the myriad ways that artists speak to audiences and expands the field of how they make work. Each new project gives new perspective on current practices and reveals how city audiences are engaging with the work. LAXART continues to question of the validity of given contexts for the exhibition of contemporary art, architecture, and design. As the forum evolves, we can work toward a new, progressive exhibition modeled after L.A.P.D., with a range of work that lives in the L.A. cityscape with vast accessibility—instead of entering a formal institution to find art, locals walk out their front door and encounter art as they go about their day. This momentum is building toward our most significant exhibition to date, The Occasional, a citywide initiative based on international artist residencies and newly commissioned work in experimental contexts throughout the city that give the public opportunities for interaction with artists from around the world.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "A thriving artist community would be evidence of a healthy Los Angeles in 2050. The culture is at its best when bolstered by the influx of young artists eager to train at our world-class schools and technical centers, launch their careers amidst a diverse fraternity of creative contemporaries, and define our living landscape with distinctive public artworks. We want to create sustainable program for a new generation of artists and curators living and working in our city. As the Foundation reported, L.A. is currently home to the largest concentration of working artists in the nation, and we hope to establish an infrastructure that can encourage and support their work and allow for a steady growth in the artist population. The arts sector needs to multiply in tandem, with a contingent of professionals and organizations as resources for the diverse art-makers who will come to our city from around the world, seeking the freedom to share their ideas in a form that represents their vision and skill.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Our approach to evaluation is through a self-study process. LAXART measures the success of its exhibitions and education efforts via regularly scheduled curatorial meetings and evaluation sessions amongst staff, advisory board members, and executive board members. We gather press reviews, attendance figures, and comments from the general public, participating artists, curators, and scholars. The director and curators assemble a summary evaluation plan that includes each year’s accomplishments and activities and submits the document to the governance committee for review.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Many major cities have flourishing public art programs that help define the urban landscape and build awareness of contemporary art and culture, yet Los Angeles is lacking in this arena. Through L.A.P.D., LAXART is filling this gap by bringing art to the streets, and inspiring residents to engage with the work. Public artworks can change misconceptions about contemporary art and grow new and diverse audiences, as the art experience changes from a static gallery visit to an organic encounter that is meaningful and inspires dialogue. We are developing a larger audience for the arts in L.A. outside the traditional viewing context, and with repeated exposure, a public that feels ownership of and embraces artwork that emerges locally."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Ryman Arts",
    "summary": "Our idea is to build on our Big Draw LA campaign, which entails organizing a month-long series of inclusive, highly participatory public drawing experiences across Los Angeles at traditional and non-traditional venues. Through the month of October, we create and promote community drawing events at a diverse pool of venues such as museums, libraries, senior centers, restaurants, bars, parks, science centers, retail stores, or any other establishments that can help us get the public drawing! The Big Draw LA initiative, which we are presenting for the fourth year, will build community, entice non-professionals to make art, and encourage the public to value drawing as a tool for their own creative expression. When Ryman Arts first launched The Big Draw LA in 2010, it was an experiment. Based on our experience, we now see that this initiative has deepened our involvement with the larger community and broadened our own program’s students' experience, thus strengthening our core program while at the same time cultivating the well-being and quality of life for our fellow Los Angelenos. The BDLA also includes our organization’s flagship event, “Make Your Mark in the Park” where both our students and alumni encourage and engage the public to make art. A fun-filled, creative afternoon, we celebrate the act of drawing by welcoming thousands of Angelenos to draw together on paper rolled out along the length of an iconic Los Angeles park. After, the drawing is photographed and showcased as a scrolling panorama online. Last year’s event was held at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles where thousands captured the spirit of Grand Park and downtown Los Angeles. Students from our Ryman Arts program were on site to provide the public with art supplies and encouragement. The Big Draw LA ensures that we can continue to educate young artists on the value of community engagement, build awareness of the value of art making, and increase opportunities for artistic participation among the greater Los Angeles public. All of these lead to an increase in public participation, and appreciation of both formal and informal arts events, and impact on Los Angeles’ role as a leader in the arts. We hope to reach as many Los Angelenos as possible at our proposed BDLA events, allowing a broader mix of the public to engage directly with making art in their specific LA communities. Funding will allow us to try more unusual venues, work with smaller community organizations that need more support to develop their BDLA events, and develop new tools to link events with online components—ultimately, increasing access to the project.",

Ryman Arts executive director Diane Brigham and our staff have a strong commitment to the philosophical underpinnings of the initiative and gained unparalleled experience in both producing large scale public drawing events in complex collaborations, and coordinating the efforts of numerous and varied groups who produce their own BDLA events. Our organization has engaged over 65 organizations in The Big Draw LA, leading to over a hundred public drawing events. Approximately 8,000 members of the community have participated in The Big Draw LA flagship events, “Make Your Mark in the Park”. The success of The Big Draw LA initiative mirrors the success of its presenter, Ryman Arts.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "By using both traditional and non-traditional venues such as parks, public libraries, community centers, city streets, parking lots, theaters and train stations, we are able to reach underserved Los Angeles populations that may not seek or view art in their day-to-day activities, and engage them in the act of creation. Participating in art making and cultural activities leads to a stronger community and enhances human development at the individual level.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Over 65 organizations have partnered with The Big Draw LA in previous years ranging from LA public libraries to schools to shops. Additionally, we collaborate with numerous institutions (e.g. Active Arts at the Music Center), parks (e.g. Exposition Park and Grand Park), museums (e.g. The Huntington Library, The Getty, Craft and Folk Art Museum) and additional non-traditional facilities to expand the program’s reach to the widest geographic and broadest demographic possible. Over the past two years we have formed an informal advisory group made up of individuals who have demonstrated particular expertise and leadership in conceptualizing Big Draw LA activities. It is through these collaborations that we’ve been able to expand our reach.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "We will evaluate The Big Draw LA based on our objectives and expected outcomes. Our objectives are to encourage varied community organizations to organize events, and coordinate the overall presentation and marketing of at least 100 audience participatory drawing events designed especially for non-professional artists for the The Big Draw LA (BDLA) month of October; produce 1 \"flagship\" BDLA community art-making event in October reaching at least 3,000 people; support the development of engaging informal drawing activities that will involve the public actively in art-making by providing at least 40 planning events in advance that are geared to non-arts organizations and/or non-traditional arts venues; and foster the interaction of community artists with non-professional participants.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The Big Draw LA encourages participants to rediscover the power of drawing as both a tool and as a way of seeing the world. In 2050, the phrase “I can’t draw” would be removed from our collective rhetoric. Drawing, like speaking, writing and mathematics, would be a ubiquitous language of communication among all people. Drawing would be a basis for social interactions and understanding. Just as penmanship is secondary to the idea conveyed through language, one’s skill in drawing would be secondary to the concept being explored or exchanged with others. Tablet technologies, with their numerous drawing and collaborative whiteboard applications, are currently blurring the line between artist and non-artist and expanding the definition of drawing into a form of communication. Additionally the global connectivity of the internet allows us to share or even collaborate on drawings with people who speak different languages. With the Big Draw LA initiative, we hope that the year 2050 will be one of open, accessible, and welcomed participation in artistic and cultural activities without any feelings of unfamiliarity or intimidation for members of the Los Angeles community. This will also link directly with active engagement at our city’s many artistic and cultural offerings at both traditional venues (e.g. museums) and non-traditional venues (e.g. your local café or Laundromat). Overall, we will uphold the positive economic impact of these activities within our greater Los Angeles."

    "organization": "La Loma Development Company",
    "summary": "Our idea is to design, build, and operate a community center for the advancement of sustainable landscaping and permaculture jobs through green education, environmental resources, urban agriculture demonstrations and local food security programs. We would use $100,000 wisely to complete our center, ramp up programming, and open our doors to the broader public. We currently are located in a 30,000+ sq. ft. property in an Enterprise Zone, an underserved neighborhood (food desert), formerly a historic truck mechanic. For nearly six months we have been using our cash flow from La Loma to convert this location into a base of “post-industrial eco-renaissance.” We have also formed a non-profit, named Zanja Madre, to handle the education, training, and pro bono work we do for the community, schools, and institutions. For the La Loma Center, we have floated names like “Sustainia” and “Ecodepot,” but most importantly we have the place and people to do this now. The facilities would be perfect for job training, professional certification courses, events and even conferences. With creative reuse of the giant garages, mechanic bays, and grounds, we will be able to exhibit techniques and technologies, as well as provide the resources for the public to mimic the cutting edge demonstrations. We also have an adjunct vacant lot in LA where we demonstrate natural techniques on the land. Our idea clearly impacts nearly all of the indicators listed, however we will focus on income and employment after going through the rest of them. Education will be improved by providing classes at various levels in collaboration with local schools and universities, as well as professional certification and job training programs. We have active relationships with local high schools and community colleges, and the Art Center College of Design, Environmental Charter Schools, and LAUSD. Environmental quality will be impacted directly by the tools and resources we provide. Our jobs increase watershed awareness, irrigation conservation, rainwater harvesting, and planting appropriate trees. We design, build, and maintain organic gardens, as well as ecological restoration projects. We will demonstrate how individuals can improve their immediate surroundings through the landscape. Health has been shown to improve through environmental quality, practicing horticulture, and eating good local food. Our facilities and programs will improve people’s health by getting them to improve their lifestyles and connections to nature and community. Also, we are in contact with the director of the public health department to create the first local organic food commissary, hosting qualifying food trucks, food carts, and mobile farmers' markets. By providing access to local organic food we will eliminate food deserts and improve the health of the community. Social connectedness is one of our primary goals at the community center, networking between organizations and individuals to synergize the local sustainability movement. We already have become a hub for the permaculture world, making it feel like a small world with all of the relationships, and being invited to give talks at various conferences including Bioneers, Permaculture Convergence, Urban Ecology, and the Arboretum's Garden Show. Arts and cultural vitality will radiate from our center with the look and feel style of the place, arts exhibitions focused on land art, green building, and creative expression. We are a land based organization that believes our work is art and culture tied to the land. We are not your average mow and blow or construction contractor, we are a design-build firm with a social mission and a vision for the future. Moreover, La Loma provides jobs and income. This year alone we have created thirty jobs with no budget allocated to job creation, simply by employing and training a diversity of local workers in real green projects. We intend to dedicate our center to the creation of local wealth and sustainable livelihoods, by providing the tools and opportunities to do good for the local community and local environment. We are fully confident that La Loma Center will become the leading place to acquire knowledge, credentials, and opportunities for increased incomes and job creation. This is evident in our record of offering gainful employment, engaging workers' coops, and acting as an important stepping stone for dozens of careers.",

Our water shortages will be eliminated with a healthy watershed, an LA River that is vital and used for recreation and habitat. Aquifers will be recharged with smart use of rainwater and graywater, while intelligent landscaping will reduce our needs for irrigation. Urban agriculture will increase local produce, supplementing our diets while creating butterfly and bee habitat. People will have meaningful work that improves our public health and environmental quality. Community connectivity will be strengthened with regional hubs replicating our model.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Our project will benefit Los Angeles in numerous ways as was discussed above. Specifically, we will have a major impact on the creation natural parks, beautiful gardens, and public spaces to organize community. LA has a shortage of green spaces, we solve that problem. We will empower the community with information and work, hosting regular classes, community workshops, and job training on a variety of relevant sustainability issues. Specific subjects include Arboriculture, Aquaculture, Beekeeping, Soil, Water, Seeds, School Composting, Compost Tea, Vermiculture, Xeriscape, Drip Irrigation, Dry-Stacked Broken Concrete Terracing, Masonry, Carpentry, Metalwork, Edible Gardening, Food Preservation (solar dehydration, canning), Fruit Tree Pruning, Green Roofs, Greywater, Living Walls, Natural Building (cobb, adobe), Natural Pools, Permaculture, Rainwater Harvesting, Urban Agriculture, Rocket Stoves/Ovens, Solar Power, Conservation Remodeling, and so much more.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Besides our latest project at our center.... La Loma is a critical partner in the creation of Arlington Gardens, a three acre, award-winning community garden. We were also awarded the Green Hero Award by Environmental Charter Schools for the greening of their campus, which also received national attention as a runner-up in the White House Race to the Top contest. We received the Pasadena Beautiful Golden Arrow Award for our classic terraced vineyard project and other front-yard gardens. We were published on the cover of Landscape Contractor Magazine for our use of recycled concrete in beautiful, monumental projects, as well as stories in LA Times, Sunset, Pasadena Star, and others. We had an acclaimed installation, the Public Fruit Tree Theater, at LACMA that unfortunately was replaced by \"Levitated Mass.\" We have been publicly commended by several council members for our work at schools and other community projects, such as Plaza Morazan (Ed Reyes), Main St. Elementary (Jan Perry), Pasadena Senior Center (Steve Madison). We bioremediated our site, eliminating the gasoline, oil and chemicals. We are leaders of converting toxic chlorine pools into Natural Pools, that create habitat and store drinking water. We were called upon as an emergency responder to the recent windstorms, and we pride ourselves as being a force of nature for our community. Currently we are finishing a large Demonstration Garden for the Chino Basin Water District. Marco Barrantes was formerly a Parks and Recreation Commissioner, as well as a member of Food Policy Council, he wrote a book called \"Feed Your City: Urban Agriculture Food Systems.\" We are a registered Small Business, Minority Business Enterprise, and pre-qualified for projects with LAUSD, MWD, among other major institutions. We have created jobs and income during a recession, what more can you ask?",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "We will evaluate our projects by the number of jobs we create, the number of classes we hold, the number of job trainees we certify, the number of green projects we design, build and maintain, the amount of income we create for our workers and partners, the amount of income that goes back into the community through our non-profit arm, the number of members that join our community center and food commissary. The results will be easy to measure and straightforward. We will create good jobs, local wealth, neighborhood projects that can not be missed. Typically our gardens result in greater environmental awareness as is measured by testimonials and word-of-mouth. It is easy to measure our success by the gallons of water we capture or save, the number of trees we plant, the pounds of food we produce, the pounds of seeds we store and distribute, the tons of local waste we recycle into compost, mulch and building materials. By counting the number of visitors that come through our locations, the number of awards and publications we have received and will continue to win.",

    "organization": "California Greenworks",
    "summary": "California Greenworks, in partnership with Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries, proposes the “Million Reusable Bag Giveaway” pilot program, to create and distribute 25,000 reusable shopping bags (with an overall goal of 4 million) in lower-income Los Angeles neighborhoods as the City’s plastic bag ban goes into effect. Using informational inserts in the bags, we will spread the word about cost-saving and environmentally-urgent energy efficiency and water conservation programs. This program will positively impact at least four LA 2050 indicators by: 1) immediately increasing stable Income & Employment of two of LA’s most at-risk populations: homeless, disabled and returning combat veterans, and formerly-gang involved and recently-incarcerated men and women; 2) Educating low-income and traditionally difficult-to-reach populations about new energy efficiency and water conservation measures introduced by the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power (LADWP), thereby helping reduce their monthly utility and weekly shopping bills… 3) …while improving Environmental Quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in terms of electricity and water use, and reducing the use of single-use shopping bags which often become blight and part of the litter stream in our neighborhoods and waterways; 4) and building a bridge of Social Connectedness between two previously disparate communities who share similar challenges around assimilation and acceptance into the mainstream Los Angeles society. The Million Reusable Bag Giveaway pilot project will employ Green Vets LA veterans in making 25,000 reusable shopping bags, and Homeboy Industries in silk-screening them, and will engage City Councilmembers, Los Angeles neighborhood councils, faith-based and community groups and environmental organizations such as the Clean Seas Coalition, the Green LA Coalition and the LA Climate Action Coalition in distributing the bags. Once the pilot project is up and running, California Greenworks will continue the “Million Bags” fundraising process by involving local businesses (such as grocery stores, local utilities such as LADWP, sports teams such as the Dodgers, film studios, et al) to sponsor the project in exchange for their logos being imprinted upon durable shopping bags that will be used weekly by Los Angeles consumers for the five to ten year expected life of these durable shopping bags. The ultimate goals of the Million Bag project are to provide a free reusable shopping bag, with energy efficiency and water conservation tips within it, to every one of the nearly four million residents in the City of Los Angeles, to substantially reduce electricity and water use across the City, reduce greenhouse gas emissions as the threat of climate change looms, and, in the process, to create a sustainable sewing and silk screening industry staffed by at-risk populations who will benefit from a growing trend of plastic bag ban ordinances spreading across California, the United States and the world.",

    "slug": "2013/reclaimed-park-strand-project",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Urban Reclaim",
    "summary": "Access to parks is a major fallback for many neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Statistics from “Trust for Public Land”, No Space To Play, 2004 show that many of the areas with the highest children populations also have the least park access. The problem is not the lack of land, but the poor use of it. After researching old railroad lines in Los Angeles, we’ve stumbled upon strands of unused land left of from old railroad lines. One of these strands is from the Pacific Electric Exposition Line which ran from Santa Monica, to USC, and finally to the Los Angeles River. It was closed down many years ago, and recently the Metro Expo line has been over a portion of it from Culver City to USC, and north to Downtown. However, just east of the 110 Freeway, the remains of the old line carve thought city blocks, often gated off and unused or covered with asphalt to be used as parking. The project will be focus on reclaiming a part of this unused land that runs through two residential blocks and converting it to a green park strand. There are copious examples of land that used to serve now obsolete infrastructure being reused as public open space. One example is the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt which used to be another branch of the Pacific Electric Railroad, but has been converted into a green promenade for bicyclists, joggers, and pedestrians. It connects Marina Del Rey to Hermosa Beach. The vision for 2050 is to create a similar green strand that will connect USC to the LA River, and provide ample green park space to the neighborhoods in between. However, to undertake such a large project it is important to start small and create a catalyst for change. We believe this project can be the catalyst for change because it will address a lack of park access in the neighborhood, and create a foundation for further growth. We believe the site between Maple Ave and San Pedro St., and 30th St. and 32nd St. is an ideal place for a park because there are only 3 other parks within a mile radius to be used by the children of 7 schools within the same mile radius. The park will not only provide public open space, but it will also serve as a pedestrian promenade between 2 elementary schools -29th Street Elementary and Delores Huerta Elementary. The much needed open space will not only improve the environmental quality of the area, but also provide a pedestrian link between the school for children to use. It will further benefit the low income community because park proximity has a direct correlation to home values. Furthermore, with the park’s proximity to the schools, is can be used as an extension of the campuses for educational purposes. The park will have areas for relaxation and recreation, as well as a community garden. This garden will be open to the community and can be used by the elementary school for teaching. Adjacent to the site is the Crossing at 29th Street Development by UHC LLC (http://www.uhcllc.net/crossingsat29th.php) which is a multi-phased project that deals with re-zoning the currently industrial properties to be redeveloped as multi-family residential homes and supporting facilities. The master plan for UHC project also features a green promenade on the land which was used as railroad infrastructure. This project will directly link to the green space and provide an extension for the green pedestrian promenade. Looking toward 2050, the goal is to keep reclaiming the unused parcels of land and extend the promenade for pedestrians, joggers, and bicyclists to connect to USC and Exposition Park on the west, and the Los Angeles River in the East. Please see our video presentation for a graphic explanation of the project.",

Xander has been involved with organizations such as Global Architecture Brigades and helped design and fundraise for projects benefiting underprivileged communities in Central America. He currently works for June Street Architecture. Eric currently works at HNTB and is part of the new 6th Street Viaduct project team, working with city officials and community leaders on creating successful urban public spaces for the Los Angeles community.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "On an immediate timeline, the project will benefit the local residents by providing a public park space and a community garden. It will benefit 29th Street Elementary and Delores Huerta Elementary by provide a campus extension for the children to play, as well as create a pedestrian connection between the two. The initial benefits reflect mostly on improving environmental quality, but as the project grows, we are looking to also create a new strand for Connectivity for Angelenos. By 2050, we intend to create a pleasant rout for bicyclists and joggers from USC to the LA River, as well as children returning home from their respective schools to their home somewhere in between the two destination points.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "If we can get on our bikes and take and trek through an urban park from USC to the Los Angeles River, the project is a success. If there is more green space for children to play, we would consider the project a success. If the local communities have a place to gather, relax, and collaborate, the project is a success. If schools are linked by a green strip of parkland that children can use to get home rather than walking by industrial warehouses, the project is a success. If all these are true in 2050, the project has been executed in the way we envision it.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The project will be evaluation will be reflection of the impact on the community. We are eager to see of the new public green space being used by the local residents and schools. The best result would be full community and school engagement in the space, as well as creation of new educational or extra-curricular programs using the space. The more people use the space, the better we feel out putting our energy in creating it. We believe we can provide a foundation for the community to perpetuate our efforts. An example of this is creating the community garden – given the land, planters, soil, and seeds/plants for the garden; we will measure success by how much the community upkeeps and uses it. As the project grows, we will evaluate success in connecting to neighboring blocks and creating green public spaces from the currently unused lots. Our vision of success by 2050 is to connect a linear green promenade to USC and the LA River.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We plan of working with the community leaders and the city representatives heavily at the start of the project in order to attain the land and maximize its use. We also plan on working with the schools to get feedback for creating the best environment and programs for children, utilizing the newly reclaimed park space. We are also very eager to work and consult with UHC LLC about how to most beneficently connect the green public spaces to reinvigorate the neighborhood. Finally, we are excited to use our professional resources to collaborate with the community to create a space everyone can enjoy."

We are developing concrete projects aimed at making a real impact on not just the technology and innovation sectors of Los Angeles, but on how the citizens of Los Angeles interact with the city, businesses and each other. All projects are geared towards attracting, and retaining: diverse talent, entrepreneurs, businesses and capital to Los Angeles. In the last year we have begun: The Texpo Innovation Hubs LAMCII is working in a public/private partnership with the City of Los Angeles, local universities, and recognized environmentally conscious developers to transform city-owned properties along the Expo line transit corridor into ‘innovation hubs’. Innovation happens with diversity: different businesses and organizations bumping up against one another on a daily basis will bring about new and interesting ideas, projects and solutions. These hubs will provide world-class physical space for startups and new economy businesses as well as community space that serves the dual purpose of providing a resource to local groups, organizations, and citizens and exposing our friends and neighbors to the opportunities inherent within the tech sector. Phase one is underway at the Jefferson Transfer Yard, a 220,000 square foot facility slated to become the first Texpo Innovation Hub. LAMCII has identified four other sites along the Expo line that are earmarked for development in phase two of the project. Following the line to USC and Downtown LA, this will quickly enhance the flow-through of information and innovation. There will be bike rentals available at all of the Texpo Innovation Hubs, a small but powerful catalyst for green commuting, better relationships with the community, and better health for employees and residents. EdgeLA Fellowship Program We interviewed LAMCII members, many of whom own businesses in Los Angeles, and asked how many open positions are available at their companies. In August of 2012, from 25 members surveyed, there were over 550 open positions at local companies. Los Angeles County produces more graduates and has more residents holding PhDs than any other in America, but from our survey of Los Angeles universities, we know that at least 50% of engineering graduates leave Los Angeles. There is a huge opportunity for a stronger relationship between the nearly 1.1 million college students and businesses in the greater LA area, fulfilling the talent needs of LA’s growing entrepreneurial ecosystem. LAMCII seeks to bridge this gap by working with businesses, universities and city colleges to create the EdgeLA Fellowship program. The program will be a one-stop-shop to connect businesses looking for bright, well-educated talent with students looking for longevity and meaningful experiences. We are working with Internships.com, a local business, to build a platform that makes it easy for students and businesses to connect with and navigate the myriad of opportunities available in LA’s innovation and tech communities. Launching in 2013, the EdgeLA Fellowship Program creates an unprecedented citywide conduit for students and businesses and paves the way for the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. The EdgeLA Awards The EdgeLA Award is not a recognition of achievement. It is an award to help an idea or product that needs significant support to get to market. It is an “X-Prize” styled venture meant to attract world-changing ideas, innovation and creativity from all over the world to Los Angeles by offering a significant financial award, mentorship, and legal and marketing support from LAMCII’s partners. We will administer the contest in conjunction with Skild, an LA based company that creates platforms and provides services for competitions. The award will be presented at LA’s Leading Edge Awards, an annual showcase of the world’s most innovative ideas after 3 rounds. Entrants are accepted online from anywhere around the world. In round one, the top 20 ideas are selected through crowd voting and executive panel. Round 2 will consist of a 2 minute video pitch that will be featured on the EdgeLA website and again, voted on by the public for originality, realization and credibility. The top 5 teams will move on to the finals. There will be one winner, but all finalists will receive prizes and support from LAMCII.

Composed of a senior corps of emerging platform strategists, Curious Catalyst engages subject matter expertise as well as citizen stakeholders to develop breakthrough MVPs. We use a license model to incentivize project pioneers to open the core of the solutions we develop to other mega-cities. For example, when we design a business model for addressing food deserts in Los Angeles, the plug-and-play core “Experience Blueprint” will be released to other cities for a nominal license fee; this positions the pioneers as leaders in a given area of urban challenge but benefits the broader global community while providing upside to the initial stakeholder.

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "There is no reason that the simple pleasures and benefits of fresh food that are enjoyed by citizens in Santa Monica can’t be found in any other corner of the city. Like a small house that is expanded room by room, until the wiring is a disastrous fire hazard, the LA sprawl has created pockets of neglect that leave citizens with unequal opportunity and weaker connections to the prosperity that the rest of Los Angeles enjoys."

    "summary": "Founded in 1999 V2K H.E.L.P.E.R. Foundation (formerly known as Venice 2000) is a non-profit organization that was originally established to provide gang intervention and prevention services. Since that time, we’ve come to believe that “community-intervention” services are needed now more than ever to combat gang-related violence, the destruction of our communities and the loss of our young people to the lure of economic depravity. The goal of V2K H.E.L.P.E.R. (Help Establish Learning Peace Economics and Righteousness) Foundation is to provide the resources and guidance to help struggling youth and community members of all ages make the transition from negative, anti-social behavior to positive, value centered alternatives. Working in some to the most challenged neighborhoods in Los Angeles HELPER Foundation changes young lives, and in doing so it is changing the city one child, one family at a time. The organization’s mission enables to foster strong, self sufficient family’s, joyful and resilient children and vibrant safe communities. In this program we propose to improve public safety by focusing on the primary systems of internal family structure through a comprehensive V2K-HELPER -“ Y.O.U.,” Wrap Around approach. Our family support work is predicated on the assertion that outcomes for youth cannot be separated from family conditions since families are the primary system for promoting children’s physical, emotional, and cognitive development. As we know once we change the economic structure of the family, improve family conditions emotionally, and physically we are likely to reduce levels of violence and create safer communities. Our programs are organized into three programmatic divisions that synergistically reach all members of the community in a wrap around fashion. Our programming provides Child & Youth Development programs provide at-risk children and young people a range of activities designed to enhance their healthy, pro-social development and address issues that include self-efficacy, self-confidence, resilience, peaceful co-existence, anti-bullying, mentoring, and life success. Parent Education & Family Development programs work with parents to develop their capacity as advocates and champions for their children and to enhance their ability to achieve economic stability and success. Mental Health programs assist children, youth and adults by providing them the tools needed to enhance social and relationship connections and emotional health. Youth Outreach Unit V2K Community Development Program has five components and implementation is carefully sequenced over a 12 month period. These five components of the program target the risk factors related to prevent anti-social behavior, incarceration, gang involvement and substance abuse. ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT LIFE SKILLS / PARENTING COMPONENT SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL COMPETENCE ANTISOCIAL /AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR; VIOLENCE WHOLE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH The program works to improve the planning and organizational effectiveness of the collaborative and parents; the use of the successful integration of workshops, classroom instruction, and the implementation of positive behavioral programs, Public Safety and Community Awareness . It is the Wrap Around Approach that enhances our ability to present programming that build and develops the entire family unit. Thus servicing Youth, Family and Community. The following constituencies and services will be provided under the program umbrella titled “Y.O.U” (Youth Outreach Unit). All services and activities are strategies for youth violence prevention and intervention. • Forty (40) at-risk middle and high school youth ages of 12 to 21 will participate in programming that focuses on (Resilience, Reasoning, Responsibility and Respect) receiving mentoring and life skills training. •\tAll participants come together in the Y.O.U. (Youth Outreach Unit). “Y.O.U.” implements a unique mentoring model that uses a cross generational approach to violence prevention/intervention. The participants of the programs will implement IMPACT sessions. Specific activities in the violence prevention programs include: •\tSelf management, social, interpersonal, and emotional (expression, understanding and regulation) skills training. •\tBehavior monitoring and reinforcement •\tBuilding school success capacity •\tCooperative Learning •\tProblem solving skills development •\tPromotion of cognitive and moral reasoning skills •\tDevelopment of positive peer relations •\tCreation of a positive , anti-bullying climate The programs have demonstrated positive effects on several risk factors associated with violence including aggressive behavior, anxiety and depression, conduct problems and lack of self control.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Wayfinder LA",
    "summary": "Our idea is a mapping and navigation tool designed for car-free transportation in Los Angeles. It will use road quality, public transit, and crowd-sourced geolocation data to suggest routes of travel using the three main alternatives to car travel: walking, biking, and public transit. Walking, biking, and public transit are superior to car travel because they pollute little, alleviate traffic congestion and infrastructure decay, promote health through exercise, and grant mobility to a very broad segment of the population. Yet, 80% of commuters travel by car in Los Angeles because they feel the public transportation system is inadequate and slow and the prospect of alternative transportation is intimidating or too complicated to undertake. Our goal is to remove those unknowns to make alternative modes transportation more accessible to people than it is now. Wayfinder relates directly to four LA2050 indicators because it promotes car-free transportation, whose list of benefits is long and diverse. Wayfinder’s indicators are Environmental Quality, Health, Social Connectedness, and Income & Employment. Here’s why: Environmental Quality •\tWalking, biking, and public transportation omit drastically fewer polluting gases than cars do, which improves our air quality. •\tMaking alternative transportation more accessible to young people gives them better access to parks, which are instrumental to children’s wellbeing but are few and far between in Los Angeles. Health •\tWalking and biking are physical activities that promote health through exercise. This is especially important for children, who are 10% as likely to become obese if they are physically active than if they are not. Social Connectedness •\tPedestrians, cyclists, and public transit riders interact with Los Angeles and the people who live here far more than the driver that enters the freeway time warp and is spit out at the destination. This daily interaction with the community tightens the social web and increases trust and social engagement, which encourage political involvement and volunteerism. Income & Employment •\tDriving is expensive, and the burden of that expense falls most heavily on the poor. Gas costs can eat up as much as 10% of a low income family’s earnings, to say nothing of the other costs associated with driving a car. Walking, biking, and public transit are consistently less expensive than driving.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "In the short term, success is a high level of engagement in our resource. We want this to be such a useful utility that people use it all the time and suggest it to others. To get off the ground, we plan to create a map and navigation utility based on information we already know about the roads and transit systems in Los Angeles, but we think it makes most sense to rely on the collected experience of our users to determine the best ways to get around. As such, we plan for the final version of Wayfinder to use aggregated data gathered from users’ smartphones as they travel.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Wayfinder will benefit Los Angeles and its residents in two distinct realms: the social and the structural. Social benefits include to those that directly benefit individuals, like improved air quality, less expensive transportation, and increased physical exercise. The structural benefits are those that result from the coordinated activity of thousands of travelers and enable our urban planners to maximize the efficiency of our transit systems.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "We think we can help make noticeable change in the four indicator categories mentioned in question 1."

    "summary": "A community of a self-sustainable Earthships where artistic and innovative youths, (though not solely limited to this demographic), may pursue their dreams. This would serve as a sister community to Valhalla Montreal. We do not have the opportunity to act on our dreams at an early age. This freedom requires money. We become trapped. Youth is wasted in a materialistic and capitalistic world as we vie to become financially secure enough to pursue our passions. We get caught in the pursuit of material fulfillment. We become jaded. We lose sight of our true selves. Few die happy or fulfilled. Our dreams are stunted. Our energy is wasted in support of a business model that provides little for humanity's greater good. We have no option than to partake in the rat race. Unless we are blessed by being born into the correct family or experiencing a wild stroke of luck, we cannot survive and succeed in the physical manifestation of our innermost artistic desires. We have little time to spend on the person that truly matters: ourselves. Self-sustainable communities have the potential to revolutionize not just Los Angeles... but the world. They require a pioneer investment, but from that point forward sustain themselves by the upkeep of their inhabitants. After all is established and runs smoothly, money may cease as a necessity. Each day would be devoted toward inner growth and creating whichever art form we wished to pursue. There would be free exchange of materials. If inhabitants lived in complete harmony and felt positive energy toward their beautiful community, any negative tension or struggle for power would be eliminated. A screening process would be implemented until proven unnecessary. This society can only flourish with positive people who demonstrate true compassion. These people would channel their energy into its love, abundance, growth, and advancement. There are many negative beings who do not well-wish the world at present. If they were to became members early-on, their thoughts and vibrations could cause the community to fail. This is why Valhalla Montreal has an application process that includes multiple interviews and tasks to test the talent of potential members. Structure and stagnancy would entail a few hours daily devoted to community upkeep. Upkeep would be crafted in a fun, engaging manner. This would be views as acts of loving kindness that respect and nurture the environment that offers them its support, (cleaning, building, harvesting food, etc). A mandatory hour of daily meditation would be tailored as the individual sees fit. This would provide internal growth, healing, and evolution of well-being. It would be highly recommended that an hour be devoted to daily exercise. The body is a temple. It is the only thing we truly own. Exercise stimulates endorphins. Endorphins make us feel better and provide us with more energy. Innovative and fun exercise classes would be offered. Various offbeat and \"un-mainstream\" or uncommon classes and discussions about any and all interests would be offered. Different divisions would include: art, song, dance, poetry, sculpture, innovation, holistic healing, culinary, gardening, etc. Collaboration between divisions would be highly recommended. Major goals are to make everything as creative, innovative, thought-provoking, positive, and unique as possible. This would require members to think beyond, break boundaries, and firmly believe that anything is possible. Community participants would be surrounded by nurturing and open-minded people who do not pass judgement. It is hypothesized that, under such circumstances, members would feel such bliss that word of this lifestyle would spread. Others would open their minds, challenge their beliefs, and consider a new perspective toward community and reason for existence. Unlike other ‘hippie communities’, we are not shutting ourselves off from the world. We are doing everything possible to make this lifestyle universally appealing. We will be as loud as possible so that we’re either loved or hated, but never unheard of. The art, ideas, and inventions that could come to fruition from such surroundings would be of high commodity in the marketplace, should a system centered on monetary value continue to exist. It is time to try something new. The old methods have been tried and are not true. Once this idea is tested, there is no doubt of its success.

    "summary": "Composting extends the lifespan of existing landfills, protects water quality, prevents the release of potent greenhouse gases, and produces the best fertilizer plants have ever met. Currently, City Earthworm is already gearing up to make composting accessible, easy, and desirable to the residents of Santa Monica by providing affordable weekly food waste pickup. At the same time, we will complete the farm-to-table-to-farm circle by delivering the food waste to organic farms for composting and increase their food production. With the funds provided by My LA2050, we would be able to expand our service to residents, restaurants, grocers, and other commercial customers throughout Los Angeles County so that everyone would be able to compost. In addition, we will partner up with local schools to set up composting operations on-site. We provide the setup, training, and a service plan to make sure the school’s composting operation is truly functional. Tending the composting operation is simple and can be done with coordinated efforts by the school’s groundskeeper, cafeteria staff, and designated students. This model is based on a system that is commonplace in the United Kingdom, in which local residents and business pay community gardens to compost their food waste. Composting is tremendously beneficial for the environment. The following is a short list of reasons why it should become common practice: 1) Greenhouse gas emissions from food rotting in landfills would be dramatically reduced through composting. When food waste rots in a landfill, methane – a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 21 times that of carbon dioxide – is released into the atmosphere. Considering that Americans throw away nearly 40% of their food and that food is the single largest source of waste to landfills, composting food scraps instead of simply trashing them can dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 2) Existing landfill lifespans would be increased by composting. According to the 2006 Annual Report by Waste Management, existing landfills at that time had an average life of 28 years left. Land is one of Earth’s most precious natural resources. Using land for building new landfills or expanding existing ones is undesirable when it could be used for more productive purposes such as food production, housing, or habitat conservation. Even more importantly, landfilling carries significant negative environmental impacts and should be viewed as a last resort for waste disposal rather than the default path. 3) Water quality is preserved through composting. As mentioned above, composting diverts waste from landfills, which often contaminate groundwater supplies. Further, the use of compost in agriculture in place of synthetic fertilizers should be heavily promoted. Synthetic fertilizer causes algal blooms and aquatic dead zones when released into local bodies of water by rain or erosion. Naturally derived compost does not cause this harmful effect and, in fact, strengthens soil structure to reverse erosion. Compost has also been shown to significantly improve crop yield and strengthen plants’ resistance to disease. Furthermore, composting food waste instead of sending it to in-sink garbage disposals lessens the load on municipal wastewater treatment plants.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "City Earthworm was started with a single mission: to make composting a household activity. We designed and built the City Bin, a modern and compact indoor composter that will allow EVERYONE to compost, regardless of the size of their living space or yard. The City Bin will soon be in production locally in Los Angeles County and will be manufactured using recycled plastic.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The project will have achieved its goal by diverting waste from landfills through composting. Towards this, we will measure the weight of food waste picked up each week and sum up the total at the end of the year. An average family of four generates about 500 pounds of food waste per year. We hope to divert 25,000 pounds of food waste from landfills in the remaining half of 2013 (equivalent to participation from 100 households).",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "We at City Earthworm aim to make it easier for the residents and businesses of Los Angeles to lower their environmental impact. We hope that Los Angeles will continue (but at an accelerated pace) on the path to becoming an environmentally-oriented, sustainable city. In the year 2050, success with regards to environmental quality means that Los Angeles would have achieved and surpassed the 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels, as mandated by AB 32. We would be a zero-waste city, instead composting, recycling, or upcycling all of our waste. Composting would be mandatory for all organic waste. All Los Angeles farms would be organic, and most – if not all - produce and meats sold in grocery stores would be organically produced. Compost would be available free of charge to everyone for use in their own yards. Backyard vegetable gardens would be commonplace, and everyone would have easy access to fresh produce.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We will be sending food waste for composting to Burkart Organics Farm and Silver Lake Farms initially. As we expand our service and the amount of waste picked up increases, we will partner with additional farms.

    "summary": "My idea is for a program that simultaneously creates performance opportunities for emerging artists, additional jobs for dance professionals, and provides art and music education programs to schools in Los Angeles. For the past nine years, I have been developing this program. Now in its 15th production, the annual Dancescape show is a benefit dance performance that donates all of its profits to art and music programs in Los Angeles public schools. It regularly features between 150 and 200 performers at the student, pre-professional, and professional levels, representing various styles of dance ranging from ballet, contemporary and modern to Bollywood, hip-hop, and breakdancing, and everything in between. As Dancescape has grown over the years, we have been able to increase the number of participants in the yearly showcase, which has lead to an increase in the amount of funds raised, which in turn has lead to a greater amount of programs sponsored and students reached. Now that we are officially an incorporated and registered non-profit organization, we will be initiating our own education program in which our roster of professional choreographers and dance teachers will be hired to teach dance in schools around Los Angeles. Ultimately, the program will be timed so that the students participating in a Dancescape Ed program will be able to attend the Dancescape performance with their families, friends, and teachers – and possibly take the stage to perform. My program will greatly impact the arts and cultural indicator of Los Angeles by bringing numerous organizations together to solve city-wide challenges in a unique and sustainable way. The program is designed to cover much of its costs organically, so that as the program grows, so do the funds that are generated to keep the program growing. At the same time, Dancescape is supplementing diminishing arts education budgets in schools. These programs are often the first to be cut, further limiting children’s access to what is already perceived as an expensive pursuit. Dance, in particular, can be a very cost prohibitive activity considering lesson costs, dancewear, and required shoes. By providing dance lessons in LA classrooms or during after school programs located on campus, we not only remove the economic barriers, but also the need for parents to drive students to a different location. Dancescape also creates a nurturing creative environment for arts professionals across Southern California. Emerging artists are given the opportunity to exhibit their work in a professional environment, to gain credentials and footage, and interact with an active network of their peers. The structure of both the performance and the intended educational program helps to make classical, contemporary, modern and urban dance accessible to different demographics. It is not designed to compete with existing arts programs, but rather to bring them together for one cohesive celebration of the impact of dance on the human spirit.",

Dance lessons would no longer be limited to only those students with the financial means or access to the few charter schools that offered such programs. School administrators would no longer have to choose between cutting music and math, because my organization - or one of our partners - will have provided them with the funds and personnel to carry out a proven music education program. By 2050, we will have had 37 years to learn, to revise, to expand, and will have had over three decades of both students and teachers who have been involved in our program, and are ready to see it succeed. We will have a nurturing, cohesive network of dance and arts professionals throughout Los Angeles county working together with multiple school districts, building not only community, but a lifelong love and appreciation for the arts in many of their students. With more children participating in arts affordable arts related events and programs, Los Angeles will boast not only a greatly increased access to arts, but will also foster greater public support for them.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "We have grown Dancescape into a well-known and respected event that our previous participants looked forward to every year.

    "summary": "Imagine what life could be like if a teen in South Los Angeles could see more computers than liquor stores while walking home from school. Imagine if South LA did not have the highest unemployment rate in the city but instead produced the highest number of tech pioneers in the country. URBAN Teens eXploring Technology (URBAN TxT), a local nonprofit with a city-wide focus, seeks to accomplish that by building a technology innovation center in one of the most underinvested areas in the city. URBAN TxT will build a “hacker space” - a space with technology equipment and an open-door policy for everyone who wants to express creativity, address social issues through computer programing, and innovate through collaboration. URBAN TxT’s hacker space will also be BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) by providing wireless connectivity so that those with computers, tablets or phones can come in to work on individual or team projects. At this space you will find individuals with different levels of technology experience who will help each other master 21st century skills. In an area of the city where teens will come across more prostitutes than parks, a community space that unites technology and innovative thinking will transform the landscape of how the community interacts within itself and with the city. URBAN TxT’s hacker space is the next logical step for a program that has used computer programming and web development over the past three years to set inner city youth on a path of leadership and STEM careers. More importantly, the hacker space will be a sanctuary for the next generation of leaders so that they can learn the skills needed to fulfill today’s job opportunities and to excel in the jobs of tomorrow. URBAN TxT’s vision for a hacker space is bigger than a community center that uses technology to bring everyone together for an innovative and better future. It will prepare students for college and beyond, while empowering those not in school and educating parents so everyone can succeed in the working world. Investing in a South LA technology innovation center, or hacker space, means investing where we’ll see the biggest impact. The population of South LA is hungry for success and opportunity because life there does not offer an easy path. The area sees more than half of its students drop out of school. With 32% of African Americans unemployed and Latinos not far behind, it’s imperative we do something to shift trends and prevent further damage. URBAN TxT’s hacker space will empower a population that has a drive to succeed which has not yet been nurtured. Although the direct investment is localized to South LA, the benefits go past the city of LA. The space will be available to everyone who wants to use technology and creativity in a positive manner. Better yet, because technology breaks down physical barriers, a part of the city that currently has an abysmal 30% of homes with internet access could be connected to all parts of the world. URBAN TxT's hacker space will also provide a community space for schools, churches, non-profit organizations and others that need to add tech to their curriculums. The space will serve as a venue for community events, like the South LA Hack-A-Thon which already happened once in February and will happen again on April 13th, 2013, to further bring the community together. Education will be heavily impacted through URBAN TxT's hacker space. The initiative will increase attendance rates of inner city youth to 4-year universities, engage students in the educational process through a recreational outlet with professional benefits, and will increase scholarship opportunities by providing students with valuable skills and experience. URBAN TxT's hacker space will further impact education by uniting diverse and specialized skill sets thanks to and through partnerships. The space will allow for workshops on new programming languages, forums with founders of tech start-ups and team building activities using different educational techniques. The impact on the indicator can be predicted because URBAN TxT is already seeing these results. 100% of graduating seniors that go through URBAN TxT have gone on to 4-year universities, all students come out of the program with advanced tech knowledge, founders and executive from small and large tech companies are already involved, students have higher aspirations and confidence levels, and the program continuously explores learning methods that create accountability between students while producing better results. The group started out meeting at a local coffee shop already released its first product built by students, YouPolitic.me. Students built the online platform in the summer of 2012 as a way to engage high school students in the political process. The site runs mock elections, aggregates data and allows for easy sharing.

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Bringing LA’s most recognized industry into the classroom will have immediate AND long-range effects. The LA2050 Report states that 36% of LAUSD students do not graduate high school, adding “That’s up to 20,000 Angelenos entering the modern economy every year and competing without a high school degree.” Per LAUSD staff, this is a conservative number since it does not account for students who drop out before reaching high school. A student’s decision to drop out of high-school is frequently the result of negative school experiences (e.g., academic failure, suspensions) that often begin before the ninth grade. By targeting middle school students, LA Creates! is being designed to appeal to young people at an earlier stage in their education and serve as a catalyst to change this trajectory."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "arc",
    "summary": "MyArc is a flexible, content-agnostic digital media platform developed explicitly for educational purposes. It presents a secure, closed ecosystem in which students can connect with other students, both at their own school and outside; engage with industry experts, community leaders and academics; create and share projects and ideas; receive project or assignment feedback from students, teachers, and other members of the community; earn, collect and award badges in recognition of a broad spectrum of activities and achievements otherwise unrecognized by standard educational reward systems. MyARC builds bridges between individuals, classrooms, and schools. It connects in-school and after-school curriculum and facilitates the involvement of the larger community in the education process. It does all this by adapting the capabilities of the Web 2.0 social networking platforms to reframe the way we approach education and consider its constraints. Current educational programs, problems, and solutions, are based around and limited by the physical structures and geographic locations of schools. Experiments in higher education and the digital humanities have shown ways to use the Internet for educational purposes, but the students who would most benefit from such innovation (i.e. those in LA’s public school system) do not yet benefit from these practices. Yes, our students have access to technological tools and, often, even training on how to use them. But they are not able to use the Internet as the social network towards curricular learning. Web 2.0 has shown that the Internet is not just a place to get information; it is also, and perhaps more powerfully, a means of making connections between human beings, a tool for building communities and producing knowledge collaboratively. Social networking sites such as Facebook are rightly banned from school computers in order to protect our children. But what if these networks could be safely put to use in the education of our children? What if we could build a safe, protected online social network that fostered such activity as learning and extended classroom curriculum by connecting teachers, students, and communities across geographic locations? What if we could use the Internet to do what it was intended to do: to connect geographic sites and share information in ways that strengthen community? We can. It is called MyARC. MyARC adapts the strengths of the Web to serve the needs of our public high schools and after-schools in a safe and manageable way. Students create their own profiles and participate in “activities,” “clubs,” and “challenges.” They elect to join “clubs” based on their interests and to participate in “activities” and “challenges.” They communicate with other students around a shared interest or project. They can also read, research, and review educational tools and resources related to their topic so that MyArc serves as a virtual meeting place, a workshop, a research hub, an exhibition space, and an archive of collaborative process. Let’s take an extended and easily implementable example: students participating in after-school robotics clubs across Los Angeles. Students login to the “Robotics Club” space of MyARC and ask questions, share ides, comment on each other’s projects, and even work collaboratively but remotely. Teachers can oversee this correspondence and craft curriculum around it, building in challenges and badges. Experts from the community can login to follow the progress of this student robotics group. Local engineers or science professors can provide advice and encouragement, suggesting links to related topics or articles for further study. Local technology companies can offer prizes or post internship opportunities to the robotics club. As a result, an after-school program in inner-city Los Angeles will have access to human capital, resources, and networking opportunities usually reserved for the privileged and few. We need funding to build MyARC. We have already designed the interface and most of its functionality. We need support to build and beta-test the prototype. Though our pilot is targeted towards high school students, we are designing the tool to be scalable and flexible so as to support diverse learning communities. The web-space will be secure and protected; content will be monitored for accuracy by experts residing both within the ARC team and on an extended Advisory Board (see partners). We are in a unique position of being able to easily implement the platform once it is built because MyARC will be supported and implemented by ARC: an after-school and experiential education provider (see section below). MyARC provides a central hub for learners, educational institutions, and other organizations to share, exhibit, and learn. MyARC is a digital social network, a safe space for project-based learning that solves educational challenges one project and one student at a time.",

We will also pursue interpretative evaluations to determine what types of activities are most engaging; which activities attract the most users and which demand the most involvement? We will also use user surveys to track attitudinal shifts about learning to see how students perceive the success of MyARC as it emerges. Finally, we will work with our partners—teachers, administrators, and educational foundations-- to determine appropriate metrics for tracking connections between use of MyARC and student test scores, job applications and acceptances, college admission rates, etc. Success will be measured in datasheets and individual narratives, statistics and quotations.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "With a simple technological platform and a management staff to properly implement the site and ensure student safety, MyARC can facilitate a meaningful transformation in the educational landscape of LA. We can inject passion, play, and participation into education just by creatively utilizing the tools and social networking skills already in existence. We can build ways for students to want to share ideas, discover new subjects, and learn about different areas of expertise. We can facilitate ways for the larger Los Angeles community to participate in public education, by sharing expertise and supporting teachers and by rewarding project-based competitions. With MyARC, we take action to change the present state of education. By building a virtual network that will serve LA’s real network of students, schools, and communities, we seek to facilitate to improve the educational futures of LA youth and, along with them, LA’s future as well."

Using the LA Forum’s online city generator game, S(t)imulate LA, you can make planning decisions, set zoning policy, and create regulatory incentives to set Los Angeles on a path toward fulfilling your vision in the next 37 years. What many residents of LA don’t realize is that the City’s planning policies restrict a lot of development and have at times resulted in challenging the implementation of ideas that would make LA a more sustainable, connected, innovative, and fun place to live. Planning decisions have a direct impact on our open space, air quality, and water supply and quality. By manipulating the City of LA’s current planning and building policies, we can generate an alternate city that could be healthier, happier, and wiser, all while accommodating the explosive population boom that we expect to continue in Southern California. This free website game, which we plan to jointly develop with 8-80 Cities, the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab, and software developer Esri, allows players to become the master planner for LA, toggling through a series of metrics that establish a basis for how the city could potentially develop. Once the metrics are defined, players push “go” and watch as the city transforms based on project population increases and climate changes over 37 years before coming to a rest at 2050. The resulting city that emerges from each player’s choices can be saved and shared with other players to form a larger on-line conversation about how we as LA residents can improve the city. At the end of six months of play, the LA Forum will organize the best LA scenarios from the website into an interactive exhibit in our Hollywood gallery, where they will be shared with the general public, as well as reviewed by city planners, politicians, and members of LA’s urban design and architecture communities. We will host a series of discussions aimed at analyzing the game’s outcomes for potential influence on future planning in the city. The game’s outcomes are influenced by two sets of variables—baseline metrics and projections that can be dialed up or down and big ideas that have the potential to change the geography and morphology of Los Angeles. Examples of the metrics will include the following as a minimum, but we expect to create more as the game develops: (1) Access to transportation and commute length/time/type; (2) Access to green/open/recreation space; (3) Zoning districts (commercial, residential, industrial); (4) Density; (5) Environmental conditions (air quality, water quality, microclimates); (6) Demographic changes—population aging and immigration; (7) Opportunities for broadening the tax-base; Examples of big ideas could include: (1) High-speed rail; (2) Coastal redevelopment to combat global warming; (3) Habitat restoration; (4) LA River redevelopment; (5) Changing energy usage and generation; (6) Regionalizing air-travel; We hope the game will provide a platform for reconsidering the City of LA’s planning and building policies, informing a much-needed debate that will start as the City begins to internally revise its own policies throughout the coming years.",

The Quality of Life Center, Inc.'s mission is to develop and manage centers with multi-cultural programs and services designed to ensure that opportunities for success are equally shared by all participants with a desire to improve their quality of life. Through Art and Education we reach out to our youth and our communities. Quality of Life Center, Inc. programs mark a bold departure from traditional guidance programming. Through innovative instruction and individualized attention, youth travel a road to success that begins with believing in themselves and never giving up on the fact that success is yours for the taking. Though our programs somewhat defy the norm, they are now \"nationally acclaimed\" and have proven to be extremely successful in meeting the needs and providing youth an opportunity to prove to themselves that honesty and hard work can and will bring about positive life changes. Many of our youth programs address: youth who are dropping out of school, depressed, some with no sense of self worth, and others turning to the \"streets\" for love and understanding. Some are trapped in situations in which they have had no chance to follow their dream. \"If we don't help them, who will? Our nationally esteemed Bright Futures Scholars program participants are brilliant scholars with extremely high GPA&'s. Quality of Life Center programs are designed to assist the young, enabling them to become productive citizens, build self esteem, dream and then conquer their most \"impossible\" dream. Without programs such as the ones offered in the Quality of Life Center, Inc., one out of every three low-income minority students attending high school will drop-out before earning a diploma (2005 PUSD Statistic). Most will not be encouraged to return to school, nor offered pre-training to become marketable in corporate America. Many students, even young scholars, if coming from low-income families will not have an opportunity to reach their full potential and scores of juvenile first offenders will be placed in the justice system. Much of our programming depends on community support. We are proud to say that our programs are endorsed by community leaders who see the value in what is being accomplished to direct positive changes in the future of our communities. The National Education Association (NEA), as well as many surrounding school districts, plan to foster pilot programs using Quality of Life Center Inc. components in 2008. At the Quality of Life Center, we have an opportunity to service families with many different needs. We will strive not only to meet the needs but to eliminate the problems causing the need.

    "slug": "2013/smart-growth-for-all-affordable-housing-near-public-transit",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Public Counsel",
    "summary": "Imagine the Los Angeles of 2050. Will it still have traffic-choked freeways, ever-increasing pollution, and neighborhoods divided by lines of wealth and poverty? Or will it have smog-busting transit and bike lanes, playgrounds and parks, and housing that everyone can afford? Public Counsel is using its legal muscle to help create a future for LA that is greener, more prosperous, and more livable. For the past few years, we have been focusing on ensuring that plans for the city’s public transit system include affordable housing, so that low-income residents can benefit as public transit reshapes the regional landscape. With an unprecedented influx in transit investment taking place in LA, the key question facing our communities is: how can development happen so that everyone benefits, and nobody is left behind? Transit corridor and transit-oriented development (TOD) is an increasingly popular strategy to improve our built environment while reducing carbon emissions. Thanks to the passage of three critical pieces of legislation—Assembly Bill 32, Senate Bill 375, and LA County Measure R—TOD is becoming a reality in LA. City planners estimate that 80% of new development in the city will be transit-adjacent, and the Mayor has appointed a Transit Corridors Cabinet to plan for dense, walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods near transit. But with transit development comes both opportunity and risk, especially for existing low-income residents of transit areas. Mounting evidence shows that TOD can actually work against many of its stated goals, resulting in rising land value and housing costs, displacement of lower-income residents by higher-income residents with higher rates of vehicle ownership, and therefore—paradoxically—declining transit ridership. The need for affordable housing near transit is especially urgent in Los Angeles. LA is the most economically segregated metropolitan area in the country. Residents in the city’s existing station areas have median household incomes of less than $30,000 a year, significantly lower than the regional median. Nearly three-quarters of station area residents are renters and more vulnerable to displacement. Another reason for the urgency of equitable TOD in LA is the dissolution of California’s redevelopment agencies in 2012, which resulted in the loss of $64 million in annual economic development in LA alone. Public Counsel demonstrated the power of legal strategies to effect systemic change when it recently challenged the State’s attempt to take redevelopment funds targeted for affordable housing in eastern LA County. At a hearing, the judge asked Public Counsel’s pro bono attorney how losing such funding would cause immediate harm. The attorney provided sworn declarations showing, for example, that without funding for affordable housing, many families will be on the street or forced to remain in transitional shelters for a year or longer. One mother of three described how her family is packed into a single room where they have trouble sleeping, the kitchen is too small to cook an adequate meal, her 5-year-old daughter has to attend an unfamiliar school, and she lacks the permanent address she needs to find a job. At the end of the hearing, the judge granted a preliminary injunction protecting $38 million in affordable housing funds. Against the backdrop of this crisis in redevelopment funding, TOD is being touted as “Redevelopment 2.0.” But TOD can only help redevelop low-income neighborhoods to the benefit of existing residents if we put policies in place to make that happen, and ensure that those policies are effectively implemented. That’s where Public Counsel’s legal muscle comes in. Too often, resident and community voices are left out of major decisions affecting the build out of their neighborhoods. Too often, plans are made but not implemented. We have used our legal expertise in the past to ensure an open and accessible public process, and we have worked with our nonprofit clients to develop innovative policies that advance the interests of local residents. Building on our prior successes in South LA, the Cornfield Arroyo Seco specific plan area north of downtown, the 15 mile radius surrounding the City of Industry, and the southeast cities, Public Counsel will: (1) Advocate for the development and preservation of affordable housing and anti-displacement policies near transit; (2) Advance land use plans that represent the needs of vulnerable residents; and (3) Provide in-depth, one-on-one legal and policy assistance to nonprofit affordable housing developers, and to community-based organizations representing low-income residents, to help them participate in community planning processes. Working together, Public Counsel and our partners can ensure that transit-oriented development works for low-income communities, for the smart growth goals of the city, and for the environmental aspirations California shares with so many people throughout the world.",

Most of all, as Los Angeles develops its transit infrastructure, it will do so in a manner that allows it to retain its socio-economic, racial, and cultural diversity, and that does not push out existing communities and residents.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "For the past two years, Public Counsel has worked with the Southeast Asian Community Alliance to develop a groundbreaking new land use plan for the transit-rich Cornfields Arroyo area north of downtown.

As a result of our efforts in providing lead legal and policy support, along with the efforts of other community partners, the plan is expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The plan is being touted as a model for transit planning throughout LA.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "If we are successful in achieving our goals for equitable transit-oriented development in 2050, Los Angeles will preserve its stock of quality housing that is affordable for low-income residents, and will use the transit build out as an opportunity to build even more affordable housing. Public TOD planning processes will be transparent, and will include input from low-income community advocates at all stages. Most importantly, no person will live on the streets or in substandard or overcrowded conditions due to a lack of affordable housing, and no one will be displaced as a result of transit development. Existing residents will benefit along with new residents from equitable TOD."

    "summary": "For Learners of All Ages believes in developing innovative solutions to the challenges facing our community by cultivating collaborative lifelong learning. It was difficult to ultimately select the most relevant indicator for our organization's proposed projects. Though intersecting with education, social connectedness, we believe that through cultivating and enriching arts and cultural vitality these other pieces fall into place. The arts in public schools continue to suffer from budget cuts. With increased focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) in K-12 education, remaining funding is centered around related subjects. The arts, and in particular, dance, is being pushed aside as less relevant. For many students, it is the artistic, cultural, creative, and physical elements of the school day that keep them coming back and staying academically involved. At the same time, it is these same elements in our communities, city, state, and nation that draw people in and motivate them to invest themselves. For this reason, many students from the Northeast San Fernando Valley are bused to other parts of the Valley and City or to private schools where holistic education takes place. At the same time, this is the reason why Northeast Valley residents commute to Hollywood, Downtown, and Santa Monica to invest their recreation time. But change is in the air. To this end, our My LA 2050 idea is: 1) to implement an after school Bachata dance program in four high schools in the Northeast San Fernando Valley and at Los Angeles Mission College and 2) to create a dance festival based in the Northeast San Fernando Valley serving as a culminating event for our students, a major artistic/cultural community event, and a way of showcasing vital community resources, in this case the Boys and Girls Club of the San Fernando Valley.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In the year 2050 we expect to see a healthier, more vibrant, and community-minded constituency in our neighborhoods. We intend to see greater academic success in terms of both students and educational institutions. We are focused on project-based learning that is then applied back to the classroom, and we will see more and more education taking place within the community itself, not just confined to a campus or between the official school day. The arts are key to the growth of cultural identity and vivacity, and their growth will make our schools far more attractive to students and beneficial to their intellectual, physical, and emotional development. The success of our dance projects will help propel our other aspects, in particular music, forward as well as other niche interest areas that otherwise wouldn't exist. Among our youth there are future costume designers, set creators, program developers, film creators/producers, and on. Through what we are doing now, we will enable these niches to open and get exploited. For Learners of All Ages is committed to the entrepreneurial mentality, and we are going to instill it through diverse methods, including dance, music, and academic-supporting programming. We am witnessing a transformation in the education-community relationships ourselves, K-12 students. We are focused on the eventual melding of community and school campus, where youth and adults alike work together on project-based learning projects, where youth and adults alike share business interests, professional and personal pursuits, and community sustainability. These projects have already started, but by 2050 we expect this type of action to be the standard practice within the LAUSD and to have become a model template for communities across the county, state, nation, and globe. While we create all of this, we are documenting, as this is in many ways a research experiment. We anticipate studies to be published over the upcoming years. With all of this said, when it comes to dance, ultimately by 2050 we anticipate living in a world where it is a staple of our educational system and used as a way to integrate academic success, emotion-based learning, and community/activity-based service.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Success will be measured in a variety of ways:",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "For Learners of All Ages was incorporated 6 months ago. We received our 501c3 charitable status in February of this year.",

    "slug": "2013/los-angeles-promise-neighborhood-transforming-public-education",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Youth Policy Institute",
    "summary": "Promise Neighborhoods is President Obama’s signature education and poverty initiative to transform schools and communities into vibrant centers of excellence and opportunity. Based on the Harlem Children’s Zone model, the Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood (LAPN) led by the Youth Policy Institute (YPI) offers a blueprint for success in Los Angeles in 2050. YPI was awarded a $30 million Promise Neighborhood implementation grant in December 2012 by the U.S. Department of Education, one of only seven grants awarded nationwide. Los Angeles is the largest city in the US to be recognized with a Promise Neighborhood award. At the heart of the LAPN will be a cradle-to-career continuum of services in the communities of Hollywood and Pacoima. School transformation will be at the core of community transformation. The LAPN will be a zone of choice for families, with an array of high-quality traditional, charter, pilot, and partnership schools. The LAPN goal is to have young children entering school ready to learn, students achieving at high levels, and youth graduating from high school prepared for college and careers. Families will enjoy safe, connected neighborhoods with economic opportunities and clear pathways to success. How do we get there? By working together (LAPN has over 60 public and private partners) to break down silos and eliminate waste while getting the most from limited resources. The heart of LAPN is an innovative public-private partnership that blends diverse funding streams around a core set of outcomes and objectives that improve education while fighting poverty. LAPN is transforming 19 neighborhood schools in Hollywood and Pacoima into full-service community schools while opening six Promise Neighborhood Centers and dozens of satellite centers to support families. This is the educational model for Los Angeles in 2050. YPI has worked for over a decade building this continuum of cradle-through-college-and-career programs that link together to ensure that children and families access needed support. These efforts have been jumpstarted by the Promise Neighborhoods implementation grant awarded in 2012. YPI is ready to expand this continuum, which includes services like afterschool tutoring, early education programs, health and nutrition programs, college and career readiness workshops, job training, and public computer centers with access to broadband technology. LAPN serves Pacoima and Hollywood distressed neighborhoods with low performing schools, high rates of poverty, and low rates of educational attainment. Only 36% of LAPN students are at or above grade level in English Language Arts and 34% in math compared to 48% and 46% of LAUSD students. The LAPN graduation rate is 54% - much lower than the LAUSD graduation rate of 64%. YPI and LAPN commit to making major improvements on all five My LA2050 Education metrics, because school transformation and wraparound support that move the needle on all metrics is the only way LA can keep its promise to students for a high quality public education. LAPN transforms schools with parents, principals, and teachers through teacher professional development for effective and data-driven teaching and the use of Academic Coaches and Tutors at each school. YPI's Efforts-to-Outcomes longitudinal data system tracks student achievement and needs to evaluate best methods to help them learn. An Early Warning System identifies at-risk students based on grades, attendance, and other indicators associated with dropping out, and provide academic interventions to help students succeed. All 19 LAPN schools (both LAUSD and charter schools) become Full-Service Community Schools that offer youth and families wraparound services such as nutrition and wellness programs, ESL and GED classes, academic tutoring and enrichment, gang and drug prevention, digital literacy, college and career preparation, financial literacy, and referrals for other services. YPI has built a unique public-private partnership with the County and City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Unified School District, LA Area Chamber of Commerce, and community-based organizations that provides academic support, mentoring, digital literacy, college and career readiness programs, health and mental health services, wellness and physical activity, case management, financial literacy, among other programs. LAPN blends multiple funding streams in support of common objectives articulated in a shared Memorandum of Understanding. What does this mean? LAPN partners have committed to integrate services into the cradle-through-college-and-career continuum to achieve shared goals. By blending funding in this way, LAPN uses resources more efficiently, while simultaneously increasing the impact of each individual service. Partners also commit to sharing data in order to evaluate program impact. A new way to work together to help youth and families succeed. That’s the Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood.",

How will you measure success?": "YPI will evaluate the success of the Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood by tracking progress toward achieving performance outcomes for each metric (described in the previous section). Success comes from the improvement of schools in the neighborhood and the continued achievement of LAPN families, which provide the framework of success required to expand this model across Los Angeles by 2050.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "LAPN will transform low-performing schools into high achieving learning centers. The LAPN school transformation model can be replicated throughout the City so that all children have access to an excellent education that prepares them for college and careers. YPI has developed performance measures to track progress toward achieving goals that demonstrate specific and quantifiable ways that LAPN will benefit Los Angeles and make significant progress on the Education metrics within five years.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success in 2050 is a Los Angeles where all children start life with access to high quality health and early education services so they enter kindergarten ready to learn. It's a Los Angeles where all K-12 students achieve at or above grade level. It's a Los Angeles where 100% of students graduate from high school and enter the college or career of their choosing. It's a Los Angeles where all youth can participate in afterschool and summer enrichment programs to develop their creative and extracurricular interests. It's a Los Angeles that embraces the LAPN educational model to achieve these goals."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "UNITEDLAB",
    "summary": "Over the past few years, the City of Los Angeles has been making ardent, varied attempts at revitalizing its Downtown district. For instance, contemporary cultural nuclei such as The Disney Concert Hall, The Broad Museum have been generating much public interest. Furthermore redevelopment of neighborhoods and renewed events in the Artists’ district has stirred more awareness so as to cajole the vivacity of the City of Angeles. These attempts assert an indirect impetus at restraining the issue of land-use but do not solve the fundamental problem. As the incumbent urban sprawl deters mobility in Los Angeles, most commercial and recreational infrastructure has moved to suburban areas due to the availability of affordable, expansive land, and easy access. This in turn coerces Angelinos to use their personal motor vehicles to access downtown and its satellite facilities which is all the more prominent on weekends. The Central Business District (CBD) Decline Phenomenon is becoming graver, as the Downtown is strictly utilized for business and commerce affairs but lacks much recreational activity thereafter. Fundamentally, it forces deficiency in pedestrian activity, causes traffic congestion, increased demand for parking spaces, lack of urban parks and public space which are inherently interrelated. Los Angeles is also the city with the largest homeless population with settlements in the Skid Row district bordering downtown. Unfortunately, the temperate climate and lack of assistance for the homeless has contributed to this precipitous growth of the Skid row district. Our research is based on a futuristic vision for urban collective housing with emphasis on use in Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA). Through our research we hope to envision L.A.’s housing requirements for the future and develop new housing typologies to address these very requisites. New typologies for urban collective housing demand an exhaustive study of contextual downtown parameters such as urbanism, architecture, landscape, ecology, and social culture. This paradigm is beset by the predominant terse or perhaps lack of, use of the district in non-business hours. The research would work as a catalyst in arousing passion for the futuristic urban housing for the new era, far from the maximum units stacked prevalent woven into the fabric of the district.",
    "goal": null,
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Developing an affordable multi housing complex would contribute to revitalizing DTLA in various ways; provide housing opportunities for low income Angelinos, create work opportunities, give hope to skid row dwellers to find affordable housing, assist in restoring urban beauty, support pedestrian activity for downtown vibrancy, provide equal housing and equal opportunity by creating a homogenous community devoid of social class or ethnic schisms.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Predicting and evaluating the future of housing that positively influences the dynamism of a city should have an augmented forethought well beyond unscrambling present day challenges.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "In many instances, professional practice may have constraints that could be client driven or simply pertaining to ordinances and budgetary constraints. In my earnest efforts at overcoming such limitations by streamlining design operatives, I founded UNITEDLAB as a private practice in 2006. It strives to develop and refine said operatives by periodically participating in international competitions while engaging in theoretical and adaptive research. To that effect, chosen topics vary from architecture and landscape architecture to urban design and cross-disciplinary systems with locations in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Projects such as the Magok Waterfront and Busan River City are provocative urban scenarios which combine city planning with infrastructure, landscape, architecture, social policy, and development as urban expansion merges with green belts or farmland merges into cities. When working on these proposals it was important to understand that the city is not merely the sum of many objects but a kind of organism which relates to and is composed of those that are visible as well as numerous invisible variables. The Magok Waterfront Project was awarded by the American Institute of Architects (New York) and by the State of New York.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We understand that such definitive research needs rich collaboration between disciplines to envision a worthy future for the city. It beseeches urban planners, designers, engineers, landscape architects, ecosystem specialists, sustainability scientists and most importantly city dwellers to engage and develop operatives to derive new typologies.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "We feel that creating social housing typologies will create a more multi-dimensional transition between the different districts in DTLA. In present day context, there is a stark visible contrast demarcating various districts and this is all the more clear when it comes to the Skid Row and its surrounding streets. We have already seen how there is renewed interest in livening the use of space in downtown and we believe that our suggested research and its inference will generate more interest for pedestrian activity and use of spaces that will never be desolate at different times. The three dimensionality of such a project will invite dwellers to walk more, socialize more, take public transportation and actively engage with the community. Not declined by urban sprawl, public spaces, plazas, residential, businesses will all be more pedestrianized with interaction from people of all age groups, ethnicities devoid of social segregations. We feel that it will present a social reclamation of the two dimensional demarcation and inherent decline while generating close ties between elaborately interweaved DTLA districts building a strong sense of communities."

    "summary": "NativLA is a geo-location mobile app that will provide a YELP-like experience for users eager to explore our city’s wild side. Utilizing photography and video to unveil and document experiences with urban nature, users can share as well as search for experience by region, using categories such as “wildlife”, “seasonal” and “kid-friendly” as filters. As a social network, a place-based educational tool and an urban nature guide, NativLA will inspire environmental stewardship and foster a city-wide understanding of how nature sustains life. Los Angeles is the place without a sense of place, famous for sprawl and overdevelopment, and defined by its car-clogged freeways. It might seem inhospitable to efforts to connect with nature and community. But this city is rich in nature's amenities — the ocean, mountains, diverse habitats and eco-systems, with a Mediterranean climate. The City of Los Angeles has 15,710 acres of parkland, including 4,217 acres in Griffith Park, the largest municipal park in the United States. L.A. has nine lakes and an urban forest of one million trees. Approximately 70 community gardens are growing in Los Angeles County, serving 3,900 families and dozens of commercial urban farms are taking root within city limits. There are three core modes to the NativLA app: Spottings, Nativ Ambassadors and Location Based Field Guilds. Spottings are experiences with nature that can be shared and accessed by everyone. Snap a photograph or shoot video of a nature activity or wildlife sighting, select the appropriate category, confirm your location, add some descriptive tags or comments and submit it. In Upper Fryman Canyon, off Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills, a mother and her two sons record a chorus of frogs in the rain-swelled stream beneath a Eucalyptus grove. A torrent of comments follows, which identify the creatures as Southern Mountain Yellow-Legged Frogs, and claiming that February and March are the best viewing months. Further east in Hollywood’s Bronson Park, a guide from Urban Outdoor Skills photographs lush swaths of California sagebrush, mugwort and bay leaves, includes tips on how to gather and preserve them and provides a link to the organization. In Culver City, a father uploads video of his daughter “foraging” for guavas in the trees lining the Ralphs parking lot and, like a true Nativ, cautions her to pick only as much as she can carry. Nativ Ambassadors are urban farmers, homesteaders and environmental groups such as Los Feliz Eco Village and The Institute for Urban Ecology, who are willing to open their operations to Angelenos-at-large for the purpose of exploration and education. For example, an urban commercial farm in West LA, called Wybrandt Farm, uploads pictures of their 3,000 square foot vegetable garden, posts information about tours and provides a link to local farmer’s markets where they sell their produce. In Koreatown, The Los Angeles Eco-Village, designed to demonstrate lower environmental impact and higher quality of living in an urban environment, uploads video of their greywater and solar panel systems with a link to tours (lunch optional) and garden hours. The Location-based Field Guide is an opportunity to see what kind of eco adventures are occurring near you and learn more about them. Search through a map view, list view or grid view of recent Spottings and Ambassador posts all based on your location. You may also search through personalized Field Guides, rated by popularity, in which individuals or organizations have mapped out tours through specific neighborhoods or highlighted “best of” destinations. To aid in your search, you can filter by categories to find what you are most interested in. Categories include: Wildlife, Urban Farming, Foraging, Eco Adventures (adventures in sustainable alternative living i.e. art and design), Farmers’ Markets, Hikes & Walks, Kid-friendly and Seasonal. NativLA Field Trips: Los Angeles has experienced severe cuts in supplemental learning excursions from elementary through high school. Schools used to be able to take children on three district approved field trips per class, per year. Now budget cuts have forced the school to cut out field trips completely. Even the lure of free admission to a venue or experience isn’t enough – teachers have no way of providing transportation since the schools have to pay for the buses. NativLA Field Trips, a component of the Location-Based Field Guild, are built right into the application and web presence, and will allow teachers throughout Los Angeles to access information about free and accessible outings. Teachers will find many activities they can walk to right from school and there will be public transportation routes to NativLA Field Trips taking place across the city. According to the Center for Eco Literacy, place-based learning encourages students to experience the natural world and better understand the places where we live, work and learn.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Though NativLA does not yet exist, it will coalesce my years of experience with nature and the environment. While earning a BA in Journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I created the show Habitat for UNC-CH Cable TV on the abundance of nature found on campus. I spent summers interning at 60 Minutes, The New York Times and studying with the Wildlands Studies Program through San Francisco State University. My first job out of college was shadowing an environmental reporter at CBS affiliate WRAL-TV in Durham, NC where I put together a reel which landed me my first job reporting, at NBC affiliate KIEM-TV in Eureka, CA. As morning and then evening anchor, I wrote, produced and filmed dozens of stories on the local environment, including a three-part special on Coho salmon and their plight, and stories on the headwaters of the old growth coastal redwoods in Humboldt County. After moving to Los Angeles, I wrote and produced nature documentaries for television, including Earth’s Fury, Storm Warning and The Top 10 Environmental Disasters. When I chose to leave the workforce and start a family, I created my own company called Dutch Touch Art designing and commissioning a series of hand-painted oils for the design industry, based on the Netherland’s Golden Age and their iconic depictions of nature in the wild. Currently, I am Chair of a non-profit organization called Friends of Wonderland, which raises over $450K annually for Wonderland Elementary School in Laurel Canyon. We provide the enrichment programs that Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) no longer funds, including PE, library, music and art. We also ask, where field trips are concerned, that the parents carpool and pay for all admission fees.",

Our partner schools focus on the IQ: the reading, writing and arithmetic. We focus on the EQ: the emotional and social skills they need to be successful and break the cycle of poverty. Built into our after-school and Saturday programming are elements that address barriers to success such as a lack of parental involvement and support at home, the disconnect between the relevance of schoolwork to ‘the real world’, negative peer pressure, lack of positive role models and lack of confidence. By taking a more holistic approach to the needs of our teen girls we are succeeding in partnership with schools where schools alone are failing. Step Up’s proven programs directly impact high school completion and dropout rates, college going rates and after-school enrichment program participation. Our model is unique. Girls are introduced to many different mentors and role models, not just one. If a 9th grade girl is interested in becoming a doctor we can introduce her to one. By 10th grade she may be thinking she wants to be a writer, a psychologist or a talk show host (or all three!). Step Up has that covered. Not only are we able to introduce our girls to the women who have the careers they are interested in, we introduce them to the companies as well. They get to experience what it is like to be on the inside. Providing a tangible, attainable vision for the future is a powerful tool keeping our girls in school and motivated to go to college. The professional women in our network are there all four years of high-school as classroom volunteers, hosts for field trips to their offices, providing internships and as mentors. Our group mentoring model enables busy professional women who cannot commit to long-term mentoring relationships to leverage their personal and professional resources on behalf of the girls in our community in an accessible way. This keeps the women, and their companies, engaged. 9th and 10th Grade Confidence Building Program 9th and 10th grade classes are taught after school, one-day per week. This curriculum offers 30 weeks of after-school programming per grade and is designed to offer girls a solid foundation in life skills that will build their confidence. Created by internationally renowned confidence expert, Jess Weiner, the curriculum is jam packed with confidence boosting activities that also ground the students in career and college prep. Rooted in a multi disciplinary approach of team work, creative self-expression, group exercises, and open dialogue - students use their real life experiences to explore issues of identity, action, vision, voice, and expression. The 9th grade class focuses on Identity, Relationships and Voice. The 10th grade class focuses on Vision, Action and Expression. 11th Grade Career and College Exploration: Pathways to Professions Pathways to Professions is Step Up’s program aimed at jumpstarting high school girls’ career-exploration by providing invaluable first-hand exposure to a variety of industries and strong professional female role models. Step Up takes girls on field trips to companies and collaborates with each host to create dynamic, meaningful activities for students such as tours, role-playing and panel discussions. The program aims to instill greater professional confidence in Step Up teens. We leverage the reach of our professional women members to secure field trips to companies in a variety of industries from tech to publishing to banking to entertainment. After the field trips, the girls are led through critical thinking exercises about what they’ve experienced with the help of our member-mentors. Students attend at least five field trips throughout the year and meet one Saturday per month. Saturday workshops cover multiple college preparation topics utilizing our professional women mentors. 12th Grade College and Career Preparation: Young Luminaries This program is aimed at supporting Step Up seniors as they apply to and make their transition to college. Utilizing a group mentoring model, mentees and mentors attend a workshop one Saturday per month. In the fall semester the program focuses on support through the college application process. In the spring semester the program focuses on preparing students for summer internships at Step Up member companies. Topics include resume writing, cover letters, professional etiquette, dressing for success, mock interviews and more. All students meeting Step Up’s internship criteria are matched with a company for a six week paid summer internship. These internships help girls from socio-economically disadvantaged communities level the playing field by building their resume and exposing them to powerful networks of professionals that can provide recommendations to college and references for job opportunities.",

Our idea for LA2050 would be an event we will refer to as PLAY. PLAY -would be a community sustainability, futurist, art, music, and cultural event will be held at LA Center Studios in downtown LA in the Fall of 2013. LA Center studios is an old oil company headquarters that was transformed into an eco-conscious movie studios. PLAY -is a free event to the Angeleno community and a chance to unite the diversity of our city through electronic dance music, art (digital visual, live art, and installations). Electronic dance music (edm) festivals already have one of the most diverse crowds for any musical genre. All musical artists and attendees of electronic music events are extremely creative and typically forward thinking. Electronic Music festivals are currently some of the biggest festivals in the world and the popularity of our music style is increasing exponentially amongst the youth here in the U.S. PLAY would be a showcase of Los Angeles's most talented and artistic individuals and thinkers. The idea would be to create art and discussion about the future in an interactive manner to inspire and spark further discussion and action through interactive \"play\". What we hope to create at PLAY is a chance to bridge the ages of our audience by creating an event that is inclusive of all age ranges within our musical genre which is comprised of numerous sub-genres. We want this to be an event that both parents and their kids would like to attend. We would hope to create something that could turn into a World's Fair or SXSW. LA deserves that. The first year would concentrate on people being at the studios and having the event concentrated in the Vortex Dome (where we do 3D visual mapping), the beaudry building, and the streets below. Overtime we see this event spilling into other areas of the the studio as well as downtown. PLAY will be an event for the future. A chance to talk openly about current events and future projections through panels but in a fun format.

Bresee proposes a full-service college prep program that systematically targets the entire 450-member student body of Central City Value High School (CCVHS), a local charter school. Every student will board Bresee’s newly renovated, 25-passenger College Bus, and spend a full day touring a local college. That’s just the beginning. Throughout the school year, every student will have the opportunity to take their college dreams a step further by enrolling in: •\tA-G requirement workshops for 9th grade •\tPSAT classes for 10th grade •\tPSAT and SAT prep, remedial CAHSEE prep and personal statement workshops for 11th grade •\tSAT prep, scholarship boot camps, FAFSA completion, and the opportunity to apply for a needs-based College Bus scholarship for the 12th grade Programs will be available on the school’s campus, for free, to all students. This is a pilot program that is scalable and can be replicated at other schools in our community.

By piloting a scalable and replicable model, the impact of Bresee’s College Bus will not only be felt in our corner of the city, but eventually across LA. After successfully implementing this program at CCVHS, the model may be replicated by Bresee at any of the 10 high schools (with almost 11,000 students total) in a three-mile radius of Bresee. This would allow us to progress towards a day when all of the high school students in the Rampart area have been exposed to college and are college-ready.

The program would have spread throughout LA and be on the road to becoming a national best practice in college prep. The College Bus program would have raised a large scholarship endowment, to continue providing needs-based scholarships to students in LA.

In 2012, CCVHS’ graduation rate was 83%. Only 38% of graduates went to a 4-year college and 52% completedThe the A-G Requirements. With one college counselor, CCVHS is not equipped to provide college prep for all students. Given CCVHS’ record of academic gains, the College Bus is the ideal intervention to help CCVHS progress towards its goal of 75% of students going to college (CCVHS, November 2012)."

    "summary": "Homeboy Industries began when a concerned group of Angelenos, led by Father Gregory Boyle, asked a simple question: Can we improve the safety and health of our communities through jobs and education rather than through suppression and incarceration? In our 25 years providing services to Angelenos impacted by gang violence, we have learned that jobs, education and support services can indeed have a direct – and profound – impact on public safety. We have also learned that the success of our program corresponds directly with our ability to address the root causes of violence, alienation, and fear among communities and community members who are unsafe.\n\nIn this program, we propose to improve public safety through an integrated curriculum of ten classes that help end the intergenerational cycles of violence that many former gang members and recently incarcerated men and women have experienced. The classes and support groups we offer foster the personal transformation necessary for our clients to heal from their complex traumatic histories and prevent their children, families and communities from experiencing similar trauma.\n\n400 individuals attend classes each month at Homeboy Industries’ headquarters. Classes in the curriculum are led by Homeboy Industries staff, licensed mental health clinicians, and qualified volunteers. The core classes impacting public safety include:\n1) Anger Management: Provides our population with tools to develop healthy coping skills, build healthy relationships, and deal with conflict in non-violent ways.\n2) Parenting: Provides parents, particularly young parents, with the skills and techniques to improve their relationships with their children and end the cycles of violence, abuse and neglect they may have experienced in their own childhood.\n3) Project Fatherhood: Provides fathers an opportunity to connect with their children, play a meaningful role in their lives, and positively affect their children’s healthy development.\n4) Baby & Me: A weekly meeting for parents and their young children that provides activities to strengthen secure attachment, increase parents’ empathy for and understanding of their children’s needs, and decrease the likelihood of abuse or neglect.\n5) Leadership: A weekly class that helps participants build leadership skills, and discusses related topics of resiliency, forgiveness, character-building, loss, and separation.\n6) Healthy Relationships for Women: A weekly class that helps women who have been victims of domestic and/or sexual violence develop healthy and safe relationship expectations and practices.\n7) Domestic Violence Intervention for Women: A weekly group meeting that addresses domestic violence, helping batterers gain the tools and self-empowerment necessary to stop family violence and develop positive coping skills.\n8) Domestic Violence Intervention for Men: A court-approved program for male batterers that teaches life skills to build healthy coping mechanisms and healthy relationships, and to encourage men to take responsibility for their acts of violence.\n9) Healing Circle: A weekly meeting that provides space for reflection, empowerment, and respect while peers embrace the struggles in their lives and help each other find meaning in their past.\n10) Substance Abuse: A 3-phase course offering bi-weekly group support meetings, these classes help clients establish and maintain long-term recovery from the addictions that often influence their involvement with gangs and crime.\n\nClasses are available to trainees (men and women who are employed by Homeboy Industries in entry-level positions either at our organizational headquarters or in our social enterprise businesses) and to community clients (people impacted by gang violence, poverty and other issues who are not currently employed by Homeboy Industries).\n\nThe classes we offer complement the variety of other proven strategies we use to prevent violence and improve public safety. Homeboy Industries employs 200 trainees at all times (approximately 300 are employed throughout the year) at our organizational headquarters and our social enterprise businesses. As part of the job, trainees also:\n• Attend practical, educational and vocational classes to earn high school degrees or GEDs and improve their employment readiness;\n• Receive mental health and substance abuse treatment to address the underlying causes of their interactions with law enforcement and the criminal justice system;\n• Undergo tattoo removal procedures to eliminate the external marks of their former involvement with gangs;\n• Work individually with case managers and employment counselors to establish an educational and employment plan and transition successfully to outside work;\n• Access much needed medical services.\n\nAll services are provided free of charge, and most are available to trainees and to community clients.",

    "organization": "U.S. VETS - Los Angeles",
    "summary": "Ending homelessness among veterans has been the goal of U.S. VETS since its inception. Housing is the key to achieving success in the most basic needs of life. Without stable housing it is nearly impossible to maintain employment, family relationships, health and connection to society. U.S. VETS-Los Angeles has been on the forefront of serving homeless veterans in Los Angeles since 1993. The site opened a new permanent housing building in December 2011 increasing the number of affordable housing veteran beds available at the site to 660. Although the numbers have dropped significantly in the past 20 years, Los Angeles still remains the number one city for homeless veterans with between 6,300-8,000 veterans living on the streets—more than any other American city. Veterans represent a disproportionally high percentage of the Los Angeles homeless population at 20%. With the Obama administration’s announcement of its goal to end veteran homelessness by 2015 there has been a deliberate shift away from transitional programs that help homeless veterans address their issues and prepare them to re-enter the workforce and regain their economic independence. The current model of Housing-First favors putting homeless veterans into permanent housing and then providing mental health and addiction treatment. Not surprisingly, the prospect of permanent housing is very appealing to homeless veterans, especially if they are told that they can continue to use drugs and not risk losing their housing. In support of the Housing-First model, the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) issued VA Supported Housing (VASH) vouchers for veteran to pay for the permanent housing. The VASH program quickly ran out of vouchers and the system was overwhelmed by more applicants than available funds. Even those who were approved ended up waiting for months for a VASH case worker to process their paperwork and approve the apartment. Once housed, most veterans had little to no follow up from the overworked VASH case workers. By the VA measurements, the program is a success because veterans are off the streets and in permanent housing. However, as a program that has the benefit of observing the transitioning veterans to our adjacent building, it has become quickly apparent to U.S. VETS that many of these veterans are not equipped to maintain their housing and thus enter back into the cycle of crisis and homelessness. Housing retention is the missing piece from the VA’s push to embrace the Housing-First model. Although that model includes case management to assist veterans after the move into permanent housing, the reality is that the local VA has exhausted its allocation for staffing and funding to serve the high number of veterans in need and are encouraging veterans to seek assistance from other community agencies. Our proposed LA2050 program will provide the wrap-around case management necessary to increase veteran housing retention rates. As operators of a transitional housing program that is actively working to meet a 65% transition rate to permanent housing, U.S. VETS-Los Angeles will already have established relationships with veterans moving into community permanent housing. Additionally, the U.S. VETS-Los Angeles outreach team connects with 1800-2000 veterans annually and makes referrals for housing and other services. The Veteran Housing Retention program will employ a Housing Retention Specialist who will follow up with recently transitioned veterans via personal visits and phone calls to make sure that they are maintaining their homes, budgeting their money, paying their rent/utilities on time, managing their health/mental health issues with the VA medical center. The income assistance provided by the VASH program was a successful motivation for homeless veterans to seek permanent housing. The U.S. VETS Housing Retention program will also offer a financial incentive in the form of tenant based assistance for security deposits, utilities and emergency supplies.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "10,000+ veterans served since we opened our doors in 1993.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Our Housing Retention Program will directly benefit 55 veterans and their families with helping them attain and maintain permanent housing. The program will provide up to $1,125 in tenant based rental/utility assistance. Additionally, these veterans will benefit from the continued clinical case management services and ability to address developing issues before they reach crisis mode. Los Angeles’ high rate of homeless veterans will be decreased by the addition of this program, and the rate of housing retention will increase. Some of the populations most at risk that U.S. VETS assists is veterans with mental health issues and histories of incarceration. In both populations, access to community support services has been proven to decrease the incidence episodes of care in hospitals and recidivism among the parolee population. Reducing emergency hospital episodes and lock up time saves the city and State tremendous amounts of funding that can be directed at other citizens.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "No More Homeless Vets - period!",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The Veteran Housing Retention program will work with the VA, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation, Employment & Education Department, California State Parole, HealthRight360.

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Lybba",
    "summary": "Placing patients at the center of care: OPENHealth Central Obamacare is increasing the number of people with access to health insurance in Los Angeles, but that won’t automatically translate into better care. LA's healthcare systems serve more people than anywhere else. However, given the geographic, economic, and social disparities in the county, meeting the needs of the newly insured is a huge challenge. Making matters more difficult, no software service exists that is designed specially to assist primary-care teams in managing their most complex cases. Fortunately, these challenges offer an opportunity to create an innovative system and forge new partnerships that can improve care for everyone in Los Angeles and serve as an example for the entire country. Taking advantage of this opportunity will be easier with the open-source software service that we call OPENHealth Central, whose purpose is to put the 'care' back into the healthcare system. OPENHealth Central helps doctors and patients plan for visits more effectively, track experiences between visits, boost the quality of care and self-care, and provide the psychological support that comes from a rich human feedback loop. The system does this by triggering action on the part of doctors, while collecting data that drives evidence-based improvement in patient care, population health, and healthcare costs. OPENHealth Central provides patients with effective ways to organize and use their healthcare information in order to be more active participants in their own care. Beyond helping people make and prepare for medical appointments, keep track of prescriptions, and decode lab results, OPENHealth Central also encourages people to set and reach health goals through tailored care plans that offer both medical and lifestyle suggestions. Engaged patients make healthier choices, which means a healthier population—and reduced healthcare costs—overall. LA's healthcare challenges require a systematic response The newly insured have significant health needs and social circumstances that make it difficult for them to take full advantage of healthcare services. Meanwhile, this population is often treated at clinics that are already tending to those living in under-served communities where caseloads are high, funding is minimal, and compensation is restricted to face-to-face services only. A shortage of primary-care doctors in these communities already makes it more difficult to help people achieve optimal health. Fortunately, physician-led inter-disciplinary \"care team\" models are emerging to address this shortage while improving care. And yet there is no integrated software service that will help with this transition to a more efficient and effective care model. Placing patient needs at the center of healthcare Los Angeles can bridge the gap between insurance reform and healthcare reform in a systematic and innovative fashion by supporting OPENHealth Central, a web- and mobile-based system that helps clinical care teams better manage the health needs of patients with complex and costly chronic illnesses. When operational, OPENHealth Central will help clinical care teams: •\tscreen, assess, and coordinate the care of patients whose complex health problems and social situations pose barriers to timely and economical care •\tcommunicate with and monitor the health of patients remotely, in order to improve data quality while saving on time and expense associated with face-to-face clinical encounters •\tsupport individualized preventive/chronic/acute wellness planning to keep people out of the hospital whenever possible •\tdevelop a primary care model of continuous personal relationships that are data-driven and accountable; doing so will help ensure that clinical quality data can be more easily shared within medical practices and across hospitals and clinics, to improve the overall quality of care of Angelenos •\tincrease patient access to healthcare and community assistance programs, facilitating 'warm hand-offs' to people in agencies who can help the patient with their health-related needs OPENHealth Central will help Angelenos and their care-providers lead more healthy and satisfying lives regardless of their social advantages.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "By 2050 the Los Angeles healthcare system can orient itself around the needs of the vast number of people who are currently ill-served by the current system. This will happen because we will have used our know-how, passion, and community assets to create resilient peer networks that are focused on outcomes for all residents, not just those with the most luxurious insurance policies.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The personal, community, and healthcare costs associated with treating chronic illness are crippling Los Angeles; the costs associated with not treating such cases are even greater. The influx of newly insured people in Los Angeles is taxing an already burdened system, because a significant number of these families have serious untreated illnesses and challenging social barriers to negotiate. Many new strategies must be adopted now if we are to make headway by 2050.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "OPENHealth Central is being designed by Lybba, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in Los Angeles that design networks, tools, and events that help people better care for themselves and one another.

    "summary": "Creative Capital LA: a campaign for a healthy and prosperous Los Angeles County. Creative Capital LA is a public campaign to leverage the public investment in arts and culture to produce a successful and thriving Los Angeles County. With more and more research (LA2050, Otis Report, LA Stage Alliance’s Arts Census) showing that a robust arts & culture core reaps advances in education, business, and civic life, we are committed to supporting a future in which arts & culture are an essential part of the solution to building America’s Creative Capital – this year, and every year, to 2050 and beyond. Los Angeles has long been a beacon for big thinkers, dreamers, and innovators. We are the home of the second largest community of artists in the United States, the center of the film and music industries, the home for 5,000 fashion firms, and the epicenter of a creative movement building “Silicon Beach” alongside a vibrant core of creative small businesses. Now, all of us—educators, artists, lawmakers, business owners, creative workers, and arts lovers can unite under a single banner tailored for our individual neighborhood, community, or city, one that pulls us all together to complete the unique mosaic of creativity that is Los Angeles County. To launch Creative Capital LA, Arts for LA proposes a public engagement campaign to identify and celebrate the ways “Creative Capital” defines Los Angeles County. For the campaign, Creative Capital can be understood as a noun: a person, place, or thing. •\tCREATIVE CAPITAL is a person who creates or innovates. •\tCREATIVE CAPITAL is a place that nurtures creativity, fosters innovation, and embraces the imagination. •\tCREATIVE CAPITAL is a thing that enables creation or innovation (technology, infrastructure, materials like paint or musical instruments, public policies). Creative Capital LA will provide online tools and materials for individuals and groups to actively engage with each other, with their own communities, and with the 10 million residents of Los Angeles County. We will ask people to submit images (or videos) of people, places, and things with one of three captions: “I Am Creative Capital”; “We Are Creative Capital”; and “Los Angeles is Creative Capital.” The range of possible images will reflect the diversity and creativity of Los Angeles: a child learning to play a violin, a class of middle school students working on a mural at their school, church choirs, dance groups, an architect in front of Disney Hall, book festivals, film crews, a fashion show by emerging designers, and so on. The collection of images will translate the concept of “Creative Capital” into a visual representation that will instill pride, inspiration, and social connection among those who call Los Angeles County home. The impact of this campaign on the indicator of Arts & Culture Vitality will be both personal and collective. Those who participate in Creative Capital LA will be engaged to express their commitment to and participation in arts and culture, and those who view these expressions will, in turn, be inspired and possibly motivated to engage themselves in the arts. Collectively, Los Angeles will generate an atmosphere to strengthen our arts & culture ecology and will signal to the rest of the country, and the world, how an abundance of creativity and innovation can produce a successful and thriving city.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Brain Tumor/Neuro-Oncology Clinic at the LAC+USC Medical Center",
    "summary": "Being diagnosed with a brain tumor is a life-changing and potentially harrowing experience that greatly affects patients and families alike. The treatment of brain tumors is inherently complex, and requires streamlined management by a variety of healthcare practitioners (physicians, nurses, rehabilitation specialists, social workers, hospice workers, etc.) Patients diagnosed with brain tumors are often young and otherwise healthy and productive members of society that may suddenly transition to requiring frequent and chronic care, resulting in reduced workforce participation and mandating a variety of additional support services. The physical, financial, and emotional burdens on patients diagnosed with brain cancer, as well as their families, are further exacerbated when they are constrained by complex socioeconomic factors. Numerous studies have identified significant healthcare disparities with regard to access to care and treatment outcomes in brain tumor patients with lower socioeconomic or minority status, less education, and no insurance (Curry WT, Neurosurgery, 2010 and Mukherjee D, J Clin Neurosci, 2013). For brain tumor patients with such disadvantages, following complex treatment regimens (such as chemotherapy, daily radiation therapy, or clinical trials) and navigating a complex healthcare system composed of fragmented clinics and/or hospitals or non-native languages can be especially disheartening. These factors, coupled with the neurological deficits often caused by these tumors (such as paralysis or language/memory deficits) makes adherence to complex medical regimens even more of a struggle. It is therefore no surprise that many patients with socioeconomic disadvantages receiving brain tumor care have a difficult time making all their appointments (often several per week), or adhering to physician recommendations, sometimes resulting in delays in time-sensitive care. The LA County+USC Medical Center is the largest public hospital in Southern California, serving as a safety net institution and providing quality healthcare to millions of underserved and indigent Angelenos and other U.S. and world citizens. In January 2013, a group of Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Keck School of Medicine of USC physicians decided to form a multidisciplinary Brain Tumor/ Neuro-Oncology Clinic at LAC+USC in an attempt to streamline care for patients with complex primary brain tumors being treated at all LA County facilities. The weekly LAC+USC Brain Tumor Clinic staffed by these physicians receives patient referrals from any LA County-DHS sites AND OTHER LA HOSPITALS, thus serving as the ONLY centralized multidisciplinary Neuro-Oncology clinic for LA county residents. Patients have access to neurologists, neuro-oncologists, neurosurgeons, and radiation-oncologists during the SAME clinic visit, allowing the panel of physicians to discuss best-practice treatment options as a team, rather than fragmenting this care over several visits and potentially weeks or months. Furthermore, the clinic allows ALL patients to access the same therapeutic clinical trials as first-rate private academic institutions and cancer centers, which is a factor that has independently been associated with prolonged survival in patients with brain cancer (Shahar T, J Clin Neurosci, 2012). Although the Brain Tumor Clinic at LAC+USC was designed to accommodate a maximum of 12 patients per day, it is already overbooked to 15-18 patients per clinic for the next 3 months, demonstrating the dire need for this integral service in LA County. Our primary aim is to develop a world-class multi-disciplinary Brain Tumor/Neuro-Oncology Center of Excellence that will provide all LA County patients, regardless of insurance status, race, or education level with the same access to quality care for years to come. The development of a formal program at LAC+USC will ensure that this service is centralized at the County’s primary safety-net institution for decades. Support from the LA2050 grant will be used to develop a LA County Neuro-Oncology Center of Excellence, support a clinical nursing navigator/coordinator, manage a prospective patient database, create a program website and referral system, and provide seed money for researching brain tumor genomics and healthcare disparities in patients with brain tumors. By 2050, the potential for healthcare delivery in complex medical problems such as brain tumors to become even more disparate is a sad but sobering reality. Most indigent LA County patients with brain tumors do not have the luxury of visiting several practitioners or “shopping around” for their care. The potential to establish a Brain Tumor Center of Excellence embedded in our County’s largest public medical center is likely to at least partially offset this disparity, and help ensure that all patients with brain tumors in LA have access to the same basic care, clinical trials, and rapidly-evolving therapies.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The multidisciplinary Neuro-Oncology program at LAC+USC is one of the few in all of Southern California to provide multidisciplinary care to complex brain tumor patients, and the only designated Los Angeles County facility to do the same. The establishment of this clinic has streamlined care for chronically ill patients with brain cancer, and the demands placed on accommodating patients within this clinic highlights the need for this integral service to the population of LA County as a whole. Over the past decade, we have treated thousands of patients with complex benign and malignant brain and spine tumors using various combinations of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and have always strived to maintain the highest comparable standards with regard to quality of care as we have done for patients at our affiliated USC Norris Cancer Center (one of three National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Centers in Southern California). Perhaps most importantly, we have maintained an open door policy in treating all-comer patients with brain cancer referred from dozens of hospitals all over Southern California, and have never turned a patient with the diagnosis of a brain tumor away based on insurance or socioeconomic status. We have enrolled hundreds of patients in some of the latest and most promising clinical trials available worldwide. Our program has been the major site of the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, and chronicles information on all new cancer cases in LA County (approximately 30,000 patients per year). The LA County Cancer Surveillance Program is now the largest contributing registry to the NCI-funded Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Many of our Brain Tumor Center physicians are internationally recognized for their contributions to patient care and clinical-translational research, and have won numerous awards in recognition of their research contributions. Finally, clinician-scientists in our group have published numerous peer-reviewed research articles pertaining to novel treatments for brain tumors (such as inhaled therapies and vaccine trials), healthcare disparities and trends relating to brain tumors, and brain tumor genomics studies.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "This project will benefit Los Angeles in several ways. First and foremost, it will improve direct care to the thousands of Angelenos who already have existing benign and malignant brain tumors by developing the multidisciplinary Neuro-Oncology program at LAC+USC. LAC+USC Medical Center is one of the busiest public hospitals in the western United States and the largest single provider of health care in Los Angeles County. LAC+USC records nearly 39,000 inpatient discharges, 150,000 emergency department visits, and 1 million ambulatory care visits each year. Secondly, it will help ensure that all residents of LA County have future access to a specialized Neuro-Oncology care, physicians, clinical trials, and emerging therapies for years to come, so that care provided to LAC+USC patients is on par with any National Cancer Center. When new therapies for brain cancer do emerge, having the infrastructure in place to efficiently deliver care to patients with brain cancer will be critical; The proposed clinic will help with streamlined care delivery. Thirdly, it will help develop a Center of Excellence in LA County for many years to come, serving as a structural model and network for additional specialty centers to develop. Finally, research that emerges from this program may have indirect benefits for LA residents with brain tumors for years to come. Although complete elimination of healthcare disparities in Los Angeles by 2050 is a daunting task, we aim to serve as a model program for how a group of practitioners/providers with converging goals for patients can be a Center of Excellence despite limited resources, and reduce healthcare disparities within our treatment focus area.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The specific aims of the project are to: 1) Develop a centralized, multidisciplinary center of excellence for brain tumor patients throughout Southern California at LAC+USC Medical Center, 2) Accommodate the increasing number of patient referrals to this program, 3) Increase clinical trial enrollment for patients with brain tumors, 4) Increase research output from this program.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "True success regarding health in malignant brain tumors will mean finding a CURE for this disease by 2050. This can only be achieved through high-quality RESEARCH AND CLINICAL STUDIES. In addition, finding risk factors for brain tumors (such as genes, environmental factors, social factors, etc.) may help in preventing brain cancer or identifying individuals who are at particular risk for developing these tumors, and thereby increasing surveillance and providing earlier treatment.",

    "summary": "BLOOM is a bold initiative of the California Community Foundation (CCF). BLOOM seeks to support Black male youth (14 – 18 years old) who have been involved with the L.A. County probation system. By 2017, BLOOM will serve 2,000 of these youth with a specific focus on steering them away from the justice system and helping them complete high school, enter post-secondary education and earn taxable income. The end game is simple: school completion and jobs! BLOOM represents a landmark as the ONLY major philanthropic initiative in the country focused on Black male youth involved in the juvenile delinquency system. BLOOM seeks to have a minimum of 60% of youth served complete high school and pursue post-secondary education/training. This projected outcome is considerably higher than the current rate of 25% (high school completion) for probation-involved youth. Additionally, our expectation is that as more youth complete high school, more of them will be prepared to obtain meaningful employment and earn taxable income. To accomplish this, CCF intends to open avenues of access to educational and employment opportunities for 14-18 year old Black males, real and immediate opportunities such as academic support, scholarships, internships and jobs. BLOOM targets Black male youth who have been on probation because this is arguably the most vulnerable of any sub-group in Los Angeles County. The statistics reveal a grim reality: • Black youth make up a disproportionate percentage of youth on probation and in prison. Specifically, while they represent 10 percent of the county’s youth population, they comprise 33 percent of all youth under probation supervision; • In general, only 25% of youth on probation graduate from high school; • It is projected that one in four Black males will be involved with the criminal justice system in their lifetime, while only one in 10 will graduate from a four-year college; • It is estimated that for each cohort of 120,000 young adults each year that become part of the population that will never complete high school, they will cost California $46.4 billion in total economic losses over their lifetimes; and • In general, 45% percent of Blacks in Los Angeles County are either unemployed or not in the labor force, the highest among any racial/ethnic subgroup in the area. BLOOM invests in promoting Educational and Job Opportunity for youth in three ways: (1) academic/vocational advancement; (2) creation of a jobs pipeline; and (3) career-based mentoring. Investments are made through sub-grants to local nonprofit organizations serving this population, and in partnership with other nonprofits, foundations, corporations, and concerned individuals. Through these grants, nonprofit organizations and the local business community make an intentional, concentrated effort to reshape the trajectory of these youth by supporting them complete school, getting them job ready and ultimately placed in jobs. BLOOM provides the support and direction organizations need to embark on such efforts. Often times, efforts to support young Black men and boys are pursued one of two ways: (1) within a general framework to serve people of color in general or (2) under the auspices of a specific issue area (e.g., education). However, the wide disparities that persist in outcomes for Black male youth signal a need to take on a more concerted, focused effort. BLOOM is poised to demonstrate what a concentrated, intentional, and focused effort can achieve for young Black men.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "To measure the BLOOM’s impact, CCF enlisted an evaluation team from UCLA's Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities (CHCFC), a multidisciplinary research, policy and training institute with faculty from the UCLA Schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Public Affairs. The team has a combined record of more than 60 years of community-based evaluation, with clients including the Probation Department, Department of Children and Family Services and Homeboy Industries. The purpose of the evaluation is not only to assess the effectiveness and impact of BLOOM’s strategic investments but also identify any potential adjustments needed during the course of the five-year initiative. Short-term progress is based on a quarterly data collection and tracking process. This aggregated data will allow ongoing tracking of youth related to school enrollment, school achievement, job training/readiness, job placement and income. This data will be used in various ways to inform key stakeholders about BLOOM’s progress toward the long-term vision of school completion and jobs for Black male youth. Long-term progress will be tracked based on a set of specified outcomes and indicators. These outcomes include: (1) 60% of youth will complete high school, (2) 50% of youth 18 years and older will earn taxable income, and (3) 60% of youth will develop a sustained relationship with a health adult male role model. Throughout the five years, the UCLA evaluation team will produce an annual evaluation report and other reports as needed. Based on the findings, there could be strategic refinements, which in turn could result in revised metrics.",

The special event series would feature ten important and inspiring projects located across the east side of Los Angeles, where attendees will have the opportunity to learn from the designers, architects, and artists who completed and/or fostered these projects. The series will culminate in 2014 with the “Making LA Conference,” a one-day conference hosted on the east side of L.A., that features local creatives instructing attendees on the elusive act of implementation for socially focused design ideas. The “Making LA Conference” will also significantly highlight each of the creatives featured within the year-long “Making LA” event series, in addition to effectively educating hundreds of local creatives on how to move forward on their own projects for Los Angeles.\n\nThe “Making LA” programming series will consist of ten de LaB events that take place at significant sites across the east side of Los Angeles. These events will last anywhere from two to three hours and will feature a tour, talk, or workshop about the project by the designer, followed by questions and a reception. Attendees will get to hear first-hand from the designers and architects of these ten influential projects for Los Angeles, and begin to learn how such projects became reality. Each event will be free and open to the public.\n\nThe “Making LA” programming series will be based on the past success of de LaB’s regular programming activities. Since 2008, de LaB has hosted close to 100 events that encourage audiences to see Los Angeles in a new light. This series will be no different. Events may be modelled after past successful events, where attendees were encouraged to see and experience a new neighborhood or a new important architecturally significant building, or a temporary structure that promises to bring important aesthetic and urbanistic qualities to a largely underserved community. Examples might include tours of the restoration of iconic and historic hollywood buildings, such as the historic Hollywood Tower and the renovation of the Best Western Hollywood Hills, which shows how developers are working together to improve a city block.\n\nOther possible events could include a new twist on some of de LaB’s most popular annual events, including:\n-The City Listening forum, which invites local writers, designers, and design celebrities to perform readings on Los Angeles urbanism in front of an audience of over 200 people.\n-The annual Design-n-Dim Sum bike tours which has encouraged attendees to travel from Highland Park to Chinatown, visiting design and art studios along the way.\n-The annual PARK[ing] Day intervention, held in partnership with the restaurant Local, which features pocket parks created on Sunset Boulevard to raise awareness for the lack of green space in the neighborhood.\n-The Obscura Day tour, which visits the Tile House, an incredible architectural marvel designed by folk artist George Ehling and is not open to the public.\n\nThe “Making LA” conference, to be held in spring of 2014, will be attended by up to 500 local creatives and will focus on teaching the specifics of how to move from the idea to the implementation phase. Speakers will address issues ranging from funding to fabrication, with a focus on Los Angeles resources and support. Workshops will give hands-on experience and practical, real life advice.

    "summary": "ImPact Farms, has a plan to develop underutilized property and building rooftops in South Los Angeles into Hydroponic/ Aquaponic Urban Farms. These high tech soilless Urban farms are capable of producing 10 to 20 times more produce per sq. ft. as compared to traditional soil farms. The increased yield is the result of an extended growing season, controlled environment and growing in three dimension and are essential to supporting investment in Urban Farms. As a triple-bottom-line Social Enterprise, ImPact Farms replaces outsourced manufacturing with agricultural technology while directly and indirectly supporting a potential of 30 local permanent, family-supportive-wage jobs per acre. At ImPact Farms, we define family-supportive-wage as the income required to support three people as established by the city of Los Angeles and then add health and other benefits. As a matter of policy, base wages will be adjusted for inflation using the US Census Cost of Living Index. In addition employees are eligible to participate in a profit sharing pool committed at 20% of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). ImPact Farms founders are committed to converting profit sharing into 40% employee ownership within 15 years, using the latest models, definitions, and ideas for ownership transfer and classifications from the Sustainable Economies Law Group (SELC) in their policy group's public comment for the proposed Worker Cooperative Statute to be put into the CA Corporations Codes. Although it is in the drafting process, we have included this to show Impact Farms' commitment to creating fair and meaningful worker ownership. Los Angeles, benefits from keeping more of our “food dollar” circulating in the Local economy. Meeting Los Angeles nutritional requirements locally by 2050 could retain as much as $10 billion annually representing over 90,000 permanent local jobs. Even community groups will benefit from profit sharing at 10% of EBITDA for nutritional, education and to fulfill other group defined quality of life objectives. ImPact Farms is able to sell its organic, locally grown, fresh and therefore highly nutritive vegetables, fruit and fish at an affordable rate in South LA community and offer the above mentioned benefits by selling its produce at a premium price in wealthier neighborhoods and bringing revenue and income back into the inner city. Our one day harvest to table direct delivery to households will be specially helpful to single-parent families and those who have no or limited access to transportation, saving them time from shopping they can use the time to prepare fresh food and enjoy quality time with family members. For example, to further ease access to fresh food, ImPact Farms in cooperation with LAUSD will provide CSA produce and eventually meals at school sites for parents to pick up when they pick up their children. Our goal is to create jobs that allow the community to build wealth and equity that will help create a middle class in the poorest neighborhoods of Los Angeles as opposed to creating many minimum-wage jobs that barely raise people above the poverty line. A middle class strata has the economic power to impact the real estate economy through home purchase and improvement, leading to higher property and income taxes that benefit the city and higher buying power that will bring more economic movement to the ancillary and surrounding businesses.

    "organization": "Educating Young Minds",
    "summary": "Educating Young Minds, a non-profit learning center, is expanding the reach of its educational and counseling programs by undertaking a significant expansion of its pre-K programs and services. Through an innovative on-line program, Educating Young Minds is using its 25 years of experience to better serve the under-represented and at-risk population in Los Angeles. This on-line service will initially serve 2,500 students, allowing for a later expansion of up to 10,000 students. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EYM Educating Young Minds is a rich and diverse supplemental learning environment where students are encouraged to grow academically, emotionally and socially. Educating Young Minds grew out of the needs of many students and families for supplemental education and counseling, which over-stressed public schools could not meet. Mrs. Angeles Echols began Educating Young Minds, a non-profit learning center, 25 years ago in her one bedroom apartment in mid-city Los Angeles. She saw the need in our inner-city communities for supplemental educational and counseling services. A dysfunctional school district and unsupervised after school environments were, and still are, endangering young people and fueling unacceptable high school dropout rates. Through hard work, good business sense, and a deep understanding of humanity, Mrs. Echols built Educating Young Minds into a thriving community based organization that currently serves 277 students (pre-K through 12th grade) throughout the year with a staff of 25 teachers, 4 administrative staff, and 3 volunteers in a 12,000 sq. ft. state of the art learning center. Open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. , EYM provides home study instruction, after school tutorial (The Ray Charles / Educating Young Minds Enrichment and Learning Program), standardized test prep classes, a six week summer program, and a college scholarship program that offers EYM high school graduates $6,000 to $12,000 college scholarships. EYM has empowered over 3,500 students with the skills and ability to enroll in, succeed at, and graduate from four year universities. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM •\tACCESS / NO EXCUSE is an on-line tutorial program developed by Angeles Echols and Educating Young Minds collegiate graduates that provides students with a wide range of learning interactions from pre-K through college and beyond. The pre-K component is a comprehensive program that provides: 1.\tThe EYM On-line Curriculum provides sequential lessons in mathematics and literacy. These bi-lingual learning interactions combine visual and audio learning approaches. Learning interactions move at the rate of the child, custom tailored to his or her needs and ability. Parents go on-line with the child and are encouraged to take a lead role in interacting in positive, educational, and fun activities. Parents have the option to turn off the sound and follow a prepared script that enables them to become the teacher. The curriculum is geared to encourage positive interaction between the parent and child. The material starts with basic classification and association, phonics, and then progresses to introducing numbers and letters to jumpstart the child’s educational development so that he or she is prepared for elementary school. The site also incorporates an incentive for the students to continue to progress through the curriculum through the use of a point system. A site member earns points for passing quizzes and tests, and they can then use the points to interact within the virtual world. 2.\tVirtual World Interactions allow parents and students to choose the subject, be it math, English, or phonics, and within the virtual world, they can interact with other students during the learning process. Students and parents interact with on-line resources and a free-roaming, 3-D, interactive virtual world representation of the Educating Young Minds Learning Center. 3.\tEYM Live / On-line is a direct video conferencing feed that connects parents and students to teachers, counselors and mentors at EYM’s learning center. Parents will work directly with teachers to provide early education opportunities for their children. Available from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. of Fridays, EYM Live / On-line will serve families that cannot access area preschools. Parents on-line provides message boards for parents only, allowing them to interact with teachers, counselors, and each other. On-line communities can be excellent resources for support and information; Parents on-line provides a forum where parents can share their views, and reach out to others in the community. Using HTML5, this website is accessible on tablets, iPhones, and traditional desktops. ACCESS / NO EXCUSE is an on-line educational hub that has been built in large part by EYM alumni. These former students have graduated college and returned to EYM.",

This system of care enables students to miss fewer days of school, succeed in their academic careers, graduate on time and pursue successful futures. The LA Trust is the champion of a bold vision for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) developing a network of 14 School Wellness Centers that will improve student health and academic achievement. The Wellness Centers will each serve the students and families throughout its network of surrounding schools and community brining needed access to health care and prevention for at least 40,000 individuals at each center. The LA Trust is working tirelessly with its many partners to open 12 of the 14 centers by June 2013. In 2008 the school district and county Department of Public Health joined forces with The LA Trust, and other supporters to find solutions for our children and teens who were experiencing violence, obesity, poverty and sexually transmitted diseases. These harsh realities and poor health outcomes were impacting student achievement leading to higher dropout rates and school failure. This group of innovators recognized that success in school requires that students are healthy enough to learn, but far too many students have little or no access to the health care they need. School-based health clinics in the district have provided more than 200,000 health care visits annually to elementary, middle, and high school students. But, it is not enough. The bold vision for Wellness Centers moves beyond the traditional health care visit. The Wellness Centers are a one-stop shop, providing near universal access to care and information about healthy diet and exercise, diabetes prevention, mental health promotion, and oral health care. Care doesn’t end at the door of the Wellness Center, but expands throughout the school network to promote wellness for all students. The Wellness Center is not a place a student goes, but an experience students and their families have of being connected with essential preventive health care, health education, support programs, and health insurance coverage that create a healthy life at school and at home. Wellness Networks engage students and offer opportunities for students to promote positive health behaviors for themselves, other students and their community, thereby increasing their leadership skills, self-empowerment, and interest in a future health career. Wellness Networks also facilitate access for students to training and placement to pursue a health career pathway. The LA Trust is leading the charge in moving this vision forward, bringing the numerous stakeholders, sponsors, and experts to the table through the Wellness Network Learning Collaborative. It is this collaborative planning approach that ensures the success of the process by bringing LAUSD, federally qualified health centers, Public Health Department, and other partners together to negotiate the operational and programmatic details. The Wellness Centers will bring together all student programs within the district including mental health, pupil services, medical services, health education and nursing to build linkages and coordination to create a student-centered approach to prevention and wellness promotion. An unprecedented investment by the school district of $34 million has helped build the infrastructure, the bricks and mortar, for the Wellness Network. Federal grant funds have also been awarded to support the effort. But, the school district cannot do this alone. To realize the promise of the Wellness Network in Los Angeles, there has to be buy-in and investment of public and private partners throughout the county. The LA Trust has brought in some initial foundations to invest in the vision. However, additional support is needed to: (1) Engage communities, students and families in the collaborative planning process, (2) Get creative and expand the horizon of services and supports that the Wellness Centers offer, and (3) Build awareness among students and communities of the Wellness Centers and the services available. A grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation would support our efforts to develop and launch this innovative network of Wellness Centers that would redesign health care and prevention for a generation of youth and their families in Los Angeles.",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Every day more than 680,000 children attend school in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Many of our students have little or no access to essential preventive and primary health care. In some classrooms, one in three students are obese and are already on the path towards chronic health care conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. In some classrooms, one or two students will develop Type 2 diabetes before graduation and four teenage girls will contract a sexually transmitted infection. One in three young women in LA will have an unplanned pregnancy before their 20th birthday and many of them will drop out of school as a result.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The LA Trust plays a leadership role as the convener and strategic coordinator by facilitating the Wellness Network Learning Collaborative. This collaborative brings partners and stakeholders together to build and realize the vision on the ground. However, this would not be possible without the commitment of LAUSD. In addition, all of the Wellness Networks are sponsored and managed by a federally qualified health center and supported by dedicated school personnel. The LA Trust also works closely with the California School Health Centers Association, the Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County, the LA School Health Coalition, LA Health Action, the Children’s Partnership, the LA County Education Foundation and many others.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "One of the most significant achievements to date for The LA Trust has been the engagement of a broad cross-section of stakeholders to develop a strategic plan, which outlines the vision for the Wellness Networks. This considerable undertaking has built the foundation and buy-in across the many collaborators and partners.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success in the year 2050 would see a generation of county residents that are healthier than their parents and grandparents because they were raised with universal access to prevention and wellness promotion supports and programs that set them on the path for lifelong health. In 2050 the disparities in chronic disease and poor health outcomes between the wealthy and the poor would be nearly erased with the equitable access to health care and coverage fostered by the LAUSD Wellness Networks.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The LA Trust and our partners in the Wellness Networks recognize that there is an important and necessary role for local community stakeholders, particularly students, families and caregivers when employing a place-based and population-based approach. As part of the evaluation approach, Wellness Networks utilize students and community members in the data collection at the beginning planning stages and throughout implementation. Community members can map community assets, help set baseline measures for evaluation of key outcomes, and monitor progress on what matters most to students, families and communities."

    "organization": "Peace Over Violence",
    "summary": "We are committed to the Children's Program as a means to create an environment of safety and healing for children ages 3 and up who have witnessed or experienced sexual or domestic violence. The Children’s Program will use a variety of cutting edge therapeutic, cognitive and somatic methods that are based on research and evidenced based successes for children's mental health and well being (e.g., play/expressive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, support groups, etc.). The Center is distinguished by its primary focus on the engagement of children and youth and its secondary focus on those who care for them. POV will expand its mental health treatment services by establishing expert, clinical staff who will work with child witnesses and victims so that they can heal from the trauma they have experienced, increase levels of trust and support in their lives, and re-orient to a “new normal” of violence free lives. This work will impact the public safety indicator by disrupting intergenerational cycles of violence and the consequences of unaddressed trauma--agression, involvement in criminal activity, community and interpersonal violence, drug and alcohol abuse, risky sexual behaviors, and suicidal ideation. The Children's Program will be highlighted as an exceptional program within POV's Children and Youth Center. In September 2012, Peace Over Violence expanded its downtown Los Angeles headquarters by opening a Children and Youth Center. The Center currently houses POV's youth violence prevention programs, including POV's Youth Over Violence Summer Institute and Internship Program which trains 25 emerging leaders on understanding the roots of violence, media literacy education, and violence prevention strategies. Youth then participate in paid internships where they design social media apps for violence prevention, construct and implement community assessments on violence and design and strategize methods for peer involvement in violence prevention and building healthy relationships.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Peace Over Violence has been a leader in advocacy for victims of violence since the early 1970’s, when it established a rape crisis hotline, prevention training and advocacy for women who had been assaulted. In 1976, the organization expanded the hotline to include counseling for victims of domestic violence. Over the years, Peace Over Violence has evolved beyond one-on-one intervention in sexual assaults and domestic abuse, toward one-by-one prevention of youth violence and child abuse, serving over 22,000 individuals a year. A leader in advocacy for victims of violence, Peace Over Violence played a major role in the acknowledgement of rape, battering, and stalking as crimes, changes to criminal procedure to respect the rights of victims, the development of anti-violence policies and curricula, and the training of emergency room and other medical personnel to recognize and intervene in cases of domestic violence and rape. POV’s national Denim Day in LA & USA sexual violence prevention education campaign registered over 5 million participants in 2012, in all 50 states and in 117 foreign countries.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "LIFT - Los Angeles",
    "summary": "LIFT believes that all people, regardless of socio-economic status, need the following three-dimensional supports to overcome poverty’s cycle of crisis and move ahead in life: economic resources (money in our pocket); internal capabilities (self-confidence, problem solving skills ); strong community networks (people in our corner). When clients come to LIFT-LA for support (to secure housing, food security, employment, educational opportunities) they are immediately connected with a trained volunteer advocate who partners with them to navigate through the complex social service delivery systems and map to economic security. LIFT-LA’s premise is that 1) we all have shaky ground moments, regardless of income, and deserve the same types of support in times of crisis— dignified and caring support; 2) constituent voice is needed to devise systems and allocate funds that will effectively move people out of the cycle of poverty; and 3) an empathetic response unleashes potential for both individual and institutional change. To turn up the volume on constituent voice to debunk the myths of poverty and erect more sound policy, our big idea is to bring the constituent voice to the forefront of informing and reforming the way we address poverty in LA. Myth: Poor people do not have a voice. Author and activist, Arundhati Roy states that \"there is no such thing as the voiceless. There are the deliberately silenced, or the preferably unheard.\" There is much that nonprofits can learn from the for profit sector about the benefits of acting on customer feedback. Companies, who are more responsive see profit margins 30-40% higher than those who do not take satisfaction into account. These gains are transferable to the human service delivery. The Gates Foundation, for instance, has found that the best way to test teacher effectiveness is, well, to ask the students. Furthermore, there is direct correlation with academic performance. Applied to our social service delivery system, it makes sense that if clients are able to rate their experience, it would inform and drive more efficient and effective programs that will better the outcomes for clients and communities. LIFT-LA will develop an interface (like a Yelp App) to scale constituent voice that the county can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs and expenditures, and that funders can use to guide their philanthropy. Social service delivery programs will be incentivized to properly serve their customer! Myth: Only poor people face life challenges. The reality is that life is complicated for everyone no matter what race, gender, income level, zip code. So much time is spent trying to keep the pieces together--with child care, lawyers, accountants, personal assistants, family and friends-- in order to keep up the appearance having it together. LIFT-LA’s Shaky Ground Moment campaign invites celebrities and high profile public figures (those who are at the forefront of keeping up appearances) to speak up about their shaky ground moments in order to uncover a shared understanding about what we all need in order to get by in crisis—moral and material support from our networks. By elevating their voice in a way that we are not accustomed to, we strip down the sense that needing to reach out for support is a condition of poverty, while heightening the realization that a holistic and humanitarian response is as vital as material resources in times of need. Myth: Poor people are weak and lazy and systems are there to help. In reality, poverty is complicated and getting help should not be, but low-income individuals often find themselves lacking the knowledge of overcomplicated matrix of community resources to find solid footing. In order to challenge assumptions and change perception, LIFT has developed a simulation called LIFTopolis, a city where social service providers are understaffed, underfunded, and overburdened by unmanageable caseloads, much like what occurs in real life. The participants in this exercise—policymakers, philanthropists, social services professionals, etc—assume the identity, circumstances, budget, and goals of a real LIFT client navigating a room of service providers and trying to achieve their objectives (e.g. housing for the family, stable income, nutritional assistance for their children, etc). Through the experience participants gain a greater understanding of what low-income families need from a system, and they collectively build new solutions that can be taken to market and tested. Government did not design the social service system from a human-centered perspective, and thus is unable to address complicated and interconnected problems, or foster trusting relationships between service providers and the families that most need help. The Shaky Ground Campaign, LIFT Yelp App, and the LIFTopolis simulation will bring the client voice and experience at the core of guiding practice and policy change.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "LIFT is a national organization that was founded over fourteen years ago. Since its founding, LIFT has helped over 70,000 low income community members work side by side with volunteer advocates to help them achieve their goals. Today, LIFT operates 11 resource centers in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C.. Over the last decade, LIFT has established a track record of success in supporting families on their path to economic security. In Fiscal Year 2012, 730 advocates helped 11,000 individuals and families move forward on path to economic self-sufficiency. At a time when the economic climate makes the job market hard to enter, affordable housing hard to find, and resources hard to secure, LIFT is telling a different story for its clients. Last year, LIFT generated $13.7 million in wage increases, tax refunds, public benefits, and housing assistance for its clients, providing $1,245 in value for the average client.",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "In some LA neighborhoods, 2 in 3 people are living in or close to poverty! The problem is more than income, it is about the systems that fail to help families get a toehold, and ultimately, discourage them from achieving their goals. Services are often fragmented, bureaucratic, and are built on the stereotypes that uphold the belief that those with less resource are to blame for their circumstance. In contrast, what we find every day in LIFT offices is great resilience, resourcefulness, and endurance that exists in the face of tremendous challenges and stigmas of poverty. LIFT-LA knows that systems built on false premise of who poor people are and what poor people need perpetuate the cycle of poverty (50% of those who move out of poverty will fall back into poverty in a year’s time). It is due to this built-in shortsightedness that billions are spent annually in the fight against poverty without moving the needle significantly over the decade. This is an economic issue for all Angelenos, but also one of social connectedness. A critical piece of the puzzle is still missing: relationships and understanding, aka social capital. We have all faced moments of crisis in our lives when we relied on the guidance and emotional support of friends and family to help us overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges. Likewise, community members struggling with poverty need more than financial assistance; they need help accessing services; they need social connections and emotional supports; they need an empowered voice.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "LIFT is engaging Keystone Accountability, a London based evaluation firm which helps nonprofits and foundations develop better ways of measuring and reporting social change, to develop and test its constituent voice system. Constituent voice is a groundbreaking program management tool that provides nonprofits with a way to measure performance against their intended results while fostering relationships of trust between staff/volunteers and their program participants. Nonprofit organizations working for social change lack a unifying performance management principle to ensure they are making progress towards their mission. Constituent Voice makes the perspectives of the people who are meant to enjoy the benefits of the social service– the primary constituents – visible to decision makers at the organization. The voices of participants should be central to performance measurement and decision-making. Constituent voice provides a constant stream of feedback data that organizations use to be accountable to the experiences of their constituents and improve performance. By combining feedback data with other evidence of results (e.g. job and housing placements, increased savings), constituent voice helps nonprofits discover which feedback is most predictive of participant and overall program success. The process includes:",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "LIFT-LA’s deployment of these strategies will provide a cutting-edge model for other nonprofits and government agencies to improve performance and adapt their programs to better meet constituent needs. In doing so, we will fundamentally change how we design and deploy social service programs throughout the county. Through the Shaky Ground Campaign and LIFTopolis, by 2050, there will be a changed perception of people who are poor--- an important step that needs to be made in order to bring about effective policy. Because of being able to make connections to personal shaky ground moments, people will begin to break down the walls of \"other\" and start to think of what we all need when reaching out for help. And then recognize, through LIFTopolis, that it is neither fair nor just that proper dignified treatment is not in place for people when most vulnerable. Constituent voice will provide the data for organizations to improve programs and the subsequent results needed to lead the conversation about effective solutions to the persistent problem of poverty. Client feedback will demonstrate how a welcoming office environment, trusting relationships, and exceptional customer service support client progress on the path to economic stability. Constituent voice will prove that the “soft skills” that clients develop during their engagement with LIFT (self-confidence, problem solving) are not soft at all; they are what drives long-term change in clients’ lives."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Alliance for a Better Community",
    "summary": "The Alliance for a Better Community (ABC) is proposing to elevate the public dialogue regarding equity and access to high quality instruction delivered by highly effective educators to all students in every classroom, every school. By partnering with the parents and families, students, teachers and administrators served by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), ABC will implement an education and awareness campaign, with a particular focus on media, to discuss and define the critical role parents and families must play in identifying, supporting and retaining effective educators. Public education in Los Angeles and California is fundamentally failing our children. For decades it has underserved and tracked students of color into separate academic and vocational programs, thereby perpetuating the inequities of race, gender and socio-economic status in our society. ABC believes that in order for schools to provide the quality education children deserve and need, parents and families must serve as meaningful partners at the school and district levels. To increase student learning, excellent teachers are needed in every classroom. Research has found teachers to be the most important school-related factor in student achievement. According to a report on the LAUSD, the National Center on Teacher Quality found that, “of the 11,000 LAUSD teachers evaluated in the 2009-2010 school year, 79 percent met the standard in all 27 indicators, signaling that they did not need any improvement. Contrast teachers’ apparent extraordinary level of performance with student performance: only 41% of students scored proficient on the state language arts exam and only 39% scored proficient in mathematics.” There are specific educational disparities that inequitably impact Latinos and African Americans in Los Angeles; one of those is the caliber of teachers in their classrooms. In a report by Education Trust-West, it was found that effective teachers are not equally distributed in LAUSD. Teachers in the top 25 percent are less likely to instruct lower-income students of color. These teachers are also more likely to leave the district's highest need schools. This is critically important since a teacher has more impact on student learning than any other factor controlled by school systems, including class size, school size, the quality of after-school programs and even which school a student attends. Because a high percentage of a school’s impact is attributable to teachers, attracting and retaining highly effective educators becomes critical to making substantial achievement gains that are sustained over time. (Met Project, 2011). ABC is working collaboratively with its partners to advocate for policies and practices that identify, support and retain effective educators in high-need schools across LAUSD and integrate parents and families in the discussion and decision-making. Public dialogue around the topic has traditionally been led by District and union leaders and education pundits who are currently shaping how this issue is framed by the mainstream media and understood by those on the sideline watching the debate. ABC is proposing to elevate the voices of those not typically heard, the: PARENTS and FAMILIES who have students in the District; STUDENTS who have been through the public school system and can testify to the impact that effective educators have had on their academic successes, and; TEACHERS in the classroom that understand the importance of the debate because they care about their students and families. ABC will launch a public education and awareness campaign, through the use of media, that elevates the critical role these stakeholders share in including the parents and families in the educator effectiveness dialogue to benefit student educational outcomes. Some of the key activities will include: convening at least 3 focus groups comprised of teachers, parents and students to discuss how parents and families can contribute to the development of policies and public conversations; developing at least 2 videos and 5 online profiles of parents, teachers and students providing testimonials about the importance of family voices in this public dialogue; developing key recommendations for how parents and families can be engaged in this conversation at their local schools and at the District; developing a document that outlines key principles for engaging parents in educator effectiveness that can be distributed amongst parent groups; and coordinating an official kick-off launch with the produced videos, profiles and information tools that will help inform on-going and future discussions about how to best identify, support and retain effective teachers.",

Parents, teachers and students will continue to be welcomed contributors to the public dialogue about effective teaching, student achievement, and the importance of building a school community that responds to the needs of each one of these stakeholders.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "ABC will work with teacher and student led organizations that have also identified educator effectiveness as a core priority, in order to highlight diverse voices in this public dialogue. ABC will partner with Teach Plus, a teacher-led organization focused on developing the capacity of teachers; and Students for Education Reform (SFER), a student led group with local chapters across Southern California who have also identified “great leaders, great teachers” as important to the success of students. TeachPlus and SFER have been approached to help identify teacher and student voices, respectively, that can speak to the importance of having an effective educator in every classroom and the important role of parents to ensure this happens.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles stands to benefit from this project because the academic and social (human capital) development of our students is being shaped by more than 32,000 teachers that instruct over 667,250 students ever year in our public schools. Research shows that 58% of a school’s impact on student achievement is attributable to principal and teacher effectiveness. As a result, attracting and retaining highly effective educators becomes critical to making substantial gains in student achievement that are sustained over time. Research has also shown that parents are a significant influence in the academic success of their children. Although studies often point to poverty as a significant predictor of low academic achievement, when parents and families are given the skills and tools necessary to create a nurturing learning environment, low-income families and children can defy the odds (Davis-Keane, 2007). Additionally, when parents are given decision making roles and considered equal partners in their child’s education, they can become informed and effective advocates for their child’s education.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "To effectively measure its progress, ABC will set benchmarks for each of its major campaign activities and collect and document the following: number of coalition meetings; number of meetings with key LAUSD staff to discuss policy language on the inclusion of parents and student voice in the identification and retention of educators; number of elected officials that sign on in support of our campaign; number of parents that participate in parent empowerment trainings; number of media stories generated; number of community meetings/events hosted; number of informational brochures distributed; number of public actions taken by coalition, community and parents; number of visits to ABC website and ABC YouTube page that will host the parent, student and teacher videos and online profiles; number of “likes”, retweets, and shares on the various social media sites that the video and online profiles will be shared through; number of visits to the online sites that have seen the videos and online profiles; and number of policies passed via District bulletins, resolutions, or state legislation that correspond to the messages being delivered by the public awareness campaign that highlight parent, teacher and student voices. Tools developed to collect this information may include: stakeholder surveys and interviews, media tracking, media content and framing analysis, policy tracking, and some public polling. Additionally, to track ABC’s effectiveness and meet program outcomes, ABC’s Senior Policy Manager and Parent Organizer will meet with ABC’s Associate Director in biweekly meetings to assess progress and to identify best practices and opportunities for improvement. During these meetings, ABC’s Associate Director will use indicators listed above to determine efficacy and timeliness of program outcomes.",

    "summary": "LA's Promise’s mission is to improve the education, health, and social outcomes for thousands of youth and families living in one South Los Angeles community, the LA's Promise Neighborhood. By 2050, LA’s Promise will have transformed South LA’s schools to have produced 30 years of successful high school and college graduates and will have rolled out its transformative model across Los Angeles’ underserved schools. Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of alumni LA’s Promise will have supported by 2050 will be successful adults giving back to their home community of South LA, which will have shifted from decades of urgent need to a time of prosperous leadership and middle class prosperity. LA’s Promise’s model is its Big Idea: we transform chronically failing public schools and open new schools, both with the underlying philosophy that schools in underserved areas must become community hubs that offer comprehensive support services for students and families. Since its founding, LA’s Promise has become a national leader in the movement to improve public schools. We demonstrate significantly increased student achievement, and our model is scalable to an entire community’s children. LA’s Promise has created a new operating protocol for outside organizations to run LAUSD schools, and it is the first community-based organization in LA history to operate non-charter public schools, proving its effectiveness at scale. LA's Promise works directly with students, schools, and the LAUSD and also screens and manages more than 70 partners who support our school communities by providing more than 200 wraparound services. Recognizing that a young person’s educational achievement reflects a myriad of familial, communal, environmental, psychological, social, health, and physical influences, LA’s Promise combines numerous integrated services to meet each students’ individual needs. Our unique approach is exemplified by two critical elements. 1. LA’s Promise schools are not charter schools: they are neighborhood public schools run by LA’s Promise under a performance-based contract with LAUSD. They are open to every neighborhood child. 2. LAP leverages the community access of school buildings to turn them into community focal points designed to improve all aspects of area life. As the hub of more than 200 wraparound services provided by partners we rigorously recruit, screen, and manage, LA’s Promise schools provide comprehensive support to children and families. LA’s Promise programs are all built on four areas of school and community turnaround: - School Culture Transformation: Before any academic improvements can take root, a school’s culture must be transformed. LA’s Promise relies on a handful of key strategies to promote a welcoming, safe learning environment across its campuses. Strategies include: creating a culture of high expectations, developing school safety teams, implementing a uniform policy (the first at a non-charter LAUSD school); and adhering to research-based, consistent polices on disciplinary issues. - Innovative, Rigorous Instruction: Our philosophy embodies several guiding principals, including: high expectations for all students and staff, a data-driven and systemic approach to all aspects of instruction, and a culturally responsive pedagogy. LA’s Promise educators provide curricular support to LAUSD staff and to all students outside of minimal class time requirements. - Efficient and Effective School Management: LA’s Promise strategically invests in the human capital at each school by providing the ongoing professional development and support necessary for our teachers to become entrepreneurial, strategic, and visionary thinkers. - Wraparound Services: LA’s Promise turns each school into a community hub for delivering essential services all day long. LA’s Promise today works with over 70 nonprofit organizations that collectively provide more than 200 free services to students, their families, and community residents. Services run the gamut from tutoring, to legal assistance and arts programs, to health services. LA’s Promise will use $100,000 across its powerful programs, leveraging the funding to help more than 6,000 middle and high school students in one of LA’s most underserved communities. This will plant the seed for a powerful vision of change by 2050. These 6,000 students will plant the seeds of a bright tomorrow for the region, and LA’s Promise will hone and enhance its work towards a continued broad impact for decades to come.",

Whether it is air pollution and asthma, water pollution and infectious diseases, urban blight and psycho-social disorders, or poor planning (no parks and lots of junk food outlets) and obesity, there is a nexus between the built environment and human health, between environmental health and community health. Since 2005, Heal the Bay has served as an educational and advocacy resource for those residing within the Compton Creek Watershed, an impaired 42-square mile sub-watershed of the Los Angeles River Watershed. The region is historically underserved, park-poor, severely economically challenged, suffers from chronic litter problems, and is also home to one of California’s most polluted waterbodies - Compton Creek. The Creek, which is on the State's list of impaired waterbodies, drains portions of the City of Los Angeles (Watts, Vermont Knolls), South Gate, Lynwood, Compton, and Los Angeles County (Florence/Firestone, Willowbrook, Athens), before discharging into the Los Angeles River and San Pedro Bay. Through our work in the Compton Creek Watershed, we have witnessed for ourselves this lack of understanding regarding the relationship of the environment in students’, residents’, and policymakers’ lives. As such, it is impossible to affect behavioral change for a healthier environment if the agents of the change do not know the issues, see themselves as having a role, or the tools to make it happen. For this grant, Heal the Bay intends to target the next generation through our Healthy Neighborhoods, Healthy Environment Initiative (HNHE), specifically through our Environmental Corps campaign. We will target the scholastic youth of a specific unified school district in the South Los Angeles area; we will develop new leaders who have an understanding of the nexus between environmental and community health through the lens of water. The HNHE’s programs are designed to provide participants a holistic approach to understanding, addressing, and ultimately changing their environment. The Environment Corps has nine educational and action-oriented programming elements to engage a majority, if not all, grade levels (K-12) in a unified school district. The program takes into consideration EEI (Education and the Environment) essential principles and concepts, state and national academic content standards, as well as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) principles, and steeps them in local social, cultural, and economic conditions when implemented. The Environment Corps consists of: Speakers Bureau, Santa Monica Pier Aquarium’s Youth Environmental Education Program, Aqua Explorers, Lunch n’ Learn, Coastal Cleanup Education Day, “The Story of Water,” Creek 101, Youth/Teacher Summits, and Digi-Green. By inundating a school district over a five-month period with environmental programming, students, teachers, parents and district officials are all simultaneously experiencing a similar environmental literacy campaign at the same time. In addition, this targeted population will possess a level of understanding between environment and community to begin making informed decisions about follow through with behavioral changes. In today’s economic climate, we often have a difficult time justifying spending money on environmental projects, no matter how critical, when money is so desperately needed to fund our schools. We would embrace this grant as an opportunity to close that gap, and bestow much-needed funds and resources to a school district, while moving the marker forward on environmental change. Through our Healthy Neighborhoods, Healthy Environment Initiative (HN/HE) Environment Corps, we are committed to: Working with a specific school district to foster on-the-ground environmental improvement projects (e.g. campus and neighborhood cleanups, campus gardens); Providing high-quality, standards-aligned environmental education curriculum for thousands of students and their teachers through our partnerships with schools (prek-12th grade), colleges and youth-serving organizations; Coordinating presentations about environmental issues and solutions where students live, attend school, and recreate; Creating opportunities to participate in capacity-building workshops (e.g. how to communicate with policymakers), team-building summits (e.g. the power of networking and community organizing); and hands-on stewardship activities (e.g. removing trash from the banks of Compton Creek); Strengthening civic engagement outcomes by mobilizing students in a specific school district; Grooming the next generation of environmental leaders tasked with leading the charge in 10 years, 2050, and beyond. These programs working together in a focused manner will increase student access to parks and local open spaces, allowing them to participate in programs that benefit the local watershed.",

    "organization": "Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County",
    "summary": "NHM will engage the residents of Los Angeles in an extensive program to discover and document the urban wildlife of the L. A. Basin – our local biodiversity. The environmental challenges facing Los Angeles demand innovative solutions that take into account the complex relationship between us and local plants and wildlife – the relationships that form our rich and diverse urban ecosystem. Los Angeles is actually an extremely biodiverse city. Neither scientists nor the public understand the full breadth of that biodiversity. If we, as a city, can understand the scope of the natural world that surrounds us, we will have an essential part of the toolkit to develop our city thoughtfully. Los Angeles is in the heart of North America’s only biodiversity hotspot (the California Floristic Province). More than 10 million people live here, along with more species of birds than are found in any other county in the U.S. However, our knowledge of the identities and distributions of smaller species that live here is astonishingly poor. While we know that there are many native, non-native and invasive species here, there has never been a comprehensive survey of urban biodiversity in L.A. – or any other major metropolis in the world. Why is urban biodiversity important? Biodiversity is the sum of all biological diversity living, from ecosystems to genes, representing the ultimate “survival manual,” documenting unbroken lines of evolutionary success from the origin of life on our planet through all previous mass extinctions. To understand how to manage these ecosystems, we need to know who is here so that we can decide together which species to encourage, which to discourage, and how to do so. As the world’s population becomes more urbanized, our discoveries in Los Angeles can benefit the entire planet. NHM’s public research projects will empower Angelenos to influence the future of our landscapes, plants and wildlife. We are using the evolving model of do-it-yourself science – generally known as citizen science – to engage the eyes, ears and cameras of Angelenos in the mapping and stewardship of L.A’s wildlife, the kind that lives all around us but we seldom notice. Angelenos of all ages contribute to this scientific inventory through a variety of mechanisms, from submitting photos to hosting sampling sites in their backyards. Together, our scientists and the public will work together to build place-based strategies for biodiversity conservation that are timely, rooted in local culture and cutting-edge. NHM has been leading individual citizen science projects for decades. In 1994 we launched the California Parrot Project which tracked feral parrot populations in Southern California. Since then NHM has initiated the LA spider and butterfly surveys, and a ladybug census for the city. We are greatly expanding our urban biodiversity programs to include a region-wide biodiversity map, a number of specific studies, and a three-year scientific sampling survey of insects and other invertebrates called BioSCAN. NHM is preparing to build on its extensive previous investment in citizen science projects and scale up with a wide-ranging public information and education campaign that will spur Los Angeles residents to even greater involvement with our urban ecosystems. Our newest initiative, ZomBee Watch, calls on volunteers to help NHM scientists monitor how parasitic flies lay their eggs in honeybees, causing them to abandon their hives, like zombies, in aimless night flights before dying. Understanding this phenomenon could help explain Colony Collapse Disorder (a syndrome in which worker bees quit their hives) that is threatening the world’s bee population and the future of our food supply. BioSCAN will create a transect survey of the insect populations of Los Angeles. Insects are the largest animal component of biological diversity. They are critical to our economic system. Sampling sites include sites from the urban core into the wild hills, from backyards, parks and schoolyards to industrial sites. Microclimate stations will measure variables like temperature and moisture, data which will be useful to make comparisons about how everyday things like porch lights impact our local wildlife. We fully expect to discover and describe hundreds of species during the course of this study – right here in Los Angeles. To conduct and facilitate this work we have built a dedicated team of scientists and educators. We are now building an innovative new website called Nature at NHM. Nature at NHM will provide up-to-the-minute results and information about biodiversity in Los Angeles, connect Angelenos with projects they can participate in, and invite submissions to our BioMap that will provide a long-term view of the flora and fauna of this city as experienced by its residents. This science is critical to our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing world, and the spaces we have built to study it are unprecedented.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "NHM is currently in the process of the most dramatic changes in its 100-year history. The guiding vision for the $135 million NHM Next Campaign is to bring the Museum’s most important collections and ambitious discoveries out of our science labs to create new visitor experiences that explore the “big picture” of life on our planet and the interrelatedness of our natural and cultural worlds. We are only four months away from completion of this historic transformation. NHM Next is changing the way we can educate our visitor base. Each year, 200,000 visitors from local schools visit the Museum – more than a quarter of all the students in LAUSD – free of charge. NHM has the most diverse, broadest visitor base of any comparable museum in the Western U.S.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The pleasure that comes from seeing a hummingbird, hearing a songbird, catching site of a beautiful butterfly, or spying a lizard are well known to rural and suburban dwellers. These experiences are available even in the heart of L.A, where thoughtfully planted pocket parks can quickly attract a rich array of wildlife. Individuals, city planners, school builders and even factories can, with little investment, create biodiverse locations anywhere. This project will make that know-how widely available. NHM will invite and teach Angelenos to see wildlife and understand what attracts it. By engaging everyone in studying this wildlife, and by making the results of our research widely and easily accessible, we will empower everyone to understand that thoughtful planting, even of a single tree, can make all the difference.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "NHM will draw upon many of its existing partnerships to implement our Citizen Science program. USC will base nationally-funded research projects on the specimens and observations we generate. The California Academy of Sciences will work with NHM to create a statewide citizen science network. The California Science Center will share participant submitted data collected in the Science Center’s Ecosystems exhibit, and will be a leading member of the regional consortium for citizen science. The Children’s Nature Institute will host youth walks in the Nature Gardens and the organization Tree People will lead workshops that will teach visitors how to interact with and understand nature and wildlife that they encounter.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "NHM is seeking to measure the health of our environment by identifying the distribution of species in the Los Angeles area. This information is the basis for broader ecosystem management strategies – informing the development of future parks and open spaces and instilling a sense of environmental responsibility towards our environment. NHM will publish the inventory of species that are discovered and described in peer-reviewed scientific journals – providing a clear, tangible research result. We are confident that we will collect and identify many hundreds of species of insects and invertebrates during the study, including dozens of entirely new species never recorded anywhere else. In total, we expect to accumulate at least 60,000 “lots” (small groups of similar specimens) in our permanent collection that can be used by scientists around the world for further research.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The vision of the Natural History Museum is that by 2050 all levels of decision makers in Los Angeles will incorporate biodiversity considerations into their development plans. We will choose street trees and park plants partly for their biodiversity habitat value. We will consider wildlife corridor value on new transportation right-of-ways, and do away with toxic lawn chemicals, replacing them with plants that attract beneficial bugs that help keep plants healthy. We will be a city committed to developing in a way that is always aware of the biodiversity that surrounds us. Eventually, we want tourists to visit Los Angeles not only for Disneyland and Hollywood, but to see and experience a world-class, cosmopolitan city that treasures and protects its biodiversity. Places like NHM’s Nature Gardens, the Los Angeles River, and Griffith Park will become destinations for understanding and viewing the way that large-scale human development and wildlife can co-exist."

    "summary": "July 13, 2012, The Los Angeles Times Business section: “Recession Erases 2.7 Million Youth Jobs, Widens Employment Gap.” If we didn’t know this already, the headline of the article reminds us that youth unemployment is one of the largest social issues facing Los Angeles. The current unemployment rate for 16 to 24-year-olds is 16.5% -- double the national 8.2%. More than 2 in 10 Latino youth are jobless, while 3 in 10 black youth are unemployed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most of us—do-gooders, funders, policy makers—assume that the answer to youth unemployment is pretty straight forward: hope the economy gets better and provide kids training and education to help them get jobs when it does. Streetcraft LA has a different approach to youth unemployment. We don’t provide education and training to help young people get jobs. We provide education and training to empower youth to create their own jobs. Streetcraft empowers low income, at risk, and unemployed youth to improve their economic future through creative economy entrepreneurship. Don’t get the wrong idea—we are not talking about lemonade stands or bake sales. We especially support youth in building creative sector small businesses in three categories: apparel, design, and creative services. Why is this our strategy? Entrepreneurship and the creative economy are the future. The factories are closed, pensions are dead, and design studios are hiring freelancers. And this self-made creative economy is a natural fit for our kids. Streetcraft kids have a lot of creative capacity, energy and hustle that is being misapplied as graffiti on, well, the side of your building. How do we help kids create their own jobs in the creative economy? Streetcraft LA’s approach to launching creative micro-ventures is a three-step model we call engage, partner, launch. First, we engage youth misapplying their creative capacity through graffiti in a training and youth development program we call The Streetcraft Crew. Crew is a yearlong program taught by well-known street artists that empowers at-risk kids to see themselves as artists, designers, and entrepreneurs. Crew functions not only as a positive intervention in the life of at risk youth but functions as a Streetcraft human resources department sourcing the true talent that is ready for step two, a formal paid apprenticeship in Streetcraft LA's retail platform and design studio. Streetcraft LA operates a retail store in Los Angeles that showcases collaboratively designed and produced products and original apparel. Youth are formal partners in this social venture working with Streetcraft’s lead designer to design custom furniture and original apparel such as hoodies, lids, and t-shirts. Over a one-year period, Streetcraft partners are exposed to the product design process including market research, sales, marketing and promotion, distribution platforms and retail management through both direct instruction by industry professionals and experiential learning. Streetcraft partners are paid and also receive a percentage of all sales. Streetcraft partners are also required and supported to complete high school and attend relevant higher education while enrolled. After a year partnership, Streetcraft youth enter a process to launch their own creative micro enterprise. Youth can choose to enter a business planning process in one of three creative sectors: apparel, product design, and creative services. Youth are paired with industry mentors and attend lectures on product development, market analysis, financing and organization development. At the conclusion of the year planning process, youth pitch their venture to a group of funders including banking partners such as Wells Fargo.",

First, we will work the public and social sector to refer youth into the program. Future referral partners will be youth development community based organizations seeking career opportunities for marginalized young people such as the boys and girls club, home boys INC. and other CBOs. In addition, Streetcraft is currently partnering with the department of probation to receive a court-mandated placement for youth arrested for graffiti.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Only 25% of participants in most job training programs increase their annual wages (Jobs for the Future). Over 85% of Streetcraft youth triple their annual income. Within five years Streetcraft will spread this impact throughout Los Angeles county, becoming a countywide initiative with retail hubs in 20 locations working with over 20,000 young people a year. These retail hubs will house our engagement programming, apprenticeships, and provide a commercial marketplace for products designed by streetcraft artists as well as engage 1000 students a year. Our engagement programming will reduce graffiti and illicit street enterprises; the apprenticeship program will increase youth’s annual income and provide concrete technical skills and work experience; and the micro venture program will increase the annual income of students by 50%. Finally, communities where streetcraft hubs are located will see youth unemployment decrease by 5%.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Streetcraft has identified metrics to measure impact. To measure participant level economic impact, we will track participants’ earned income through product sales and micro venture profits. To measure personal and professional skill development we will administer pre/post assessments of basic skills, personal resiliency (University of Pennsylvania GRIT assessment) and professional skills (adobe certification). To measure community level impact, specifically decreases in graffiti, unemployment, and illicit street activities, we will work with local law enforcement to measure localized arrests for graffiti, calls for local graffiti “clean up,” arrests for drug dealing, and local unemployment rates collected by the State Department of Labor.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Streetcraft’s vision for success in 2050 is ambition: reduce youth unemployment through creative economy entrepreneurship by 25% in Los Angeles. It’s imperative that we achieve this. Youth unemployment has long term and systemic consequences. Unemployed youth face lifelong diminished economic and social opportunity. Communities with high youth unemployment have higher crime rates and have higher rates of birth out of wedlock. And a country with high youth un-employment suffers. The tax base erodes. Civic engagement and trust in government decreases. And entitlement programs become unsustainable. It’s not a pretty picture; it is an issue that we must solve now, and Streetcraft LA can lead the way.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Streetcraft LA is a new social venture of the South Bay Center for Community Development (SBCC). SBCC is a long-standing non-profit organization that has been working to empower low-income communities in the greater Los Angeles area since 1976. SBCC has a long history of being one of those do-gooders that operates job-training programs to mitigate unemployment. The organization’s career pathway programs have been recognized by the United Way of Greater Los Angeles as a national best practice and were awarded a Everychild grant (one of the most competitive grants in LA) to apply its model to unemployed at risk youth. In addition, the organization founded the Urban Teacher Fellowship, an initiative that moves underrepresented groups into the teaching profession funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; and The Promo Pathway, a career pathway funded by The James Irvine Foundation and recognized by The Aspen Institute as a national best practice. In doing this work, however, we came to believe that job training wasn’t good enough. We needed to train entrepreneurs who can create their own jobs. So a team of us launched Streetcraft LA as a related, but autonomous social venture to train and incubate youth-led micro ventures."

Our inaugural class of 20 high school juniors, one high school intern, two college interns, and seven high school teachers has met in a summer intensive Los Angeles history and culture seminar at The Huntington Library, and we've met one Saturday a month since then. Each Saturday session is focused on a different \"node\" of regional infrastructure. The day usually begins with a speaker and discussion, and then the LASA group goes into the field and to various sites which fit that day's themes. Our investigation of water started with a history overview of regional water development -- with rare documents -- and we then went to the dispersal facility for Colorado River water coming into the Metropolitan Water District system. Our business investigation took us to a private aerospace manufacturing facility, in business for 57 years, in Glendale, and a tour with that company's chief technologist. We ended that day with a discussion with Idealab executives and entrepreneurs. Our law enforcement day featured a morning with Connie Rice of the Advancement Project (we all read her book on the LAPD), and an afternoon tour with LAPD leaders of the new station and the regional 911 call center; we ended the day with a tour of SWAT team equipment and vehicles. For our investigation of regional transit and transit history, we began our day with seminars by experts from The Getty and the Automobile Club of Southern California on the history of automobiles, freeways, and railroads in the region. Following an on-foot journey from LAPL to Union Station, we met with the lead architectural design team tasked with re-imagining Union Station in the urban fabric of downtown (a stop at the Bradbury Building completed that day). A more recent investigation of the entertainment landscape of Los Angeles took us to AEG's Staples Center, the GRAMMY Museum, the Disney Concert Hall, and an end-of-the-day Bunker Hill discussion with the architecture critic of the Los Angeles Times.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "2050 is a long ways away. But LASA is, in part, aimed precisely at that future. 37 years from now, can we point to a large body of LASA graduates? More schools, more students, more teachers, more partnerships -- all serving to draw together regional ties of connection, education, and community?",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Our metrics for success will include both simple and complex measures. In the short term, can we show that LASA expands its service year to year? Can we build more partnerships with more schools, more teachers, more students, and more institutions? Can we facilitate student interest in moving on to collegiate education, and can we bring important college-success tools and strategies to the students? We can, and will, track these issues by reference to each student and each student's post-LASA trajectory.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "LASA inspires young people to think about their region and their future and how these are intertwined. We aim to foster ties of community and connection between diverse groups of teenagers as we collectively explore how greater Los Angeles works. Along the way, we will offer assistance to those students by way of collegiate counseling and mentoring internships across the basin. Our LASA graduates will have foundational understanding of Los Angeles history and institutions as they move on in their education and into career paths. By maintaining connections to one another and to what we learn together, LASA students and graduates will create new and lasting ties across region and background, ties which we hope will grow as LASA grows and as our student participants move into positions of public service in their lives and careers."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "cARTel: Collaborative Arts LA",
    "summary": "Our idea is to solidify our company as a sustainable arts organization whose focus is on emerging arts professionals. We believe that in LA, there are two types of arts events: the heavily funded, well attended, and smoothly run event geared towards established artists and celebrities; and the unsupported, sparsely attended, poorly managed event for emerging artists. Our mission bridges the two: creating artistic opportunities for thrilling and boundary-pushing artists that will allow them to create on a bigger, better supported level. Now is the time for us to take the next step in our mission. Each year, we engage hundreds of artists, creators and collaborators - and in order to fully invest in artist and art administrators potential, we need the funding to be able to support them on a monetary level. But first, a little bit about us: cARTel’s attracts those not interested solely in performing or watching, but rather in sharing the experience of art with one another. Since 2007, we have produced 22 theatrical productions, 6 music and film festivals, several one-day events such as poetry readings and collaborative mixers, and 2 installation art shows featuring the work of over 2000 multimedia LA area artists. Our work has been covered by the LA Times, NBCLA, Huffington Post, LAist, LA Weekly, The Examiner, and countless blogs and digital hubs. Our Artistic Director, Negin Singh, was featured on the White House blog, “Winning the Future: Obama and Young Americans” and was named one of the top 20 Indian-American Entrepreneurs for 2012 in India Currents Magazine. Our company values include: -Affordability and accessibility. If we can’t afford the price of a ticket, we don’t put it on. -We only produce original work by daring artists and promote collaboration as the driving energy behind the creative process. -The event has to be logistically sound and provide a safe, exciting platform for the artists success. -Process is as important as product. Throughout the creation and planning process, artists and staff alike need to feel comfortable and pushed with respect, patience and fun! Where we are now: We have succeeded in creating a model that attracts artists and audiences to participate in challenging and exciting art-making that is new and comes with few guidelines. Right now, cARTel administrators and artists need to MAKE time out of their hectic schedules to support the mission, which means that though we do a lot already, we can do a LOT MORE. With appropriate funding, we will focus more of our time on expansion of our core programming, free workshops, mentorship programs, a physical space, as well as experiment with new events! Our programs: BROKECHELLA MUSIC & ARTS FESTIVAL What began at a coffee house with 50 people has now grown to a street festival for over 2000. Brokechella is a one-day extravaganza that will feature 38 of LA’s finest emerging musical talent chosen from over 300 submissions. Music, gourmet street food, art installations, boutique vendors, games, and more - all for under $10. NO BUDGET FILM FESTIVAL Beg, borrow, collaborate; NBFF takes indie filmmaking back to its roots. A red carpet event at the Downtown Independent, last year’s edition debuted the Bonus Features panel series featuring some of today’s trailblazing voices and industry heavyweights from major networks and film fests. GENDER LAB Our annual ensemble-based production returns in summer 2013 for the multimedia performance 'Gender Lab.' An ensemble of artists will use dance, visual art, poetry, food and more to create a sensory experience that asks the question, \"How much of a wo/man are you?\" SOUND/STAGE A quarterly live recording series at El Cid, cARTel revives the lost art of the radio play in a swanky cocktail setting. Sustainable storytelling infused with old Hollywood glamour, the LAist hailed Sound/Stage for \"...resurrect[ing] all of the allure and sultry romanticism of Old Hollywood.\" LIVING ROOM TOUR The Living Room Tour is a touring theatre series that commissions original work and thrusts it straight into your living room. Since 2007, LRT has hit up living rooms from Hollywood to Orange County to the Valley to Monrovia and everywhere in between. The 2013 show will tour in October as the first Halloween-themed edition of LRT. EVERYBODY NOSE cARTel’s performance clown troupe creates highly collaborative theater pieces through fully-dimensional, silent clowns. Using both physical comedy and intense character work through an organic realization process, we have trained over 1000 clowns to date. Additional support will ensure free workshops for people of all ages, as well as create a new holiday work for December 2013. We have set a fundraising goal of $200,000 for this calendar year to help us sustain our growing organization which will provide for full-time staff, part-time and freelance coordinators and as a means to sustain our standard of artistic excellence.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success in 2050 is a thriving, durable, democratic Los Angeles arts & culture scene that is truly collaborative and provides opportunities for all types of emerging artists who want to build careers and lives in our city. cARTel wants to show artists that contrary to popular belief, there IS A WAY to make a career out of art-making and passionate collaboration! The creation of art is not limited by venue, by galleries, theatres, and stages. The foundation that cARTel and our partners set in 2013 will encourage emerging artists to be innovative, to collaborate rather than silo themselves away.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Our greatest achievements have grown out of the people and artists with whom we are privileged to work. Our ensemble of dedicated artists has grown over the years into a dedicated, well-rounded staff. In addition to our core team, we have worked with and showcased over 2000 artists over the past five years -- in successful productions and events that span several mediums of art including film, theatre, music, art and more.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We are supported by an advisory board of arts professionals, including producers Brian Udovich, Nick Scaramuzzo, Joe and Lisa LaMattina, filmmaker/programmer Terrie Samundra and marketing specialist Marcella Misserian. Our administrative and artistic ensembles are made up of dozens of young Angeleno artists. We are also currently reaching out to City Councilmembers, as our next goal is to leave a LASTING impact on the city through public works projects that can make LA a better place. We are not a company that wants to go into a theater to create theater; we want to take over a dump and better it and create theater in it. We want to form partnerships with small businesses to collaborate and spread the word about them through our art.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Our biggest metric of success is our fundraising goal of $200,000. If we reach this, it means our audiences were bigger and that our events received more recognition than in 2012. Larger audience means our projects were more accessible. Starting with the expansion of Brokechella in April 2013, it means more artist-to-audience-to-artist engagement.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "With support from grants like this, we will be able to expand each of our programs to become year-long projects that last beyond the day of the event with dedicated staffs to each. We can create new hubs for lovers of film, music, theatre and art to experiment without worrying about the bottom line. We can be the premiere place where experimentation and collaboration is key, which is wildly important in a city where art can sometimes get lost in the Hollywood hustle. For example, we would love to add an extension to our No Budget Film Festival program by creating a monthly called “First Cut” where artists can show the first cut of their new film to a group of smart and creative individuals who can provide feedback. For Brokechella, we could create industry showcases for the artists we’ve worked with in the past to ensure they are getting the attention they deserve. In this way, we can ensure that all of the artists that come through our doors can receive help and constructive attention AFTER the day of the event."

    "organization": "Fulfillment Fund",
    "summary": "The Fulfillment Fund is a Los Angeles based 35 year old nonprofit that has evolved into a leading college access organization with a multipronged model for success. The Fulfillment Fund’s mission is to make college a reality for students growing up in educationally and economically under-resourced communities. A college degree is more important than ever in creating a pathway out of poverty. We promote higher education and college bound culture through our high school program in partnership with several LA Title 1 high schools. Our program is designed around our classroom-based proprietary College Access Curriculum, one-on-one college counseling, and experiential learning opportunities such as college tours and our annual signature event, Destination College. We are unique in that our program is part of the regular school day, making us an integrated part of our students’ school day. Our holistic approach and commitment of “One Student a Time” enables us to extend educational opportunity and create long-term positive change for our students, their families and the surrounding community. Numerous students do not see college as a reality due to the cycle of poverty, cost of attendance, and lack of college graduate role models in their communities. Compounding the problem are budget cuts that lead to overcrowding 1:35 students and few or nonexistent college counselors 1:1250 students in area Title 1 high schools; the Fulfillment Fund is bridging this gap to service these students. We partner with the schools to provide students with the much needed guidance and information to graduate high school, apply to and attend college. The education of one student not only impacts the student, but it can also increase the economic growth of their family and surrounding community exponentially. Our hope for 2050 is that the greater LA community believes in our vision that all students, regardless of their circumstances, should have the opportunity to attend college, graduate, and actively participate in transforming their communities and creating a better society. Our students are LA’ future business leaders, parents, and community advocates that will help spread the importance of the value of higher education. Our immediate goal for the future is to reach more students, families, and educators by expanding our signature event, Destination College beyond our current students. The Fulfillment Fund has successfully held 16 Destination College events for high school program students, their parents and mentors; it is often the first time many of them visit a higher education institution and begin to see attending a college or university as within their grasp. Destination College is always held on a local college campus such as Loyola Marymount University, the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Southern California. Grade specific workshops are delivered by Fulfillment Fund program staff and outside content experts that include: Overview of the 4-college systems, Financial aid options, Personal essay writing, College Applications 101, and Leadership 101. Several workshops, led by professionals in creative fields, incorporate youth development and creative self-expression to further engage students. The event also includes a robust college fair attended by 60 or more national college recruiters who provide general information and address our students’ concerns about financial aid, cultural challenges, and support services. For many students, Destination College is a pivotal, life-changing experience as it marks the first time they realize that they can belong in the college community. After attending the event, students are armed with critical information and have a sense of empowerment which translates into certainty that they can attend their dream school no matter the cost because they have options. The event provides parents and mentors with valuable resources and support about the importance of their student attending college in addition to providing guidance on how best to prepare their teens for college. In LA County, where only 32% of students complete college prep coursework A-G\\; Destination College has the ability to ignite passion in students and stress the importance of succeeding in high school in order to be accepted to college. The main goals of Destination College are to: 1.\tMotivate students to apply for and attend college by connecting them with college representatives and current college students. 2.\tSpread practical knowledge about the college admissions process and financial aid through informative workshops. 3. Educate more parents in the college going opportunities that exist for their children and help remove the financial barriers they may think hinder these opportunities",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The Fulfillment Fund has been able to gauge the need of the Los Angeles community and build a successful model that works for students. The Fulfillment Fund provided mentoring to help students graduate high school and educate them about college access. Through the interactions with students, parents, and educators, we saw the great need for the community to be educated on college acccess for all students especially those in first-generation, low-income or under-resourced areas. We were able to build on our mentoring program and develop proprietary high school curriculum that is delivered in partnership with schools during class-time and one-on-one counseling through our College Access Program Advisors. We also have a CAP (College Access Program) Leadership Crew that meets once a month.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "By 2050, we would like to see thousands of students filling local college campuses – perhaps over multiple days to engage in workshops and college fairs. Our hope is for first generation students to have confidence that they can and should be part of a college community. We envision thousands of Fulfillment Fund alumni serving as positive role models for the generations to come and giving back to their communities. Parents will know that college is viable for their children and will understand how to support them through the college going process. As our participants in Destination College become the parents, business leaders, educators and community leaders of the future Los Angeles we will shift the conversation in Los Angeles so that all students have the opportunity to attend college regardless of their circumstances.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "A good education is key to helping elevate individuals from the cycle of poverty. A 2009 U.S. Department of Education study showed that the average income by a high school dropout was $19,540, those with a high school diploma increased to $27,380, an associate’s degree earned an average of $36,190, and a Bachelor’s degree earned more than double a dropout salary at $46,930. These statistics clearly indicate that the average high school dropout is likely to earn wages that are below the federal poverty level and that the higher the education level, the greater chance for economic self-sufficiency. Study after study has also shown that a higher education will deter one from crime, lowering incarceration rates and also promotes a higher degree of engagement in community and civic activities. This project will lead to a better educated workforce and create a ripple effect that impacts students, parents and families, and Los Angeles businesses by 2050.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "We measure success in multiple ways, but our primary indicator is a pre and post survey is distributed to student participants at our Destination College event. The survey is designed to measure student impact and is reviewed for quality improvement measures. In 2012, a parental survey was developed and distributed to parents and caregivers that attended Destination College with their students. These two surveys will be the main form of assessing the event and students attitudes about attending college. The survey gauges the students’ interest in attending college.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The Fulfillment Fund partners with several Los Angeles area high schools to enroll students for Destination College. Our goal is to create a college going culture in these schools among the students, parents, and educators."

    "title": "An Rx for LA  Combining Art & Technology to ReBuild Los Angeles",
    "slug": "2013/an-rx-for-la-combining-art-and-technology-to-rebuild-los-angeles",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "The Last Bookstore",
    "summary": "Our idea is to expand an existing program that has created dozens of new businesses and hundreds of new jobs – while helping revitalize an entire neighborhood - and attracting over 150 new businesses and working creative individuals – all without one dollar of public funds. An RX for Los Angeles will take what one person working with the assistance of dozens of different community members on each project - accomplished in Downtown and to now expand that program's scope in DTLA and then the reach out to the rest of Los Angeles. So rather than it being a program to get one LA business to move to another part of LA – or competing with programs offering financing from the same pot of money or promoting facade improvement grants - RXforLA will look at the needs of each geographic area and the needs of each of the different major business categories (fashion, film, tech, small retail stores, food) to see what is working or not working. Concurrently, the different creative and tech industries are also examined to see how each of them might help any of these projects. And, finally, each potential solution will also be examined by how it might impact any of LA's other indicators. Now this may sound complicated, but there are those who quickly learn how to think in this way – and having multiple eyes look at each deal also makes it easier. It also helps that - at times - the more constraints you have– the easier it might be to see the one thing that will work best. It also helps that we have a team of serial entrepreneurs who have started multiple businesses and have experienced just about everything that can happen. The program's initial expansion will be to target specific social and industry wide problems within Downtown – and then follow that with looking at specific industries & social problems outside of the greater Downtown area. These focuses will make it easier to judge the results outside of the Downtown area. And now for a successful example of the process. When the Last Bookstore opened its vastly expanded space at 5th & Spring, the newspapers were filled with all the local bookstores closing - new, vintage and even antiquarian bookstores. They were closing due to not just AMAZON discounting new books but because AMAZON was also selling other people’s used books - as were on-line booksellers’ abebooks and eBay. But after researching those challenges – and making the necessary business – and artistic - decisions, the store was profitable from the day it opened. And the fact the store has expanded twice within a year after it opened – is no accident. The plan was developed by store owner Josh Spencer and supported by the person who leased him the space – Brady Westwater, who started RXforLA , after he helped negotiated a lease structured to make it financially possible for the store to first open – and then be able to expand. And – again – none of this this was a fluke or an accident. It was all planned And it has also fulfilled two other markers. It has created not only a far connected local community, but a regionally connected larger arts community that didn’t exist before from all over Southern California. And again – this was no accident – it was all planned from the very beginning. Lastly old store - 7 employees, new store - 27 employees. Turning to fashion, we have team members who run some of the leading LA Fashion Week shows for LA designers but, unfortunately, most designers don’t do shows in LA because our fashion week seems to be thrown together at the last minute – spread out all over town, in multiple venues on different days – and that makes it impossible to attract the buyers and critics who attend New York's Fashion Week. So everyone is finally asking– why can’t we all show under one big umbrella in one place with one set of dates? But for that to happen – planning would need to start now to select a site and dates and then start to promote the hell out of the fact that LA will – finally – get its act together and try and have a real fashion week. RXforLAT, if it is successful in getting the grant, will develop a site promoting the major cultural industries of Los Angeles – a single place where people from around the world can come and see what is being planned. And once that site is launched – it will be a lot easier for the different producers of Fashion Week to agree upon dates and venues – since once everyone agrees to lock them down – then a serous effort can be made to lure buyers and critics from New York – and many other cities - to LA Fashion Week. But first we need to create that infrastructure and even then - it won’t happen over night, But it needs to start somewhere – and it needs to start – now. And to accomplish even just that – would be a huge win this fall for LA2050.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "First, we are somewhat unusual in that we have already been very successful with our project - more successful in generating new businesses than any other economic development organization - even with six and seven figure budgets in our market area.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "One of our fashion projects is working with groups and individuals who are trying to bring manufacturing jobs back to LA. They are either setting up or working with existing groups of workers so that not matter or how large - or how small a job is - and no matter what skill that job will require - any designer will be able to get affordable quality work done. This helps make up for all the lesser skilled jobs LA has lost over the years by creating higher skilled and higher paying jobs.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The simple answer would be a Los Angeles that was as economically healthy as it once was. The more complex answer would be enough good paying jobs for everyone who wants a job - to be able to get one - and a business climate that supports and rewards business. Going much beyond that would require far more space to properly discuss.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The RXforLA program is an expansion Brady Wastewater’s long work with a wide variety of stakeholders in DTLA. Since moving there full time, he was a founding member of Downtown LA Neighborhood Council where served as both president & VP. He also recruited the founders of Gallery Row, Nic Cha Kim and Kjell Hagen to DLANC and worked with them and Art Walk founder Bert Green with their projects since their inceptions and leased the majority of the first galleries on Gallery Row. He also helped start – and was president of LANCC - a city-wide Neighborhood Council organization and he was one of the five members of the DWP MOU Committee that negotiated the first MOU with a City Agency.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Among our partners are the over 100 community members who have helped or worked with over the past decade.

    "slug": "2013/creating-a-positive-learning-environment",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Playworks Southern California",
    "summary": "Playworks exists because, for many low-income children, recess is not a fun experience. Recess is where bullying happens, fights break out, and student become too upset to absorb lessons taught in the classroom. A 2009 nationwide Gallup Poll of 2,000 elementary school principals revealed that 89 percent of discipline-related problems occur during recess and lunch. (“Gallup Survey of Principals on School Recess”, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2010.) Principals block out time every day to deal with discipline problems from recess, and teachers deal with the aftermath. Additionally, many low-income children live in areas where safety is a concern. They often come from neighborhoods challenged by poverty and crime with limited opportunities to engage in healthy play with their peers. As a result, these children come to school not knowing how to appropriately engage with peers which contributes to a playground experience riddled with conflict. Students who return to class angry, frustrated and scared cannot learn. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics notes in its 2012 policy statement The Crucial Role of Recess in School, that “Recess serves as a necessary break from the rigors of concentrated, academic challenges in the classroom. Equally important is the fact that safe and well-supervised recess offers cognitive, social, emotional, and physical benefits that may not be fully appreciated when a decision is made to diminish it. The American Academy of Pediatrics believes that recess is a crucial and necessary component of a child’s development and, as such, it should not be withheld for punitive or academic reasons.” (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/1/183.full.pdf+html) Playworks has a solution to the chaos on the playground that maximizes recess and uses play as a transformational tool for educators and children. We believe that building a high-functioning, positive recess climate directly affects the creation of a positive school climate. A 2010 report entitled School Climate Brief from The Center for Social and Emotional Education, founded at Columbia University, states “Research supports the notion that positive school climate promotes students’ ability to learn. A positive school climate promotes cooperative learning, group cohesion, respect and mutual trust. These particular aspects have been shown to directly improve the learning environment.” Playworks places a highly trained program coordinator at each of our partner schools to run games and physical activity before, during and after school, teaching respect, inclusion, empathy and problem-solving through play. Playworks also trains student leaders, through the Junior Coach program, to resolve conflicts on the playground and beyond. Playworks gets all kids in the game, regardless of background, skill or physical ability. By using play, a universal activity accessible to every school child, Playworks creates a positive school climate where students know what is expected of them and their peers. As a result of this improved learning environment, students can do better in school. According to Playworks’ year-end surveys of teachers and staff, our partner schools have seen an increase in class participation, teachers have been able to reclaim an average of 19 hours of teaching time that would have otherwise been lost dealing with student conflict and students have experienced a dramatic reduction in bullying and disciplinary incidents.",

Teachers are free to teach and children to learn. Without the fear of violence and exclusionary behavior at recess children engage in various games and activities. Children learn teamwork and leadership skills that they use not only at recess but in the classroom and in the community. Educational success will not be determined by your zip code as all schools will be safe, fun and rich with educational opportunities.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Playworks’ primary partners are the Southern California elementary schools we serve. In our fourth year, Playworks SoCal currently provides our model physical activity and play program in 26 low-income elementary schools serving approximately 15,000 children in the Los Angeles area daily.

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Playworks inclusive approach to play gets all kids active during recess and offers more opportunities for vigorous movement throughout the day. The link between physical activity and children’s performance in school is becoming more and more clear. As reported by the New York Times in April, 2011, “...the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a meta-review of 50 studies and found ‘substantial evidence’ that school-based physical activity ‘can help improve academic achievement, including grades and standardized test scores.’ Educators need not worry about losing precious teaching time: the report found ‘no evidence that time spent in recess had a negative association with cognitive skills, attitudes or academic behavior.’” A randomized controlled trial of Playworks found that children in Playworks schools spent more time at recess engaging in vigorous physical activity than children in control schools."

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The harsh neighborhoods of L.A.'s inner city contain thousands of families held hostage to crime and gang warfare, even as their health is degrading as a result of fast-food addictions, rampant unemployment that keeps them poor, absence of fresh foods. The capitalist tool of choice, here, is the sale of illicit drugs. Combined with a prison industry that profits from incarceration, the absence of male supervision and father-figures in general is now the norm. Truly, the only possible way out of this mess is by means of an economy that TRICKLES UP, one grown with simple seeds that also leads to health. Food is the only entry level economy that works, central to everything worth living for, including family unity, culture and tradition, the celebration of life. No rational solution will emerge from entitlement programs that throw money or coupons at the problem without involving life transforming processes that cure people in ways they need curing. Where the bottom falls out of our society, the support for people falling through that hole must involve nutrition, jobs, and genuine food justice. Success in the year 2050 is an inner city environment remediated of toxic substances in homes (partnership we will enable through involvement of fellow builders volunteering to help us move that piece forward); hardscape neighborhoods softened by tree plantings giving shade, making neighborhoods strollable, lessening heat in summer, that lead walkers to park settings where farms dot the former hardscape. Success is more (if not all) children well-nourished, even if poor, children who appreciate where food comes from (not the supermarket), regularly partaking in the unifying grace that breaking bread with family and friends bestows on us when we sit together at a common table, who give thanks and enjoy the happiness of common gratitude. Success is the end of our oppressive \"war on drugs\" that punishes people for wanting to medicate themselves out of their misery, that locks them up, splintering families, delivering profits to faceless corporations that build and own human warehouses. Success is recognition for the civilizing effect that agriculture once bestowed on early human society, matched in the present and giving people tools of survival that they, themselves, activate at will. Success is money earned locally that circulates in the neighborhood to improve the quality of life, that grows as a community asset like the food growing where they live. Success is a city proud of the people in the hood, in the barrio, who are productive. Success is children learning, unburdened by hunger and lack of sleep. Success is fathers reuniting with their families, looking forward with hope. Success is the eradication of adult-type diabetes in children, the eradication of child heart disease brought on by obesity. Success is love between neighbors, who take pride from mutual self-sufficiency and a means of survival that they share.",

    "slug": "2013/out-the-window-videos-on-la-buses",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "L.A. Freewaves",
    "summary": "PROJECT SUMMARY Out the Window will transform our daily commute. A million Angelenos will wake up and go home not to the drivel of commercial TV but to innovative, informative videos that not only teach them, but also engage them – surround them in art. How? On the bus! Yes, the bus – reversing the popular vision of transit from a drudge to a recharging experience – aiding in our efforts to create a multi-transit Los Angeles, while bringing art (real, experimental art) to people who often feel locked out of the city’s museums and galleries. Art should be, will be everywhere. Out the Window makes that happen. FULL PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION Bus riders, Out the Window’s target audience, are 2/3 Latino, half female, half under age 34 and predominantly low income, a difficult demographic to connect to inexpensively. Reaching this population of 1,000,000 riders per day with transformative health, social, and cultural information during their daily commutes improves the quality of life, increases riders, creates urban dialogue, treats people as people instead a pair of consumer eyeballs. The buses can be our mobile art museums for everyone. Out The Window videos will be: •\t1/3 by artists on the full breadth of issues of concern to them •\t1/3 about community health such as access to nutritious food, obesity amelioration, and promotion of healthful lifestyles and •\t1/3 about other issues, such as environmental, educational and social, produced by LA nonprofit organizations. •\tA portion of each category will be made by LA youth enrolled in video programs. •\talso appear on out-the-window.org and Freewaves facebook page daily for viewers’ comments and sharing In 2013-14 Out the Window will present 312 videos, (6 per week) each with an open-ended, pointed question in English and Spanish to which viewers may respond via text. The combination of message and feedback loop will be a powerful carrier of vital dialogs by, about and in Los Angeles among the 85% of riders who use cell phones. Out the Window uses Transit TV’s video system on all 2,000 L.A. Metro buses, reaching Los Angeles’s residents with creative and essential messages while providing free culture on the largest art distribution system in the country to the nation’s most populous county. This program is ready to fully established this year. It launched in 2010 with a MacArthur grant; it tested technologies, networks, viewers and programming in 2011. It gathered resources in 2012 and now is ready to take off with all elements in place! IMPACT ON THE ARTS AND CULTURAL VITALITY Socio-politically, the arts increasingly reflect the ever-widening divergence of economic, educational and cultural access facing Los Angeles and the nation. This may be observed in the unfortunate schisms between so-called “high” and “low” culture; and between profit-driven mass culture and artist-initiated personal and community expressions. Freewaves believes there are many good solutions to close the gap. Through its unwavering faith in every person to understand idiosyncratic artistic styles and ideas, Freewaves asserts the human right of every person to access their communities’ artistic expressions. Freewaves’ optimism is firmly based in the statistical analysis of our 540 interviews undertaken during the pilot phase of Out the Window. Specifically, 91% of bus rider respondents indicated they liked art. Half found that art was present on the bus, in some form, while half did not perceive any art on the same buses. Of the respondents, 73% regularly watched the TV programming available on all L.A. Metro buses. The programming tells stories, shares creative impressions and offers critical insights about Los Angeles. See www.out-the-window.org/videos for previous examples of the artists’ videos that reflect a range of subjects and styles including performances in urban public spaces, background information about LA neighborhoods, animated scenarios, ruminations about nature and investigations of other art forms. The next round of videos on the buses will add issues impacting health, such as: availability of affordable, healthful exercise options, regional disparities in health and nutrition services and dangers of lead paint and asbestos. The bus-riding population has profound health needs; many commuters traverse neighborhoods lacking access to nutritious food, parks, and adequate health and wellness resources. Furthermore, because 33% of bus riders lack Internet access, consuming mostly mainstream media, bus riders comprise an expensive demographic for health service providers to reach. Videos will be made by many of L.A.’s media artists, ranging from emerging to established, plus students in the region. After consultation with health and wellness specialists, they will eloquently and entertainingly address specific health issues and point the public towards affordable or cost-free solutions.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "58-12 Design Lab",
    "summary": "Los Angeles suffers from some of the highest rates of unemployment in the nation, and is also home to the nation’s largest population of storytellers. Coincidence? We hope not! 58-12 Design Lab proposes to unpack these facts in the context of LA through the production of a book titled “Writing on the Job,” launching the “LA Stories” series of books with topical, engaging stories on Los Angeles. This initial volume will revolved around the theme of jobs. What is the landscape of employment in Los Angeles? How is the everyperson faring in today’s world? What might a future world look like for jobs in LA? What are the unknown, overlooked, and strange stories that haven’t been told? By engaging with poets, fiction and non-fiction authors, screenwriters and playwrights, journalists, and writers of all stripes, we hope to achieve several goals.\n\nFirst, we will provide an alternative medium to the talking heads that the mainstream media provides through storytelling in new scopes, from an intimate story of a family going through economic hardship, to the big picture vision that a sci-fi novella can provide but that non-fiction accounts often overlook. We believe that this approach offers new insight into the well-worn ground of economic hardship that we have all experienced over the past several years. The book will be directly distributed free of charge to local libraries, schools, and similar public institutions so it can be disseminated throughout the city, and can provide a cause for community-building book launch events throughout LA.\n\nSecond, we believe that storytelling is, in fact, a radical means to create real change. So often, our reality is dictated by the stories we hear and tell, and to change those stories with intention offers an escape from this self-fulfilling cycle. Storytelling offers a way for people from different cultural or socio-economic backgrounds to relate to one another, to understand one another, and to create positive social change. So we believe that beyond mere media, our collection of stories will spark real change for employment and income in Los Angeles.\n\nThird, we believe that by partnering with storytellers, one of the largest and most underemployed groups in Los Angeles, we will be able to offer real and direct support through a grant given to each writer contained in the volume, as well as through editorial support and name recognition. We hope that LA Stories will continue from the success of this initial volume, becoming an LA institution that supports, fosters, and promotes writers in this city. LA has amazing human capital in this area but it will take a project like LA Stories: Writing on the Job to galvanize this group, and to create a community that can project the individual storytellers beyond competition to shared success.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success in 2050 would look like this: Los Angeles would be known around the world as the preeminent city for contemporary literary culture. But more importantly, it would be known as a city that fosters creativity and keeps talent because of its supportive culture. It wouldn’t follow the conventional rules of high or low culture—just that culture would be produced, from kids in schools, to authors with books, to screenwriters collaborating on a spec script. It would be a city where people understand one another—their neighbors, the people groups that might be defined as “other,” and themselves. It would be a city where there is a vibrant economy with jobs and healthy incomes for all—and that the creative economy of storytellers would be the engine that drives this growth. Success for us, in 2050, would be the realization of a Los Angeles that is even more itself, that is home to the kind of culture that cannot be found anywhere else, of a Los Angeles where you would want to live, work, and create.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "We will measure success one two fronts: First, we aim to create a beautiful, well-designed, riveting, pleasurable book that can be enjoyed by people around the world, by Angelenos, and at no cost to local public institutions. We will measure success through a rigorous editorial process for book production that will gauge responses and respond to those responses as we move forward. This will include responses from collaborators as we produce the book, from outside reviewers prior to production, and from the general public after the book is produced. This knowledge will build over time as we use the success from this initial volume to create the next LA Stories edition.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We will collaborate directly with about fifty storytellers: poets, fiction and non-fiction authors, screenwriters and playwrights, journalists, and writers of all stripes. We will work with existing and up-and-coming institutions in Los Angeles in order to find the best and most diverse set of writers to work directly on this jobs-themed edition. Some of those institutions may include the Los Angeles Review of Books, UCLA and USC, 826LA, the Last Bookstore, and other similar organizations.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "58-12 Design Lab is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization formed and registered in the State of California. In 2009, three friends at UCLA who were going into architecture, law, and business sought to use the power of good design in order create positive social change. They embarked on a journey that led them somewhere between anthropology, journalism, and design and this unique approach has continued as the organization now focuses on place-based, social research and media production that reveals the overlooked, the misunderstood, and the opaque.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Our project will directly benefit Los Angeles in three ways. First, it will provide an alternative medium through which we can understand our city and, in particular, understand its landscape of employment and income. By understanding this landscape, we can begin to understand not only better understand the problems that our city faces, but more importantly we can begin to know the right questions to ask as we move out of the recession and into a vibrant, productive city for the twenty-first century. This understanding will be directly encouraged through the free distribution of the volume to schools, libraries, and other public intuitions, providing these organizations an opportunity for community-building events, and directly providing them with a new resource."

    "organization": "Collaborative Tutoring",
    "summary": "At Collaborative Tutoring, we believe in working in collaboration with community partners to utilize resources to guide and support children and young individuals from all walks of life towards success; while fostering positive learning environments- through education, mentorship, community service, and volunteerism. The Mentoring through Education Movement (MEM) project is based on an innovative student-centered approach combined with mentoring and experiential learning to revolutionize traditional ways of learning. The MEM project will allow youth and young adults (in the 7th through 12th grades) coming from high-crime, high-poverty communities within Los Angeles County, to receive high-quality tutoring services in combination with real life experiential learning through volunteerism, community service, and restorative justice. Volunteerism will play a large role in the student’s education by promoting learning both inside and outside the classroom. Students will volunteer with non-profit organizations of their choice for a minimum of 21 hours over the course of the project. Types of volunteering opportunities will positively impact: the environment (i.e. conservation), community enhancement, education, the homeless, humanitarian efforts, etc. All volunteerism and community service activities will promote altruism for the greater good of humanity. Restorative justice will be carried out through the power of poetry, art, creative writing, and/or skits/plays created by the students, which will be showcased at Collaborative Tutoring’s Mentoring through Education Movement Celebration. Collaborative Tutoring focuses on the meaningful experiences young people encounter within their lives. Our “Educator/Mentors” will provide one-on-one and/or small group tutoring and mentorship, using the student’s Life Plan as a tool towards success. This movement will allow students to experience education with a whole new approach through relationship building. Our goal is transform our student’s way of learning through various avenues. Not only will students learn within the classroom setting, but they will continue their learning through experiences outside of the classroom. The Mentoring through Education Movement is expected to develop teaching communities in which teaching not only happens in the classroom, but within the communities in Los Angeles as well. Teaching communities will allow students at a middle school and high school level to teach both adults and children by using what they have learned within their experiences. For example, a high school student could adopt a “reading buddy” to improve literacy among elementary school aged children. These teaching communities could be modeled and replicated in all environments and among all ages (young and old). A harsh reality in Los Angeles is that our young individuals either are, or are at high-risk of dropping out of high school, being on probation/incarcerated, entering gangs, becoming homeless, etc. Due to the lack of access to resources, it is through the Mentoring through Education Movement that will continue to educate and guide young individuals towards success within their lives. In addition to tutoring services, Collaborative Tutoring’s Mentoring through Education Movement will provide Life Skills workshops, to enhance young people’s socio-emotional development and leadership skills. Workshops include, but are not limited to: using Microsoft Office, basic computer skills (i.e. typing, software), Internet use, E-mail, FAFSA, CAHSEE Prep, College Prep, parenting, job readiness, budgeting, forgiveness, leadership, health, college applications, communication, technology, etc. Successful completion of the program will allow students the chance to become part of the MEM Internship program. MEM Alumni will be able to apply to become an intern with one of our collaborating partners. Within this internship program, young individuals will have access to a business mentor/s in the workforce. Through Collaborative Tutoring’s Mentoring through Education Movement, we expect the project to impact education with: •\t100% of our students will show improvement in their academics •\tAn increase in High School Diploma attainment and Graduation rates •\tIncrease in the passing of CAHSEE’s (California High School Exit Exams) •\tIncrease in TABE (Test of Basic Adult Education) test scores •\tIncrease in knowledge of college preparation (FAFSA, college applications, college navigation, etc.) •\tIncrease in college going rates and/or the desire to attend college (community college, four year institution, trade school, etc.) •\tIncrease in confidence levels within their education and personal development •\tIncrease in knowledge and access to resources within their communities •\tIncrease in knowledge of career exploration and goals •\tIncrease in life skills and leadership development •\tIncrease in the knowledge and use of skills and tools (i.e. communication, Microsoft Office,",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Mentoring through Education will benefit LA by providing innovative, hands-on, and experiential educational services and workshops, with the development of Learning Communities. We expect over 300 students to be served throughout Los Angeles County in high-crime, high poverty communities over the course of the project. However, through the implementation of Learning Communities, the number of individuals served throughout Los Angeles will multiply drastically. Through these teaching communities, LA will benefit by creating more jobs, decreasing unemployment rates, improving the health of LA residents, creating safe environments for residents to live, and inspiring residents to educate their children at a very young age.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Collaborative Tutoring will evaluate the Mentoring through Education Movement using several methods. We will create an evaluation plan, which states our objectives, desired results, our indicators and data to measure our results, and sources of data. In combination with the evaluation plan, we will conduct quarterly SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). This will allow our organization to evaluate the project to see if we met our objectives and deliverables and make adjustments as needed.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Collaborative Tutoring is an organization driven by the ultimate goal of collaborating with businesses, organizations, agencies, the young people, and their families to promote teaching through mentoring. Collaborative Tutoring has been able to connect with community-based-organizations and other agencies to provide services and resources to not only students in the Collaborative Tutoring program, but to at-risk and high-risk youth and young adults in low-income communities. We have also implemented an informal mentoring model embedded within the organization’s structure to improve student educational success and their socio-emotional development as well."

The children and youth are identified as being at risk of failing or dropping out of school, at risk of joining a gang or using drugs. Program Goals: 1. Strengthen the social, emotional, cognitive and behavioral competencies of children living in poverty; 2. Improve the children’s commitment to school and to academic achievement; 3. Improve the children’s understanding of healthy standards of behavior; 4. Improve each child’s resilience, self-efficacy and sense of the future; and 5. Strengthen each child’s sense of self-worth. 6. Help reduce the negative impact of an absent mother or father on a child’s well-being and life potential. 7. Help reduce the negative impact of poverty and other socio-economic stressors on child’s social and emotional well-being, academic performance, and ability to develop essential life competencies. 8. Increase opportunities for every child’s success in school and in life. 9. Help youth develop self-esteem, motivation, and self-management skills to work towards high school graduation and higher education. AADAP's School-Based Mentoring Program supports economically and educationally disadvantaged children in public elementary and middle schools with volunteer mentors who spend at least one hour per week at the school for the entire school year. The mentor and the youth meet for a one-to-one mentoring in the classroom, school library, school computer room, neighborhood community center, or other set location. They shall meet once a week to read together, play sports, play games, or simply talk about life and personal issues – just as friends do. Mentoring Activities include but is not limited to the following: * Arts and crafts * Team Building * Goal setting * Conflict resolution * Motivation * Cultural diversity and sensitivity * Communication skills * Leadership development * Self-esteem enhancement * Career exposure/awareness * College exposure/awareness * Community service * Social events or field trips The youth we serve are some of the most disadvantaged in South Los Angeles. •\tWe are serving youth who are not attending school. •\tWe are serving youth living below the federal poverty level. •\tWe are serving youth whose parents are incarcerated. •\tWe are serving youth whose father and/or mother have abandon them. •\tWe are serving youth whose siblings have already joined gangs and/or have been in juvenile detention. •\tWe are serving youth who are teased at school because of some physical or emotional problem that is evident to their peers. •\tWe are serving youth who are not allowed to play outside after school because the neighborhood they live in is so dangerous. •\tWe are serving youth who are being raised by grandparents. •\tWe are serving youth whose father and/or mother are using drugs. •\tWe are serving youth who are giving up on school and on life. There is hope! Research shows that well-run mentoring programs are likely to be a powerful intervention for improving the well-being and academic and life skills of disadvantaged youth. It also states that youth in mentoring programs have higher levels of functioning including higher scholastic competence and grades, fewer days of class missed, lower levels of substance abuse, more positive peer and parent relationships, and less physical aggression. Youth who participate in the program show dramatic improvements in their daily lives. •\t85% made progress in their overall school performance. •\t74% participated in class more. •\t58% improved their classroom behavior. •\t58% had a better sense and interest in the future. •\t64% developed more positive attitudes towards school. •\t64% developed higher levels of self-confidence. •\t80% avoid adolescent pregnancy; •\t84% experience higher levels of self-esteem; •\t76% do not begin using alcohol and drugs •\t62% become more aware of educational and career options; and •\t53% experience improved relationships with their peers and family members.",

    "organization": "CitySourced, Inc.",
    "summary": "Crime is pervasive in our communities and its damaging effects are well documented. Despite the negative impacts, criminal activity and crime tips are often not reported by citizens because of fear associated with ‘snitching’. What if we could make it extremely easy for anyone to anonymously report criminal activity and crime tips from a smartphone? With our easy to use smartphone, CitySourced proposes to give residents of Los Angeles a technology tool to report and monitor crime happening around them. The CitySourced crime reporting app will allow Los Angeles residents to log and categorize crime witnessed in their neighborhoods from their smartphones or the web. They will also be able to get a quick view into what crimes are happening around them by viewing other reports and public data on a map. Regardless if reports are submitted anonymously or a user chooses to include contact telephone and email information, the CitySourced app allows for communication between citizens and public safety officials through the secure app and platform. In addition, the user would have several options for the crime information submitted in the reports, including discreetly adding a photo or video to a report, providing more valuable data for public safety organizations. CitySourced would be able to use this data to alert authorities to a crime in progress or add to the data available to police and the City. The data gathered will help Los Angeles citizens be more aware of their environment and allow them to understand the location of crime hotspots in the city. By allowing two-way communication through the mobile phone between citizens and the police force we provide better service for residents affected by crime.",

    "organization": "HoneyLove",
    "summary": "Since 2006, more than one-third of honey bee colonies have collapsed worldwide—a global phenomenon now called Colony Collapse Disorder or CCD. There is no one smoking gun causing CCD; in fact, scientists now widely agree that it is a combination of factors. The best science tells us that if present trends continue there will be no more bees by 2035. That is, if we fail to act—if we fail to recognize this disaster in the making and don't take strong action to counter the slow march to extinction.\n\nAt HoneyLove we have made it our mission to inspire and educate urban beekeepers as a means of conserving this critical species. Whereas bees used for pollination in the migratory beekeeping industry are suffering from colony collapse disorder, bees living in urban environments—especially Los Angeles—have been spared this fate. Why? Because the reasons contributing to the decline of the honey bee are absent (or significantly reduced) in the city environment. Urban bees can find more than enough forage in our gardens, landscaping, and weedy areas to feed themselves throughout the seasons (commercial bees are fed an artificial diet of sugar water, confectionery sugar and high fructose corn syrup). Because there is plentiful forage, urban bees are spared the stress which has contributed to the species' vulnerability. And since the vast majority of the forage in the city is pesticide-free—because most homeowners aren't dumping industrial-strength chemicals on their yards—bees have one less critical enemy to contend with. While the city represents the bees' best shot at surviving and thriving, at HoneyLove still have a lot of work to do to ensure they will have a healthy ecosystem in the future.\n\nIn spite of being relatively pesticide-free compared to big agriculture, Los Angeles still uses an alarming amount of consumer-level pesticides that pollute our soil and waterways and affect our already poor air quality. Consumer products are often harmful to pollinators like the honey bee and yet they do not have to be labeled as such. HoneyLove's vision for 2050 is of a pesticide-free Los Angeles, achieved through grass-roots campaigning and led by beekeepers in each of LA's 95 communities. We believe that by creating educated urban beekeepers we're also creating stakeholders in our communities who can represent our concerns about pesticides. It is our belief that by training and educating beekeepers as ambassadors of the pesticide-free Los Angeles message, we can begin to tackle this enormous problem one household at a time, one lawn at a time, one school at a time, until we've built a critical mass which will simply not accept the use of chemicals in our backyards, parks, and public spaces. Taking pesticides out of the equation will have unquestionable benefits for our environment; soil will be free of chemical contaminants, run-off after storms will lack the poisonous punch it once had, and citizens will breathe freely knowing they won't be inhaling carcinogenic toxins. The only indicator a pesticide-free LA in 2050 doesn't touch on is proximity to parks and access to free space, but it does ensure that those places will be cleaner, healthier environments for people to enjoy. Our parks can become shining examples of pesticide-free, natural environments and serve as the inspiration for citizens to think differently about the products they use at home and in their gardens.",
    "goal": null,
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "As we've learned through our legalization efforts, you can't just take on all of Los Angeles all at once; it works much better if you build your case community by community. Since the first step of our Pesticide-Free Los Angeles campaign is to target the use of pesticides on city and county property, we'll start by approaching community councils to gain support for our motion to suspend city-sponsored pesticide applications in parks, medians, and other public properties. The metrics for success are fairly straightforward: we can gauge progress by the number of councils reached and where our motion stands in the Los Angeles City Council legislative agenda.\n\n",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Since being founded in April 2011, HoneyLove has been leading the grassroots effort to legalize urban beekeeping in Los Angeles, beginning with an extensive feasibility study and outreach campaign in Mar Vista. From there we gained the additional support of 10 Neighborhood Councils throughout Los Angeles: Del Rey, Greater Griffith Park, South Robertson, Silver Lake, Hollywood United, Atwater Village, West LA, Boyle Heights, Lake Balboa, and Chatsworth. Our thorough campaign work resulted in Councilman Bill Rosendahl putting our motion before the Los Angeles City Council where it is currently being studied by the Planning and Land Use Committee. And while we can't say that we have achieved full legalization yet, in creating the community model and approaching it from a grassroots level we've created momentum which cannot be stopped.\n\n",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The conventional wisdom is that Los Angeles is polluted, smoggy and utterly beyond repair. Residents who don't know anything else succumb to apathy and do little to invest in the quality of their local environment. Beyond helping to create a healthier ecosystem (air, water and soil quality), we believe that Pesticide-Free Los Angeles will elicit an enduring investment in the local environment from a significant and meaningful number of the city's denizens. People are always shocked—then pleasantly surprised—to learn that the city is the last, best hope for the survival of the honey bee. A HoneyLove project will educate, enlighten and inspire the hearts and minds of current and future residents of Los Angeles and as a result will garner the magnitude of investment we need to reduce pollutants and restore the health of our communities. Our project's most tangible offering to the Los Angeles community will be a mobile app that allows users to track the use of pesticides in public spaces, and receive a score card for how their local park, green space, or high school sports field is performing.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The year is 2050 and Los Angeles has fundamentally, beautifully transformed; has successfully reinvented herself like so many Hollywood starlets throughout our city's history. Bursting with rooftop gardens downtown, raised beds that feed entire families and sustainable suburbs alive with native plants, there is not a useless grass lawn in sight. Los Angeles has morphed from the consumer/commuter culture of yesteryear into a hyper-local, walkable, sustainable, responsible city with a healthy future. Not only has Los Angeles undergone a physical transformation from a concrete jungle to a local-food-producing haven, it has also taken on a new cultural personality. Shedding their former consumer identities, Angelenos now think of themselves as producers capable of growing their own food and providing for themselves. Residents of Los Angeles have become fiercely protective of their local environment and are proud of the fact their city was the first to be 100% pesticide-free. Honey bees and beekeepers have become symbols of this newfound identity, representing the catalyst that was needed to forge the new Los Angeles. Our city will have become the gold standard for living alongside honey bees and we will be globally renowned for our bountiful honey harvests. And rather than being cast as killers and pests, honey bees will be returned to their rightful role at the very center of our existence.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "HoneyLove's success can be attributed to our eagerness to partner with other local orgs and community groups. In addition to working with other beekeeping clubs, we'll collaborate with groups like Surf Rider's Ocean Friendly Gardens, Tree People, and LA Green Grounds. In order to bring LA up to speed with other great cities around the world, we will build on the work of Capital Bee, Pesticide Action Network, Beyond Pesticides, Pollinator Partnership, Xerces Society, and more. We intend to work at the community level so we'll actively seek partnership with each of LA's 95 community councils. Our strategy is to create advocates (beekeepers) in each community so our true partners are the individuals advancing the cause on a hyper-local level."

    "summary": "Poor communities are usually portrayed as fonts of violence, stagnant thinking and deficit outcomes. But we at Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural see the poor as rich with talents, skills and imaginations. Every person, even without outside resources, is by nature regenerative. The concept behind arts-based healing workshops is to tap into and draw out this abundant capacity to establish healthy lives, families, and culture – even in a faltering economy. A new currency of restoring and transforming from one's own gifts opens up a new imagination of how to relate by giving and getting, with healing practices and disciplines. This is about renewing community rooted in caring and sharing.",

    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We presently facilitate arts workshops and the Young Warriors project with El Nido Family Resource Center in Pacoima, one of the poorest communities in Los Angeles County. We have partnered with Los Angeles Mission Community College in Sylmar to do our \"Celebrating Words\" festivals. We have done workshops and talks at the Barry Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, the largest juvenile lockup in North America. We have conducted talks and workshops in Sylmar and San Fernando high schools, Discovery Prep Charter, the Cesar Chavez Learning Academies, the Maclay and Olive Vista middle schools, among others. And we have had about 10 schools from the L.A. area a year do field trips to Tia Chucha's to see first hand what we do. We plan to extend these.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles is called \"the Entertainment Capital of the World.\" It has a creative economy that generates close to $4 billion in state tax revenues, employs a million people in Los Angeles and Orange counties, and accounts for $100 billion in sales/receipts in L.A. County alone. Yet there are whole areas, whole neighborhoods, often for miles on end, where there are no bookstores, no movie houses, no art galleries, no cultural spaces. These culturally barren sections include South Central L.A., East L.A., the Harbor, and the Northeast San Fernando Valley. The arts are concentrated in downtown, the shoreline, Hollywood, museum row, and such. We are not opposed to these vital tourist-laden centers of culture and commerce. But we need a neighborhood arts policy in Los Angeles so that every community can benefit from cultural store fronts, independent bookstores, public art projects including murals, workshops in all the arts, digital arts, and more. Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural's \"Art Transforms Community\" workshops prove this works in any neglected and resource-limited area of the city. Flavored by the people of the Northeast San Fernando Valley, Tia Chucha's is a model of how every community can have its own cultural wellness center -- they can name it for someone else's aunt if they wish. The point is that the arts are they key \"log,\" the one stake that when moved opens up a logjam. The arts reach across ethnicity, race, religion, and culture. The arts are the unity-in-diversity that finds commonality and wholeness to one of the most divided and contentious cities in America.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The Northeast San Fernando Valley is a community of 500,000 – the size of the City of Oakland -- yet it had no bookstores, movie houses, art galleries, or full fledged cultural spaces until Tia Chucha's opened its doors twelve years ago. We now provide a bookstore, a deli/ artisan shop, arts workshops, an art gallery, film nights, weekly Open Mics, community dialogues, and author readings. In addition we host Young Warriors, a youth empowerment group, often working with troubled youth through mentors, rites of passage, and the arts as well as own poetry press, Tia Chucha Press, and the only outdoor annual literacy festival for the greater San Fernando Valley: “Celebrating Words: Written, Performed & Sung.” We have a Mexica (so-called Aztec) danza resident group, Temachtia Quetzalcoatl, officially sanctioned to teach and perform this art form from pre-conquest Mexico and Central America. Also since Tia Chucha's creation we've seen the birth of independent groups like El Hormiguero (the Anthill), Bikesanos Bike Club, the San Fernando Arts Collective, Youth Speak Collective's Sports, Mural, Gardening and Digital Arts projects, and the establishment of a new high school with academies in Social Justice and Humanities, the Arts as well as Engineering and Technology called the Cesar Chavez Learning Academies. Our presence in a mostly run-down strip mall with many uninhabited spaces has brought new small businesses and even a major market chain. Tia Chucha's has proven that the arts stimulates economic activity while helping reduce violence, apathy, and low school participation.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Everyone is laden with creativity, ideas and an abundance of talent. Liberating this will make 2050 a more peaceful, cooperative and thriving time. The future is moving toward integrality: How to integrate mind, body and soul in people, but also aligning the economy, politics, and culture to the regenerative power in such people and the regenerative capacity in nature. We will move away from the brokenness, alienation and fracturing that is prevalent in our time. The main direction is this--to become a complete human being means becoming a complete artist. Oppressive and exploitative conditions, which are rife in today's post industrial realities, are already being pushed away by the technological advancements and the intellectual/creative developments in our society. 2050 should see all this taken to its conclusion--a world where the common love of beauty and truth brings science and art into a unified whole. A time when people's passions becomes their professions, and working for others means working for oneself. This does not mean homogenizing everyone, but a true individuation that at the same time leads to the common development, rise and enrichment of all. If there were cultural spaces like Tia Chucha's everywhere, we can begin to see the building blocks of such a future, such possibilities, such an integral time and place.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "We presently serve 14,000 children, teens, adults, and seniors a year at Tia Chucha's. Our staff has surveys on paper and from head counts. We also do analysis of all our workshops for content, form, and outcomes. Already in twelve years, we have seen higher school participation and the rise of imaginative ways to do the arts and projects like gardening, mural projects, activist collectives, and more. Our facilitators and instructors work with us to evaluate the growth of each participant in the arts and in the community. We also hold monthly Community Council Meetings open to the staff, facilitators/instructors, volunteers, and board members to evaluate and propose what we do at Tia Chucha's and how we can do better."

    "organization": "Bright Star Schools",
    "summary": "Bright Star Schools (BSS), a charter management organization operating three charter schools in the Mid-City communities of Los Angeles and in the heart of Koreatown, has designed and introduced the Connections Program, an innovative and inclusive guidance program aimed at preparing our students for high school graduation and college success. Bright Star Schools’ primary goal is to have all of our students college-ready by high school graduation, with several opportunities for university and college attendance available to them. We currently serve 1,111 5-12th grade students between three school sites and will grow our network to include a fourth school in the 2013-2014 school year. The ethnic mix of our student body is 81% Latino and 11% African-American and 5% Korean-American. Less than 15% of our students have parents who went to college and less than 24% have parents who speak English as a first language. 87% of our students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch. Most students arrive at Bright Star Schools more than two years behind academically. Two years ago, based solely on academic performance, nearly 50% of our students were not ready to be promoted to the next grade. Faced with this alarming statistic, we designed the Connections Program to provide a comprehensive and individualized approach to our students’ education to ensure that they graduated high school on-time with a clear post-secondary plan. The Connections Program is an original approach to serving at-risk youth by providing personalized wrap-around supports and resources for every student and their family. Our students face many unique challenges – neighborhood violence, poverty, learning disabilities, immigration issues, etc. – which, unresolved, can make the difference between dropping out of school and becoming a college-bound graduate. To address these challenges, each student is assigned a “Connector”, a staff person who is available at all times to listen, set academic and personal goals, give advice, and identify community resources that will ensure that their students are passing their classes, feeling safe and secure at home, and preparing for their future beyond high school. The Connections Program meets the academic, social and emotional needs of our low-income and minority student body by providing comprehensive supports and resources reaching all facets of a student’s life. Connectors meet with their student’s teachers, counselors, service providers and family members to coordinate efforts, keep lines of communication open, and provide insight and support when needed. In this way, every student has an ally on staff whose sole purpose is to help them graduate from high school prepared to enter and succeed in a four-year college or university. The Connections Program takes the concept of traditional guidance counselor several steps beyond what would be seen in a classic public school. In a typical middle or high school, there is normally one guidance counselor for hundreds of students. Most students never meet their school’s guidance counselor, or only meet the counselor if they are referred for some wrong-doing. Our Connectors are guidance counselors in the truest sense of the word – they provide personalized and around-the-clock support to help students become successful high school graduates prepared for college and career. What makes the Connections Program so innovative and unique is the time our staff devotes to each student and the comprehensive support each Connector provides to our students and their families to ensure that there are no roadblocks in their path toward high school and college graduation. Jaylan Alexander plans to be the first person in his family to attend college. Although highly motivated, he comes from a poverty stricken family and had no resources to help get him through high school, let alone navigate the high costs of applying and attending college. Through the Connections Program, Bright Star provided Jaylan with school uniforms, bus passes, and school supplies. His Connector made sure that the school covered the cost of his college applications and his Connector provided him with ongoing academic guidance and emotional and social support. Jaylan’s hard work and commitment to his education, coupled with the financial, academic and emotional support he received through the Connections Program, has put him on the path to college success. There are many others like Jaylan who have been able to succeed because of their involvement in the Connections Program. We have seen the Connections Program have a significant impact on the academic and social success of our students, enabling them to graduate high school prepared for the rigor and social challenges of college life. As Bright Star Schools grows, we will increase our impact on the students in Los Angeles that need us most.",

It is the daily attention to our core values that has helped Bright Star Schools gain remarkable distinction as an academic leader among Los Angeles schools. California gives each public school a score on an Academic Performance Index (API); 800 being the state proficiency goal on a scale of 1000. Our continuing success is illustrated by our 2011-12 API scores:",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Studies have shown that students who are well prepared for college coursework are more likely to stay in school and earn their degree. Through the Connections Program, Bright Star Schools provides our students with individualized support and guidance in the form of a Connector and school-wide services such as the College Center and College Clubs that are aimed at preparing all students for high school graduation, a successful college experience and a fulfilling career. We see the Connections Program making an enormous impact on the at-risk youth of Los Angeles by leveling the playing field for those students traditionally prone to dropping out of high school and under-represented in colleges and universities. The Connections Program guarantees that every student receives exposure to college-bound services and opportunities tailored to meet their specific needs. Students are paired with an advocate who supports them throughout their middle and high school career – this continuity is critical for students who may experience upheaval in their lives that can disrupt their education.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Bright Star Schools cannot hope to make a sustainable impact on Los Angeles students without the ongoing support of our city’s businesses and social service providers. For example, DirectTV provides students with mentors through their employee volunteering program and collaborates with staff to lead vocational training to our high school students.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "In their initial meeting, Connectors and their students fill out intake forms to gather information on the student’s school and home life, interests, and goals and aspirations. Connectors identify gaps where additional supports are needed (tutoring, enrichment classes, social services referrals, etc.) and with their student, set short and long term goals that they revisit and revise on a regular basis.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Studies show that students tend to drop out of college because their expectations—academic, social, or both—don’t match up with the reality of college life. Ill-prepared students also suffer from lack of motivation, inadequate preparation, and poor study skills. The National Center for Education Statistics indicates that dropout rates are particularly high for African American and Hispanic students. Other student populations at greater risk of dropping out include those who are the first in their family to attend college, and those who have limited English proficiency. The Connections Program aims to reverse this trend among those at-risk students in our city, and remove any potential barriers they may face as they prepare themselves - academically, financially, and emotionally – for college life."

How will you measure success?": "We will measure success by the ability to open the 17 acre facility this year, which currently is unfunded; by the number of health care professionals and community leaders who are trained in mindfulness; the number of new mindfulness teachers who go through InsightLA Programs; the number of communities with new practitioners and new teachers; and the number of people these teachers reach. Digital metrics will also be tracked, though additional resources will be needed to take that initiative to scale. The institute also has unprecedented opportunity to introduce mindfulness to LA based celebrities and athletes who can then engage the city and the world with the empirically-proven, scientifically-validated, experientially-contagious, cost-effective solution of meditation and mindfulness. Therefore, the number of influencers going through the program will also be tracked.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "This project will create a world class resource for training leaders in the mindfulness movement in the heart of Los Angeles. With new access to a property of 17 acres of pristine nature, this project will enable InsightLA to create a functional space for training health care professionals, educators, and other community leaders to become mindfulness practitioners and teachers in Los Angeles. By 2050, the program will have trained thousands of Mindfulness Ambassadors for the city, including health care professionals, educators, and community leaders, and provided the catalytic support to make Los Angeles a 'mindful city' that addresses health and environmental indicators upstream. In addition, free training resources will be provided online, so anyone can improve their mindfulness and drive positive behavior change in their own lives. This project, while focused on health, attacks all of the indicators at their root, by giving each of us and all of us the tools and training to be more mindful and considerate about the way we engage with the social, political, and natural environment and contribute to our families, our communities, and our city."

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In the year 2050, through School Fuel all Los Angeles Unified School students will start their day with a nutritious and healthy meal. In part due to School Fuel’s educational messaging, students will be informed on how to make decisions regarding healthy habits and healthy eating. As a result, the percentage of students that are overweight will become a small minority and their risk of future health problems such as type 2 Diabetes and obesity will be significantly reduced. A healthier city will not only reduce the health care costs of Los Angeles, but also increase its productivity.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "In a recent study, obesity has cost Los Angeles County over $10 billion yearly in increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity. If the obesity epidemic continues, the impacts on our economy and health care system due to chronic diseases are dire. For children, being unhealthy will hinder them from obtaining a quality education, and eventually gainful employment and full participation in society."

    "summary": "For 25 years the all-volunteer GWHFC has helped the homeless of Hollywood and West Hollywood survive life in the street by serving them a fantastic meal every night, seven nights a week, which we make entirely from high-end food donated to us all over town. With the GWHFC/UCLA Mobile Clinic, which we founded in 2001, we help them take care of their myriad medical and legal concerns. Now, we'd like to focus on getting them OFF the street, one by one, into safe, clean, and attractive apartments of their own choosing -- not public housing and not slum housing, but apartments which we wouldn't mind living in ourselves (just as the meals we serve are planned and prepared to our taste, as if we were going to eat them, not they). Over the past 18 months we've \"housed\" twelve chronically homeless \"clients\" in that way, and we've come to realize that we are better at it than any of the dozen or so public and private agencies which use up enormous amounts of money in salary and overhead to do the same thing. Why are we better? Because we are volunteers, and we come to know the people we serve organically: we meet them over a really good meal, and little by little they tell us about themselves, and we are able to figure out which of them are ready to join us back in the mainstream. We aren't social scientists, and we aren't bureaucrats -- we are a cross-section of the community much like they are, and it is no wonder that they come to trust us and we come to trust them, because they know we are doing what we do out of love for our fellow man and for no other reason.",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Getting fifteen chronically homeless people off the street and into permanent housing will (1) vastly reduce the amount of taxpayer money spent to take care of them IN the street -- in shelters, in emergency rooms and hospitals, in police stations and jails and prisons; (2) since the effort will be entirely volunteer and OF the community, it will draw the community as a whole into a closer relationship with the homeless generally and help to do away with the notion that we live in one world and they live in another; (3) it will save fifteen perfectly good people from a downward spiral from which most of us would be hard pressed to pull out and, in the case of a number of them, it will return them to a position of productivity alongside the rest of us: to jobs, to social and political interactions of all kinds, and (sure enough) to VOLUNTEERING to help others who are still on the downward spiral.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Having been called into being as volunteers by the City of West Hollywood in 1987, we suffered the awful realization just two years later that West Hollywood, as a political entity, wasn't ready to defend a group that was helping the homeless. We were accused of perpetuating homelessness, encouraging criminal behavior, despoiling the neighborhood, and destroying property values -- all this for serving hungry people something to eat once a day -- and we were effectively run out of town and into Hollywood, suddenly an orphan group of volunteers but with a reputation in the media for having fought city hall and survived. From that point forward we have only gotten braver, because little by little we came to know that there were a lot of people like us in the community who wanted to do something \"good\" but didn't know where to begin. We have since fought any number of running battles just to keep going -- against neighbors and neighbors' groups, against politicians and other \"social service agencies,\" and, just two years ago against a company which sued us for creating \"a public and a private nuisance.\" When that happened we were defended pro bono for eight months by a partner and four associates of one of the largest law firms in town, and at the end of it the judge in the case threw it out with prejuidice. We are now stronger and more effective than we have ever been, and we continue to grow stronger still. We serve an ever-better meal, to between 150 and 200 people every night. We have two or three new volunteers coming to us every day, and our ability to network in the community at large is nothing short of extraordinary. As far as we know, no other ragtag grass-roots organization formed to help the homeless has lasted as long as we have and attracted so much support. And yet we are still at the takeoff point, in that every new volunteer who means it has a new idea as to how we can reach deeper into the community and how we can avail ourselves of its strength to do more for the weakest among us.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The US Department of Housing and Urban Development",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "We will measure it one homeless person at a time -- who is no longer homeless but back with the rest of us: indoors, with a place to sleep at night, a place to wash and keep clean, a place to be warm and safe and to store clothes and other things, and a place to receive friends and family, as if having friends and family again wasn't just a matter of figuring out how to survive but a matter of living and enjoying life.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success in 2050 would be the citizens of Los Angeles -- not the politicians, not the activists, not the social service agencies, but the citizens -- long since having awakened to the fact that life is only wonderful if the wonder of it can be shared and celebrated as widely as possible for the greater good. In the latter half of the Twentieth Century political and economic systems were created ostensibly to make that happen, and it simply didn't. Now we have another chance: not for ideological reasons or with a view to creating yet another enforceable system, but because there is no greater social logic than doing good for its own sake, we should all follow our instincts and pitch in. The number of volunteers who want to join the GWHFC is growing in geometric proportions. By 2050 will they and others like them have nothing more to do, because people will no longer be living in the street? Not a chance. But there is every chance that if we keep going as we are going now, we will be able to move the newly homeless off the street almost as fast as they come to it, and it will be easier to do it than it is now, because most of the community will be engaged with us in the process. We will ALL be volunteers."

    "summary": "DIYFO shares the sentiment set forth by the LA 2050 report, that cultivating and training creative minds is paramount to Los Angeles’ continued cultural success. We teach a variety of DIY skills, through events and workshops – always with a charitable component. Currently we present events in host spaces, but we want to expand and increase the frequency and scope of our programming, and to also establish a home base in Downtown Los Angeles that serves a threefold purpose: to provide a permanent home for learning, to exist as a gallery for showcasing work and ideas, and to house an open-source studio and workshop, in which community members can access tools and equipment as varied as 3D printers, bicycle repair tools, and sewing machines. With specific classes designed to reach adults, children, and teens – covering a variety of skills and techniques – DIYFO will provide an opportunity to learn and grow: to develop talent that may otherwise have been left uncultivated, and to promote participants’ lifelong appreciation for the importance of making. As with the workshops we currently present, a portion of the instructional fees will directly benefit local non-profit organizations. In addition, DIYFO will host talks and special events, designed to coincide with exhibited work, offering a unique opportunity for the public to access and understand art in an interactive environment. Work will be available to purchase, and a portion of the proceeds from each sale will be donated to partner non-profit organizations. Finally, DIYFO will provide access to equipment and art supplies in a studio setting. Visionaries of all skill levels will get the chance to learn from one another, and to collaborate on impactful, innovative work. We will also continue to coordinate directly with charitable organizations to provide onsite instruction and outreach to the people they serve. At DIYFO, we believe that everyone has creative potential, and that there exists great value in the ability to work with one’s hands – to solve problems, and to make something completely new. We believe that this approach will instill a confidence in the people we reach directly, and create a ripple effect of increased appreciation for arts and culture, citywide.",

We have teamed up with organizations like Junior League Los Angeles and Aviva, and are driven by our desire to reach those in need. DIYFO has also partnered with organizers of events like Unique LA Local Love 2012 and the LA Weekly Pancake Breakfast to host onsite DIY projects – free of charge – for the events’ thousands of attendees, and will partner with Jubilee Music Festival to do the same in June. We also continue to provide programming around the city in our sponsor venues – teaching DIY, while working to raise money for a variety of organizations.",

How will you measure success?": "Because DIYFO is relatively young, establishing a designated headquarters will be, in itself, a huge measure of success. However, this initial milestone will be followed by markers that include the diversity of the workshops we offer, the range of the artwork we exhibit, the resources we are able to contribute to people in need, the scope of the skills and equipment to which we provide access, and the ability for DIYFO to sustain itself: with the long-term goal of expanding its physical presence, via satellite spaces throughout the city.",

We also plan to bolster our community and commercial partnerships to provide innovative and dynamic experiences for our constituents. Finally, we hope to develop programming with institutions, universities, and galleries to activate the DIYFO space and other organizations’ spaces around LA: fostering citywide enrollment, and weaving DIYFO (and the culture we promote) into the very fabric of Los Angeles.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success would mean significant reach for DIYFO, but more importantly – a thriving creative and collaborative culture that would be the standard in Los Angeles: allowing artistic talent to grow and remain in LA, and attracting gifted individuals from elsewhere. As the lines between art and science and technology continue to blur, we hope to create a community on the frontier – cultivating traditional artistic techniques, and educating people about technologies like 3D printing and fabrication – resulting in cultural endeavors that cross boundaries of medium."

At the center of ARTmageddon was a new website which allowed the idea live and be shared digitally (www.ARTmageddonLA.com). It featured 250+ listings for performances, concerts, screenings, literary events, and exhibitions Angelenos could walk, bike and metro. ARTmageddon began as an simple idea inspired by Metro's Carmageddon II, with almost all the previous support being donated time from dedicated volunteers, but it quickly became the largest citywide art party Los Angeles had ever seen. ARTmageddon connects local artists to each other, encouraging collaborating between artists and arts organizations with each other, and with other local businesses such as restaurants, bookstores, and retailers. This central hub also supplies artists and arts organizations with the tools and know how to start going door to door in their own neighborhoods, creating a structure to offer the opportunity for artists to get to know their neighbors face to face. Expansions to enhance ARTmageddon in 2013 include printed materials including a detailed printed map and decals for participating locations.

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "One of the major and critical benefits of ARTmageddon centers on cultivating neighborhoods and their connection to artists. Los Angeles is a city defined by its freeways. And yet, there are dozens of beautiful, culturally and historically rich neighborhoods, that while tourists travel from hundreds and thousands of miles away to experience, we often aren't even aware of what is waiting only steps from our front door.

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In 2050, Los Angeles will be a zero waste city. All waste will be recycled or diverted. There will be no landfills or incineration and the streets will be cleaner.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "LAANE was formed in 1993 to improve the quality of life and the environment in low-income communities in LA. Using research, organizing, coalition-building, policy advocacy and communications, LAANE has won programs that uplift job quality in local industries, provide health benefits for workers, and increase the number of and access to good jobs as well as training for them. Our work has won policies that link economic development to cleaning up the environment in low-income communities.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Success will mean that 1) a massive waste diversion program is adopted and implemented in a way that yields a minimal 75% diversion rate by 2017, and a 90% diversion rate by 2025, 2) the program is innovative and serves as a model for other regions, and 3) tens of thousands of disadvantaged workers are trained and employed in the revamped recycling industry and the new local remanufacturing industry. In addition, existing jobs in the industries—from collection to remanufacture—will be upgraded to family-supporting standards."

    "summary": "South Central Los Angeles, known for it’s notorious mentions in rap songs, seedy motels and abandoned houses, gang wars and riots, has a population of sickness and disease, violence, drug and human trafficking and it all starts with a corrupted mindset. MLoveizm stands as a beacon of light to reach those who feel suppressed, stifled and limited in their community through the medium of art. Art transcends demographics through a deep seeded sense of relatability in life experiences, thought processes that strikes a nerve to take action. Our first big goal is to facilitate a creative environment where Artists can learn through internships, business development/entrepreneurship, workshops, artist showcases, and jobs through future publications like MLoveizm magazine, upcoming book projects, film documentaries, art inspiration field trips and more for local Artists as well as those who travel to South Central to grow and learn. The jobs would be mainly artistic such as filming, photographing, editing, lighting, writing, painting, fabricating, designing, styling, researching and more. We would also like to facilitate business minded individuals that understand and appreciate the arts as the oil to our engine and further teach in our workshops as well. We take a deep interest in character building emotionally, mentally, physically and spiritually. Our hopes is to meet the Artist where they are at in their life and cultivate the greatness within through collaboration, education, practical skill and business building. We want the Artist to exude confidence just as much as their work does. From starting off as Artists, growing as entrepreneurs and innovators we know what it is like to gain ground on making dreams become reality and bringing up as many Artists and art supporters as possible in the process.",

Currently we work with Alleyne Connect, Arianna Sikorski and two interns. We hope to open the opportunities with funding.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "From working, guiding, promoting, encouraging and teaching artists, we have seen them go on to attain more jobs as entrepreneurs, build their own brands, manage their creative and business time, and develop confidence in heart and mind. We have impacted Artists in knowledge, perspective, understanding and wisdom in their personal life as well as provoked them to dig deeper and see meaning in art as well as create depth in their own work. We are pleased to see our imprint on individuals as they go on to transform the world in positive sustainable ways.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In 2050 there will be more opportunities for artists in South Central to be encouraged by the satisfaction of working in the arts and doing what they love. This will place confidence in the Artist and their families..It will also nurture them to be able to teach others skills and knowledge to create a ripple effect with art that can change the landscape not only in public venues but in and around homes and most importantly in the hearts of our Los Angeles tribe. There will be more opportunities for individuals to experience art and the benefits it creates by those it touches to think differently, speak accordingly and act in faith of future change. We hope to have attained a large building where everything we do can be pushed to greater levels. The building would facilitate art shows, workshops, art days, film productions, film screenings, offices and our own MLoveLife café where we would also make healthy juices, smoothies and more. The café would also serve as a place to learn about health in body, mind and spirit. By then we hope to have had at least 18 books published, at least 72 magazines published, several documentaries created, 9 world tours, MLoveizm hubs in several major art cities and secure 10-20 jobs in each hub for artists and business professionals. We also hope the numbers for interns and volunteers to increase as well! We are currently in the process of gaining our 501c as well!",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "We recently have other like-minded individuals that are catching the vision and supporting the heartbeat. We currently are working on demographic and impact spreads from past events and online analytics. We have rose from 3 people showing up to our Art Day events in 2010 to around 15-30 currently and growing. We are now streamlining Art Day to once a month and Workshops starting this April bi-monthly. We hope to have at least 15 or more enroll per Workshop and to grow from there. Currently we have 2 interns working twice a week with more inquiries to volunteer. We hope to have 5 or more for part-time positions during business hours. We also hope to give jobs for booking/scheduling and logistics, event planners, business writers, public relations, filming, editing, photographing, journalism, animators, illustrators, nutritionists and botanists. We have already witnessed the benefits artists are experiencing from MLoveizm's TV interviews opening doors for Artists to use them as a media resume. We have also seen interns create their own businesses and branding to further their dreams. We have spoken with Artists who say their confidence has increased and others say they feel like it's a family. On countless occasions, those who come in our doors are immediately inspired and feel like creating even if they're not artists themselves. Collectively we have over 25,000 followers on social sites alone and have seen our MLoveizm page reach from 2,300 to over 9,100 in the past 2 months. Our reach is core to LA but easily pours over into a worldwide interest with a growing curiosity in Brazil, United Kingdom, Mexico, Italy and more. Although some would say South Central is hopeless, we see something else here, we see the potential. Our core team has shown great personal, technical and business growth just by our meetings alone.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "MLoveizm Magazine facilitates opportunity to build character, expand thought processes, develop business mindsets and think on a deeper level of production in all areas of art to create movement through value and purpose. We focus on the end goal in order to navigate through the lasting importance of their mission by asking “Will it help others?” We do this by connecting, collaborating, encouraging, and taking practical steps forward in personal and business identity, social networking and creating opportunities to become involved in group projects and production that not only create training but jobs and outreach to places beyond South Central’s four walls. We believe art can create revolutions, change minds, touch hearts and provoke action. MLoveizm hopes to cultivate Artists that create art that will do just that. The ripple effect will be endless and to everyone’s benefit not only in LA but everywhere. We hope it starts in LA."

And they're not volunteers, they're participants. Helpers. From homeless people to CEOs, all treated and valued the same. Sometimes the line between who is giving or receiving help is blurred, and we think that's great.

More than that, by bringing people of different worlds together in the name of helping, and focusing on what we have it common, it will be clear what we can accomplish when we work together. Finally, by working to make events impactful, rewarding and fun, we will help build a culture of helping and civic engagement.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "There would be an actual space (picture, say, The Beverly Center) devoted to improving the world. It would include social service agencies; places for people of all ages, as well as groups to volunteer; a food pantry for those who need food and those who want to donate it; what is now Macy's would be a department-store sized high-end thrift store of items of all kinds providing items for both those in need and those wanting a bargain, as well as revenue for a syndicate of nonprofits and jobs for those looking for work; non-profit stores (such as the craft store at the Downtown Women's Center) and for-profit stores (such as Tom's) with a social action mission; restaurants like The Homeboy Cafe, where people who need a second chance to have a good job; the space now housing The Grand Lux would be set up like a German beer hall, with family-style tables where locally grown and raised food would be served to people family style and where people could meet someone new; exhibit and performance spaces for nonprofits, schools and individuals to show their work; gathering spaces for people of all walks of life to congregate not just with their friends, but with different people of all ages and backgrounds for events like concerts or singalongs; a no-kill rescue for stray animals; a rooftop sustainable vegetable garden; classrooms and a lecture hall; and a full programming schedule with ways for people to help, both onsite and throughout the city. This would not be a place for rich people to help poor people. It would be a destination spot, welcoming to all, where people could go knowing they would be able to do their part, large or small, to make the world a better place.",

Then again, we already work with hundreds of partners all over Los Angeles -- schools (all ages, public and private, religious and secular), faith groups, businesses, elected officials, neighborhood councils, civic groups, clubs, alumni groups, teams, nonprofits, and more. Big Sunday has no religious or political agenda and reaches out to and embraces the participation of all groups, provided it's done in a spirit of generosity, understanding, open-mindedness and tolerance.",

On the 10th anniversary of September 11, Big Sunday hosted a food drive and community breakfast. It started at 6:00 a.m., to coincide with the time of the attacks. We collected thousands of pounds of food for pantries, which was nice, but what was great was that the more than 500 helpers included corporate groups; school groups; groups from churches, temples, and a mosque; fraternities and clubs; vets; residents from group homes, including people in recovery and homeless people; and individuals and families. Everyone helped sort and pack the food, and then we all broke bread together. We had a great, donated buffet, and lots of tables set up, with loads of people inside and out, enjoying one another's company on that sad and somber day. And Max turned up. He jumped right in and was great company for everyone he talked. He had a wonderful time, too. Getting Max, the world's most reluctant volunteer to participate, was an excellent achievement. (Next time, we'll get him to bring some food, too.)"

    "summary": "Roosevelt High School is quite possibly one the largest high school in the country with a student body of approximately 5,000 students. It is located in the Boyle Heights area of the City of Los Angeles. The school is known for having violent incidents on campus and students report that they often do not feel safe at school. Boyle Heights is also home to many gangs. While there are local programs such as the Gang Reduction and Youth Development Program that have made some progress, the teens continue to be exposed to various risk factors that might lead to gang affiliation including but not limited to poor parental supervision, negative peer influences, substance use, tagging crews and underlying mental health issue which often are undiagnosed. With the increase in violence and gun violence in schools in this country, this project proposes to provide a 20-week group family sessions in an effort to preventing future violence. The Parent and Child Training Program will raise parent’s awareness of risk factors, warning signs and behaviors that might indicate more serious issues. This program falls under the Prevention and Early Intervention model by providing parents and youth with coping skills as a way of prevention potential incarcerations, school failure or dropout, prolonged suffering, legal problems and removal of children from their homes. These 20-week sessions will be provided to both parents and their children simultaneously. Parents and Youth will meet at the School Site and then break into their two groups which will be lead by their respective group facilitators. At the end of each group discussion a meal will be provided where parents and youth will engage together in a family activity aimed at promoting family bonding, modeling the use of appropriate relational skills and reinforcing concepts introduced during instructional groups. A violence reduction and behavioral modification curriculum will be used to assist youth to identify the roots of violence, how to prevent violent outbursts, increasing their awareness of the connections between alcohol/drugs and violence and ultimately develop better interpersonal and problem solving skills. In other words, teens will discuss a range of topics aimed at increasing their analytical skills, ability to integrate what they learn in real life and learn how to work collaboratively. Simultaneously, a diverse set of problem-solving skills and interventions will be introduced, modeled and role-played with parents. Group instruction will also make way for parents to share their personal struggles, parenting styles and interventions. This Projects’ outcomes include but are not limited to: Projected Outcomes: • Improvement in the quality of the parent-child relationship • Improvement in parenting skills, including positive discipline • Improvement in parent's attitude about parenting • Improvement in the youth’s behavior at home, at school and with peers • Improvement in parents’ self esteem and confidence over their parenting skills • Reduction in risk of child abuse This program will be open for Students from Roosevelt High school and their parents/caregivers. This project is aligned with the ongoing development of a “Super Highway” of services between Roosevelt High School and The Wellness Center at the Historic General Hospital currently being developed by Supervisor Gloria Molina’s office. Alma Family Services will connect students and their families (when appropriate) to additional services provided at the Wellness Center set to open between May and July, 2013. Alma Family Services will be able to screen project participants’ needs and link these individuals/families to the various organizations providing services at the Wellness Center.

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "•\tThis project can be replicated throughout Los Angeles once proven effective at Roosevelt High School. Alma Family Services’ knowledge and track record using different Evidence Based Practices and other Prevention and Early Intervention models has led to significant reduction of risk factors that might lead to violent behavior. Implementation of this program will directly affect Roosevelt High School and the community at large by addressing the roots of violence. Several studies have indicated that violence leads to truancy, lower educational attainment and thus lower level jobs. Also, the psychoemotional and financial cost of violence in schools to poorer families is high, affecting their ability to escape the poverty trap. This project aims at reducing youth’s arrests for crimes including vandalism, trespassing, and tagging. Primary and secondary prevention programs have the potential to generate systemic change. Students will be encouraged to practice cooperation and show responsibility towards their own school and community. Family engagement is critical to promote student achievement. Successful students are more likely to become productive citizens and contribute with their community, the City and County of Los Angeles.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Each school in Los Angeles should implement programs aimed at promoting family engagement, improving school readiness and reducing risk factors that might lead to violence. Our hope is that increasing parental participation in their children’s social and academic lives can become a priority for our schools. It is true that schools alone cannot meet all their student’s needs, specially the needs of students with psycho-emotional issues and/or families dealing with multiple stressors. By facilitating parents’ access to existing networks of service providers, schools will be able to empower these caregivers to take charge of their children’s overall functioning and development. That begins with educating parents on the importance of supporting their children and becoming more involved with the school, community and the different systems of care capable of contributing to students’ success. Educators, parents and community members will be able to build a common understanding of each person’s role in helping students meet academic and social expectations and help students meet their goals.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Alma will measure progress towards goals of this project through participant surveys, track attendance and closely monitor and document each activity of the project to assure that objectives and deliverables are completed according to plan. At enrollment, each student and parent will be interviewed by a case manager who will collaboratively identify goals to be met at the end of the project. 2-3 Behavioral goals will be identify for each student and each parents regarding their academic/social functioning as well as the parent-child relationship. Goals will be reviewed with students and parents individually after 10 weeks and once again at the end of the project. Students will be linked to academic enrichment and recreational activities as way to utilize pro-social skills introduced by this project. Student’s school attendance and report cards will be collected at the beginning and at the end of the program. Case Manager will also collaborate others involved with the student/family such as the school counselor, probation officer and DCFS social worker (if applicable) in order to identify target risk factors that must be further address beyond the group instruction. Surveys will be provided to case workers involved with student/family if applicable.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Alma Family Services was established in 1975 in East Los Angeles by parents to provide, along with other purposes, a comprehensive range of multilingual community based services for those with special needs including emotional, physical and/or developmental delay and their families."

    "summary": "Wildwood Mobile Home Country Club is a mobile home park with an old fairway/golf course connected to it. The fairway has been used as a leach field for the storm water runoff by the neighboring landfill for the last 56 years (unbeknownst to most Wildwood residents). However, it is also a recreation area for the park’s hundreds of residents. On an already contaminated site (an identified EPA superfund site), my idea is to create a built freshwater marsh, bio-swales and walking paths for the residents and wildlife in the area; to transform a 15 acre lawn-monoculture field into a diverse ecology that benefits multiple users and remediates water. This is a multi-step project that will likely require millions of dollars and community input and development. The $100,000 would be used to build an initial bioswale and develop a plan for the full marsh, with the objective of gathering support and finding additional funding. The Community Development Commission of LA (CDC) and County Supervisor Knabe are currently funding a new $4 million Orange Grove Park (5.5 acres) a mile and a half away from Wildwood (Knabe’s website 2013). Considering the environmental negligence towards this site, I seek to bring attention to Wildwood because it is also my home. Wildwood Mobile Home Park has over 360 mobile homes. Squeezed by a railroad and the San Jose Creek to the North and the 60 freeway and La Puente Landfill to the South, the thin site stretches a mile long and shares its slim width with a mostly turf fairway (what used to be a 9 hole golf course). With each mobile home set-up on 1/16th an acre, the fairway serves as the park’s primary green space. Access into the mobile home park is limited to an east entrance making the nearest bike trail and public park half-a-mile and 1.5 miles away travel respectively, leaving the fairway de facto for recreation and exercise. The fairway occupies the north half of the mobile park, which is lower in elevation and only accessible where the transition is not too steep. Thirty foot wide streets with no sidewalks line and lead up to the fairway, sloped so that all the run-off flows onto the grass. The lawn is watered regularly and occasionally inaccessible due to over-saturation, but it’s always green and well manicured by the Wildwood management. The smell on certain days is unbearable, especially on those scorching days. “Smells like spoiled sausage,” as one resident describes it. Walking through the fairway there are three storm drains transporting water runoff from the landfill. “Those tunnels cross under the freeway,” another resident tells me; her twelve-year-old son’s friends took the largest tubular freeway underpass to the other side of the freeway confirming it does. La Puente Landfill is on the other side of the freeway, at 700 acres and 500 feet tall, it is the largest active landfill in the United States (LA County Sanitation District). “It has received approximately 118 million tons of solid waste as of April 2008, raising the original site elevation by over 350 feet and earning it the nickname \"Garbage Mountain\"…takes 13,000 tons of solid waste per day…”(QED Environmental Systems). The dump is the backdrop to Wildwood Park. A closer inspection of Wildwood’s fairway reveals that it is part of the City of Industry while the rest of Wildwood is considered Hacienda Heights; the fairway is zoned Industrial. I wonder how many of the residents at Wildwood know that their fairway annex is actually a means of filtering the toxins from La Puente’s effluence before it enters the San Jose Creek (SJC). The City of Industry is a sliver of a city composed of industrial and commercial properties. A gerrymandered looking city that ranges from one to two miles wide and fourteen miles long, astride the SJC (between the 605 and 57 freeways). Both a natural and now industrialized corridor, perhaps the name says it all. The Puente Valley Operable Unit (PVOU), which includes the City of Industry and Wildwood park, was designated an EPA Superfund Site in 1994—an area with soil and groundwater contamination (with volatile organic compounds or VOCs) (EPA 2008). This is one of four sites in the San Gabriel Valley condemned to superfund status, a clean-up project was planned in 1996 to install extraction wells and a treatment plant system at the mouth of the Puente Creek to limit and reduce toxic exposure for area 4, the PVOU (EPA 2008). Construction began in 2011 in La Puente, three miles NE from Wildwood (EPA 2011). The planned remediation process takes 10-15 years once construction’s completed (EPA 2011). Wildwood is uniquely neglected and requires special attention to help foster an LA that values their residents and their living environmental quality. A concrete swale runs down the center of the fairway now. To start, spend the money converting it into a bioswale with vegetation, rocks, and a trail.",

The areas by the rivers need to become desirable locations that Angelinos flock to that also fosters natural wildlife habitats and native ecologies, which use wetlands to clean water and provide outdoor, activated spaces that people desire to be in. This sometimes conflicts with the overlapping interest that all run along the river. Railroads, freeways, electrical and industrial corridors that also take advantage of the natural ecological corridors, all desire to expand indefinitely; the struggle continues.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "With 35 years of tradition of thorough environmental research and services to municipalities, NGOs, community organizations and other agencies, California Polytechnic University, Pomona's Master in Landscape Architecture's program has the history and the rigor for delving into projects with complex interactions and intersections of natural and human systems. The school has a host of 606 projects on their website for more information.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Walkability, clean water, bio swales and wetland marshes; all attributes of the imagined finished Wildwood Mobile Home Park proposal. Constructed wetlands are designed to imitate the functions of a natural wetland but for the express purpose of cleaning water. Such strategies offer a functional, aesthetic solution; alternatives to the ubiquitous Wildwood fairway lawn that no one should probably sit on. Success would be treating some of the water on site and re mediating the soil. I already had a soil test on the fairway done and the results show the fairway soil is high in chloride and metals and the lab recommends leaching the soil further and to periodically apply nitrogen such as with blood meal, feather meal, fish emulsion, etc."

We desire to provide day camp scholarships to over 1,000 youth ages 5 – 17, in the summer of 2013. From June 10, 2013 to August 9, 2013 over 75,000 youth will register at RAP summer camps that provide youth enrichment activities including but not limited to computer training classes, environmental awareness and education, mentoring, sports, team building, hands-on outdoor and camping activities, arts and crafts, aquatics, fishing, hiking, and life skills. RAP operates American Camping Association (ACA) accredited residential camps at Griffith Park Boys Camp and Camp Hollywoodland for Girls, both situated in one of the largest parks in North America. The majority of our summer day camps are located among our 184 recreation centers that dispersed over 457 square miles of the City of Los Angeles (City) Studies show all children lose ground academically during the summer, and the achievement gap is even more striking for low-income children (Cooper 1996). Richard Rothstein, former national education columnist for The New York Times, and now a research associate with the Economic Policy Institute, agrees \"disadvantaged children get less educational support in summers and after school.\" His research confirms this differential \"summer setback\" occurs partly because middle-class children's learning is reinforced in the summer months — they read more, travel, and learn new social and emotional skills in camps and organized athletics\" (Rothstein 2005). Day camp scholarships will help to close this gap by offering affordable Out of School Time (OST) enrichment programming to youth in Los Angeles during summer vacation months. RAP has over 100 years of programming experience and use models of informal learning opportunities that psychologists and academia are beginning to understand. It is no coincidence that the Latin word “campus” (field) reveals the link between school campuses and campsites. These two institutions not only share a common root, but together account for countless hours of engagement and influential experience for American children and adults (Ozier, 2010). Dr. Edmund Gordon, one of the founders of the Head Start Program contends supplemental educational experiences are vital to all children and are closely associated with \"exposure to family and community-based activities and learning experiences that occur both in and out of school\" (Gordon 2005).",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "This scholarship program will allow more than 1,000 youth to attend summer camp in 2013, who otherwise would not have this opportunity. The impact will be realized throughout the City of Los Angeles, with the majority of scholarships being allocated among summer camps located at RAP recreation centers located within economically disadvantaged communities, and for youth to experience a week long overnight camp at one of our two residential camps. The 2005 and 2006 the American Community Survey revealed that 20% of the City met the Federal guidelines for poverty, with a 29% child poverty rate. Approximately 80% of Los Angeles Unified School District students qualify for free or reduced price meals.

    "summary": "One of over 4,300 Boys & Girls Clubs, our collective mission is to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. We accomplish our mission by providing a safe haven away from negative influences; an ongoing relationship with trained, caring adult role models; constructive, supervised programs that are sensitive to the needs of youth at-risk; guidance and encouragement in educational and career endeavors; positive programs that encourage strong values, self-esteem and a healthy lifestyle; a solid gang prevention and intervention initiative; a vision of life beyond adolescence; facilitation and reinforcement of a positive peer group environment; and family support. Our vision for the new Learning Center is to create a fun, stimulating environment, rich with technology, resources and opportunities that inspires learning. The new Learning Center will enable us to increase capacity, improve and expand our programs and continue to provide youth with the resources they need to build a solid platform to reach their full potential. To meet these needs, we have developed a multi-phased plan. The first three phases are renovating the following areas: main learning center, digital library/leadership room, and technology lab. The plans for the renovation project include: •Creating a synergy of existing spaces that will enhance the learning experience and supports educational success; •Increase access to technology, resources, opportunities and educational support; •Provide highly flexible spaces to encourage the constantly changing learning environment; •Incorporate a sustainable design to support energy-efficiency. As incredible as our facility is, our Learning Center is over-utilized and we have not fully accommodated for growth. We feel this inadequacy in every aspect of our core programs. Renovation and expansion of the Club’s Learning Center will enable the following: •A “learning center” where tutors and volunteers from the community can be matched to youth in need of additional educational help. Our members need a quiet place to do their homework after-school and there are few “quiet areas” where students can concentrate on schoolwork. Individual study carrels will allow privacy and study tables can be rearranged to accommodate groups. •Locker storage space: Currently there are no lockers storing personal items. On any given day, one can walk into the Learning Center and find walls lined with backpacks, books, and coats of dozens of youth that have no space to store these items. •A computer lab where youth could become more familiar with emerging technologies. Currently, 70% of our members are without computer and internet access at home and without home access students struggle to complete their homework causing them to fall further behind. The expansion of a computer lab would take the first step in addressing this need. •A meeting room where club members could meet with staff and adult mentors to discuss school performance. The Club’s group character and leadership groups would use the room for their meetings and to assist in planning community service activities. •Kindle books have now overtaken paperback books and the trend towards digital books is one that cannot be ignored and we are committed to maintain relevance in an ever-changing digital environment. Year-round reading programs and family literacy programs will be hosted in our new digital library.",

To monitor our success in facilitating this inclusion, we plan to keep a scorecard of participation through all three phases, tracking the number of people in the workshops and levels of participant satisfaction, to ensure the community felt their voices were heard. We plan to use several engagement tactics with a goal of reaching at least 2,000 participants through workshop attendance and surveys. For process improvement, we will include feedback loops between attendees and facilitators. We will use evaluation surveys for input after each session to understand what exercises were successful and effective. To ensure successful product delivery, the exhibition will include a participatory element that will allow the public to comment, critique, and enrich the conversation.

The Star Apartments, currently under construction, builds on our successes by pushing innovations in social service delivery, architectural design, and construction. The Star will be the home to 100 formerly homeless individuals. In addition to a full medical clinic on the ground floor, the Department of Health Services will be headquartered on-site. By implementing pre-fabricated modular housing, the project uses new construction methods for cost-savings and time-efficient construction.

The RSG! mission is to increase the state-mandated Fitnessgram scores and promote student fitness, nutrition and a healthy lifetime lifestyle in the 5th, 7th and 9th grade physical education classes which are required to take the Fitnessgram test annually. Each Olympian/Paralympian is matched to a specific school and meets with their students five - six times during the school year to inspire, educate, empower, and motivate them toward a long and healthy life. Like tobacco cessation and seat belt use, this is a long-term problem we are addressing. According to the LA Department of Public Health in 2007, over 440,500 of LAUSD's 5th, 7th and 9th graders were obese (having too much body fat). Obese children have a greater likelihood of developing risk factors associated with chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease which often follow children into adulthood. Some populations are at higher risk: low-income individuals, African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans which reflect the LAUSD student population: 73% Latino, 11% Black/African, 9% White, 4% Asian and 3% American Indian/Native American. In addition to the above health disparities, LAUSD has cut back on physical education (PE) in elementary schools, decreased the number of credentialed PE teachers and increased PE class sizes to 40-50-60 students. RSG! was designed to supplement and operate in existing PE classes for the 5th, 7th and 9th graders with teachers and Olympians providing the encouragement and drive to be knowledgeable about health, fitness and nutrition as important elements toward a long and healthy life.

With voter turnout correlated to education levels, Los Angeles is losing the voice of an entire segment of people.\n\nLA2050 Youth 4C will remove barriers that prevent civic engagement by going directly into alternative education charter schools in underserved communities to train students as grassroots leaders and advocates for community change. Over 70 students from 7 different areas in Los Angeles will be given the training and tools needed to effectively engage their peers and parents to have a voice in policy by leading campaigns in their own schools and communities. The LA2050 Youth 4C Leaders will mobilize thousands of individuals to participate in civic engagement, and for many, provide them their first experience in politics.\n\nThe LA2050 Youth 4C Initiative brings forward a new uprising of young leaders to encourage civic engagement today and help change the culture of participation for the future. The LA2050 Youth 4C Initiative is a 6-month training program that is comprised of 5 components: 1) the development and implementation of a mini-campaign at each of the seven schools; 2) production of a LA2050 Youth 4C YouTube channel that documents and share the videos of hundreds of youth discussing the issues they face; 3) a collaboration of the Youth 4C Leaders to plan and host a Back to School Conference for 2000 area students, 4) educate and engage parents at Open House sessions, and 5) leading a LA2050 Youth 4C Advocacy Day at City Hall.\n\nYouth 4C will partner with alternative charter schools to identify and recruit 7-10 student leaders from each of the following areas: Compton, Huntington Park, Watts, Culver City, East LA, Hoover, & Hawthorne. Each group of student leaders will work as a team to develop and implement a mini-campaign at their school that focuses on one policy issue that affects their lives as students. Topics can include but are not limited to gang violence, teen pregnancy, foster care, substance abuse, access to resources, or bullying. All students will come together for monthly trainings in leadership, community organizing, and advocacy, as well as to provide a forum for discussion and support for each other’s campaigns.\n\nAfter months of planning, Youth 4C Leaders will introduce their campaign at a Back to School Conference of 2000 area students. Each Youth 4C Leadership team will present their campaign to the entire conference. Each leadership team will also have a booth at the conference, allowing students to talk one on one about the issue, share campaign messages, and have supporters sign their petitions. Over the next two months, each student leadership group will embark on a community campaign at their school to gain support, have petitions signed, and to create Video Voice Mapping footage. Video Voice Mapping (VVM) is a new advocacy tool where students record themselves performing self-interviews that discusses where there are, an environmental or policy issue that is affecting them, and what they would like done about it. All videos will be placed on a newly created LA2050 Youth 4C YouTube channel that can be promoted throughout Los Angeles. Each Youth 4C Leader will perform their own VVM Interview and be responsible for interviewing 5 other students or community members. Students will also engage parents at Open House sessions, where parents will be invited to sign petitions and participate in video interviews.\n\nAs a capstone of the campaign, the student leaders will plan and host a LA2050 Youth 4C Advocacy Day at City Hall. Student leaders, friends, family members, and community supporters will come together on the steps of City Hall to show support for the future of social connectedness and civic engagement in LA.

The station serves a moderately dense residential area, with pedestrian traffic around the station throughout the day, and heavy pedestrian traffic at rush hour. The Pop-Up Produce Station will be a community resource besides offering access to nutritious produce by providing work and job training opportunities for neighborhood residents."

Most are low-income minorities, and all are at high risk of dropping out for good. Our students have experienced high levels of transience and failure, perceive a lack of future possibilities, and have difficulty recognizing the value of their contributions and connection to others.

The tool measures students’ progress over time across multiple learning outcomes: social learning, aesthetic/creative learning, subject-based/content learning, and school and community learning. These outcomes correlate with preparedness for the 21st century creative economy as well as dropout prevention risk reduction.

    "slug": "2013/jumpstart-preschool-changes-everything",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Jumpstart For Young Children, Inc.",
    "summary": "Over 20,000 Angelinos enter the modern economy every year without a high school degree. It is simply unacceptable that in a city as wealthy and vibrant as ours, countless children go their entire lives without receiving an adequate education. It’s not just that they are not reaching their potential; they are not even coming close. As a community, we are failing these children. Think that’s scary? Now consider this. Many children are already so far behind by the age of five (no, that’s not a typo), that they are unlikely ever to catch up. This is nothing less than a catastrophe. Children whose parents have a low-income begin kindergarten up to 60% behind their more affluent peers – and 74% of the LAUSD student body is economically disadvantaged. The only silver lining in this heartbreaking story is that we have already discovered the most impactful, cost-effective solution to this problem devastating our city. The answer is high-quality early education. Investments in high-quality early education transform lives and yield extraordinary social returns. This has been validated by extensive academic research and highlighted by leading policymakers. For example, according to the seminal High/Scope Perry Preschool Study, children who participate in high-quality early education programs are more likely to read at grade level, thrive in school, and graduate than those who do not. They are also less likely to become involved with the justice system or need special instruction, which means that, according to University of Chicago economist and Nobel Laureate, James Heckman, every dollar invested in early childhood education produces a 10% annual return for the life of the child. During his February 13 State of the Union Address, President Obama cited such studies to underscore the powerful impact of investments in high-quality early education. There are two major problems when it comes to early education in Los Angeles: access and quality. Later in this proposal we discuss how we think that, together with the Goldhirsh Foundation, we can generate the political will to advance the issue of access for all children. But universal access is not enough. Most children who attend preschool and whose parents have a low-income attend either federally-funded Head Start preschools or state-funded preschools that are under-resourced, and as a result have a lower level of quality. They have high child-to-adult ratios and do not have as many books and learning resources as they should. In addition, low salaries compel many excellent preschool teachers to leave the profession to pursue careers that offer a living wage. Our focus is on these children, who are in preschool, but need additional support to have experiences comparable to those that middle-class and affluent kids have. These children cannot wait for universal access; they need a first-class education today. Jumpstart is a remarkable public-private partnership that leverages the resources of government agencies, LA’s leading foundations, cutting-edge corporations, universities, and preschools to provide high-quality early education to children and families who need it most – and it only costs $2,000 per child. Jumpstart’s proposal is to implement one semester of the Jumpstart program in five Los Angeles preschool classrooms. Here’s how it works. Step 1: We identify preschools that serve children whose parents have low-incomes because we know that family income is a leading indicator of children’s readiness for kindergarten. The lower your family’s income, the less likely you will be ready for school. Furthermore, children whose parents have a low-income are more likely to attend schools that are ill-equipped to meet their needs. Step 2: We collaborate with nearby universities. Why universities? Because universities have motivated, passionate students who have the capacity to give back. Step 3: We train our college-student volunteers – nearly 400 of them in LA County and 78 at UCLA – to implement Jumpstart’s highly intentional, research-based program. Jumpstart’s curriculum, which reflects best practices in early childhood education and has been informed by 20 years of experience – is targeted to develop the language, literacy, and social skills that children need to begin kindergarten prepared to succeed. What else do we need besides a proven curriculum and talented adults with the time and motivation to help children? Step 4: Money! It’s always time and money, isn’t it? Through partnerships with AmeriCorps and the Federal Work Study program, we pay a significant portion of our program costs with dollars that have already been allocated to support college students – and we maximize those public investments by putting them where they can have the greatest impact: high-quality early education. Want to know the best part? Our program works. Children who receive the Jumpstart program have outperformed a comparison group for 10 years.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "If you attended a well-resourced preschool as a child, then success in the year 2050 will look a lot like you. One hundred children will have received a semester of high-quality early education and, as a result, they are more likely to have gone on to graduate from high school, attend college, and live healthy, productive lives. There is overwhelming evidence that high-quality early education has this kind of impact, and that, as a result, society as a whole benefits from having better citizens, smarter workers, and stronger families.",

    "summary": "What if that broad expanse of grass in your local community was instead producing healthy, nutritious, organic fruits and vegetables? Our project is about empowering citizens to turn the under-utilized spaces around them into productive gardens: public spaces where people can learn, gather, and share. Food gardens can be beautiful nature spaces within our concrete-bound city. Community gardens can provide gathering places in a city that doesn't have much public open space. Public gardens can be places to meet your neighbors and work together; they are centers for learning, for arts and culture, and for a new sense of community. Gardening is enticing, fun, approachable, and accessible to multiple demographics. It builds health through exercise and stretching, sunshine and fresh air, and promotes healthy eating with fresh, organic, local, clean, unprocessed food. In these times of ongoing economic contraction and resource limitations, learning the skills of growing food is a necessary skill for survival. Community gardening provides an excellent vehicle for much broader lessons about environmental stewardship and social dynamics. Organic gardening opens the door to much-needed conversations about pollutants, toxins, consumerism, and activism. It cultivates new perspectives on humanity's place within the earth's ecosystems. Our project is about **changing minds**, which then inspires people to change their habits, surroundings, and environment. Our proposal consists of three parts: 1) Growing gardeners. Through experience, we understand that “more community gardens” is not simply a matter of more physical construction and installation. Rather, we must grow the skill-base to maintain the spaces we create. We propose to offer a series of \"Organic Vegetable Gardening\" classes for the general public at multiple locations around the greater LA area. Our unique approach to gardening education integrates organics, permaculture, saner resource consumption, and ecosystems awareness. We integrate food gardening with environmental transformation. 2) Growing gardens. The grant would make it possible for ECM to mentor several community groups* who are contemplating the installation of community gardens like ours. We can guide these prospective community garden groups, based upon our experiences of what works/doesn’t work; help them find resources; match landholders with knowledgeable local food gardeners; give them a helping start with garden design to create beautiful, artful, and healthful open spaces; help them learn how to make the most out of minimal inputs, available onsite materials, and shoestring construction budgets; help them establish and grow a local leadership team. *(specific sites are currently being identified by our networking partners) 3) Growing root-level change. To deepen environmental transformation, we would host a training about a much more panoramic view of change. The Transition training (a) raises awareness of the sweeping implications of peak oil, climate change, resource limitations, and the economic crisis, (b) helps participants grasp the vast number of things that can be done at the grassroots level to prepare for such a future, and (c) trains participants to be community leaders for this preparedness effort. It includes training on community empowerment, evolved group dynamics, economic solutions, and the psychological implications of the massive changes humanity faces. We propose to bring trainers from Transition US (the national representative of the international Transition Network) to Los Angeles, to train leaders and help additional local neighborhoods start neighborhood action groups. Grant funding would make this training accessible to low income participants in less-affluent areas of our megacity, so that post-petroleum preparedness can get underway on a widespread basis.",

In 2013, many artists cannot afford to live in the “artist district”, because the rent is so high. Please follow me as I speak as if my idea is already a reality: In downtown Los Angeles, there is a 128-unit building that is filled with musicians, and people who promote the music they generate. 22 floors of cats. The building has a house jazz orchestra, a house symphonic orchestra, and daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra. There are also dozens of offshoot groups. Every month, they give a concert that costs five bucks to see. Everyone who lives there teaches privately for ten bucks a lesson. There is a concert hall, and a café on the ground floor. The sound of tenant recitals fill the air. Every performance is recorded, filmed, and streamed around the world. In exchange for $400.00/month rent, each musician provides a ten-day/month commitment to rehearsal, performance, recitals, private lessons, and recording sessions. In the course of a year, the people who live there generated four hundred CDs worth of recorded music. House of daKAH cats. daKAT House. Like I said, this proposal follows the \"Twobird/Onestone\" theory of social policy. As we get deeper into the 21st century, it's getting more important to find ways to cover a coupla bases with one paycheck. We impact two indicators by providing affordable housing to a focused group of people who will enrich the musical landscape of the city. PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT FOR MUSICIANS The first step in my idea is to partner with an existing non-profit housing organization, (or an individual who can create one), that can apply to HUD on our behalf. As a full-time musician, I am talking in vague terms about laws and regulations that I know nothing about. I am confident that someone with knowledge of this terrain will be able to navigate through the various housing programs that are available through the federal government that would support this approach to housing. At first glance, an Artist-Based public housing project could exploit a combination of Section 8 tenant status, a Section 107 Community Development Block Grant, Section 3 Economic Opportunities, Section 221 Multifamily Rental Status and Section 213 Cooperative Housing programs. The process of finding musicians to live in the building is a combination of an orchestra audition, applying for an O-1 Artist Visa and an application for Section 8 housing. We aren’t looking for rich people who want to pay cheap rent. We are looking for musicians, at any phase in their career, who need a break on the rent. In addition to financial need, each tenant must demonstrate exceptional ability on their instrument. Each tenant is also required to stay in L.A. during the term of their lease at daKAT House.

    "summary": "We want to build a startup incubator program in East LA to foster entrepreneurship in underserved communities that have low access to technology and startup resources. ****** Los Angeles has been ranked the #3 startup city in the world, behind San Francisco and Tel Aviv! However, the LA tech ecosystem is concentrated in more affluent areas such as Santa Monica, Venice and West Hollywood. Meanwhile, East LA is an area with a rich history of makers and creators, and with just as much entrepreneurial spirit. Yet it lacks the resources needed to tap into the local tech startup scene. ****** By bringing this startup incubator program to East LA, we are fostering local talent and providing top-notch education and mentorship from successful entrepreneurs. This will bring valuable jobs and job skills to underserved communities. Not only does this help to uplift a struggling neighborhood, but it creates a better overall startup ecosystem for the entire city of Los Angeles – by creating a larger pool of talent coming from diverse backgrounds and walks of life. ****** Our startup incubator program will provide the following to East LA communities: ****** EDUCATION: Provide classes in entrepreneurship (such as how to formulate a business plan, how to pitch a VC, how to use social media, legal and accounting seminars etc) and relevant tech skills such as coding, web development, UX design, graphic design and more. ****** MENTORSHIP: Provide a forum for mentorship between local aspiring entrepreneurs and experienced business experts. Our team is well-connected to the LA tech, entertainment, and investment communities, which will provide an endless source of mentorship. ****** PROFESSIONAL NETWORKING: We hope to create a network of skilled professionals who are capable of joining or creating jobs in tech and startups. We will provide a platform for networking with each other, and with tech companies and startups from all over LA. ****** WORK SPACE: Provide coworking/office space at low cost to locally-focused startups. Our facility will be the historic Casa Del Mexicano building in Boyle Heights, East LA. The i.am.angel Foundation is currently renovating the building to turn it into a state-of-the-art community center, which will also house other programs in STEM and Arts education. It will be a perfect space for the cross-pollination of ideas that leads to innovation! ****** CAPITAL: Provide seed funding for startups that fit certain criteria, such as startups that are focused locally on the East LA community, or startups that promote social good. By the end of 2013, we hope to identify and support 5 local startups in East LA with $10,000 each in seed funding.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In the year 2050, the LA tech and startup communities will look a lot more like LA itself: culturally diverse, rich in differing talent, opinions, backgrounds, and walks of life. LA will be a true breeding ground for innovation. There will also be greater focus on companies that produce sustainable and social good. LA will also be home to stronger communities with vibrant local economies that match the unique culture of each. Our vision is that the i.am.angel incubator model will have hubs in various communities all over Los Angeles."

    "organization": "Friends, the Foundation of the California African American Museum",
    "summary": "We propose to integrate 4 tracks of existing and new activity initiatives for greater depth, synergistic connections and “doing more better” for our youth and community as follows: Young Docents and Young Docents After Hours - continuing and deepening the experience for LA County high school students to receive paid employment and training through hands-on cross use customer service business, public speaking and problem solving skills plus direct experience of museum operations, and program development and delivery. Artpreneurs program enhancement with 10 increased opportunities for participation and promotion fostering creative and economic vitality for visual artists through monthly on-site vending and marketing opportunities to the public. Kids Gloves project to be tested with our YDs to empower learning and pride in uncovering school and neighborhood history through professional experiences in cataloging & preserving historical artifacts, gathering oral histories and determining if we can replicate the program for at schools throughout Los Angeles. Art on CAAM’s Footprint program which is a 2 year program designed to develop deeper community based relationships and engagement in the placement, curation and creation of CAAM’s exterior footprint as a “gallery” for public exhibition For 6 months we would blend and cross purpose these initiatives for a more integrated and richer public, experience for both our youth, audiences, general public that will not only meet the arts and cultural vitality indicators, but also serve as boosters for education, social connections, and provide direct impact on income and employment for area youth as well as the overall enhancement of the physical Exposition Park neighborhood and environment.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "For the Young Docents we have evaluation forms that are regularly used to assess the individual students and the program as a whole. Students keep journals, are tested on information, given feedback and opportunities to lead tours, assist guests and engage in other projects and research. We determine success by not only the number of students that complete the summer portion of the program, but by the increased number of students that want to return for the year long portion of the program. The increased number of applications further advises us that there is a need and we seek advise from consultants and specialists for improvements. The deeper offerings centered around graphic design, AV tech training, social media protocols and direct engagement with the community for the YD participants under this grant would be scrutinized in the same manner.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Role of Partners in Planning and Implementation (if any): The California African American Museum (a State Agency) provides the facility, utilities, equipment and co-workers that drive our mission; Funding Donors, such as Target, Bank of America, Annenberg Foundation, Department of Cultural Affairs, Los Angeles County Arts Commission, SEMPRA Energy, SCE and others generously fund programs through our Friends Foundation; People of the African Diaspora, African American Artists, Collectors, History Makers and Gallery Owners who through their need, support and participation drive our mission and increased the demand for continued growth and vitality.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "By 2050 we fully expect CAAM to have moved into its expanded 172,000 sq ft facility that will provide better storage, classrooms, multi-use presentation spaces, a larger library and exhibition galleries as well as greatly improved physical presence in the park and in the neighborhood. However, we are driven first by further providing the content and programs that we think are vital to our relationship in this neighborhood. We seek to have strong give back programs like the ones we describe in this application to be a part of our base of operations in the same way that we began our Young Docents program16 years ago with only 2 students being served. We will remain responsible for employing our youth, providing Art on the Footprint so as to create changing and engaging experiences for our Park users. Even pieces created today will be a part of our collection and the history of our neighborhood. Our Kid Gloves project will be a regular part of school education outreach efforts as new generations of students need to remain connected to their school community, even if they are bused into the area. Success for CAAM is a full integration of all of the multi-facets of art and culture, education, employment and income, and neighborhood enhancement…these are the elements served by our mission but expanded upon to include even greater community input and involvement.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Despite the economic downturn and budget reductions we have grown attendance at CAAM over the last 10 years from35K to over 100,000 visitors representing an average 20% increase each year. We are now presenting 80+ public programs each year and 9 – 13 exhibitions while continuing to maintain an active and growing research library and collection. We are proud of these numbers and equally as proud that they represent a connection to content that has ranged from presenting the more than 20 exhibitions that have been directly related to telling the story of the African Diaspora around the world…and all still for Free Admission! We have proudly collaborated with numerous organizations from the Skirball Cultural Center to the Japanese American National Museum, the Chinese American Museum and others like Self Help Graphics to the obvious connections with the Watts Towers, St. Elmo’s Village, and commercial galleries owned by African Americans. We encourage artmaking and training by children and showcase the work of other organizations serving this purpose like Ryman Arts. But perhaps we are just as proud of our outreach efforts with Target that were designed to allow us to showcase the achievements and contributions of the African American and collaborative communities through our Target Sundays at CAAM programs. Through this effort, we have not only created places for the community to showcase what they do but this showcasing of talent also included bringing to the public important discussions and representatives that could assist with everything from healthy living to safety in the water. Target Sundays even helped us create our Artpreneur program making it possible for solo art entrepreneurs to have a place to sell and expose audiences to their work and earn income accordingly. Our most heartfelt achievement is the growth of our Young Docents program having grown it from a 2 person 4 week program that is an integral part of our program today employing, training and educating 30 high school youth year round for their personal and professional career development.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Some suggest that museum’s have largely supplanted churches as institutions that are emblematic of American cities. For the California African American (CAAM), situated in the heart of LA, this is idea applies as related to the on-going challenge of engaging a multiplicity of demographics and subjects matters. At CAAM we go beyond daily programming to invest in developing human infrastructures and relationships that will serve the unmet needs of the local and larger community, and bring together the experiences of generations. It is in this context that we seek support for our multifaceted vision to “Dig Deeper, Connect the Dots & Do More.”"

    "slug": "2013/advancement-project-safe-streets-for-watts-students",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Advancement Project California",
    "summary": "Advancement Project’s Urban Peace program believes that all children have the right to walk to and from school without the fear of gang intimidation or violence. However, in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, families and students are fearful to travel outside of their homes to attend school, play in the local parks, and frequent neighborhood stores. Children living in public housing developments are unable walk to and from school safely because of harassment and intimidation by competing gangs who are actively recruiting in and near schools. Local parks and gyms are usually unsafe and often claimed by local gangs, so some of the few recreational spaces for low-income families to engage in physical activity are not being utilized. Urban Peace’s Community Safety Scorecard: City of Los Angeles 2011 reveals that the Watts community ranks as one of the top 10 most dangerous zip codes in Los Angeles with an “F” ranking for safety. Thankfully, Urban Peace is now turning the tide in Watts, creating a safe environment for children to walk to school, ride their bikes, and for families to visit local parks. Our Safe Routes to School initiative will use innovative strategies to reduce crime, violence, and bullying along popular school travel routes. This initiative will unite community member volunteers, educators, local law enforcement officials and public housing officials to ensure that students can walk safely to school. The goal of our Safe Routes to School effort will be that students and families will be safe traveling to school, in school, and home from school. Through Safe Routes to School, our initiative will reduce chronic absenteeism that results from safety concerns and improve student access to safe after school alternatives. As part of Urban Peace’s comprehensive violence reduction strategy in Watts, the Safe Routes to School initiative will build on Urban Peace’s leadership of the Community Safety Partnership, a historic joint effort that has created unprecedented partnerships between public housing officials, law enforcement officers, and community members around a comprehensive violence reduction strategy. Our efforts will directly improve student safety, as well as increase opportunities for children and families to safely travel through their neighborhood. Take Blanca, a gifted science student living in Watts public housing who hopes to become a doctor one day. She has supportive parents and works diligently to complete her homework each night. However, as soon as she steps out of her front door to travel to school, she remembers the gang shootings she witnessed last year on her block. Many of her friends suffer PTSD symptoms from witnessing chronic violence. Blanca is halfway through eighth grade, and she is already intimidated by the gang members that try to recruit her at the park, and is even more fearful to face them on a daily basis on her walk to school. The school Blanca needs to pursue her dreams seems simply too risky and too dangerous for her to attend. However, the Safe Routes to School initiative envisions eliminating the fear and intimidation that students like Blanca, and 3,000 like her in Watts face. When the Safe Routes to School initiative is implemented during the 2013-14 school year, Blanca’s walk to school will be transformed. Instead of having to avoid gang violence, Blanca will see a friendly neighborhood mother asking her how her test went last week. On a corner that she was once too afraid to cross, Blanca will instead pass a familiar police officer working with a trusted community gang intervention worker, both working to ensure students' safety. Upon arriving at school, Blanca will be greeted by a trained teacher and gang intervention worker who have taught her strategies to avoid joining a gang and encouraged her to pursue her dreams to become a doctor. Her teachers will have received violence prevention training and will listen and respond to her campus safety concerns including bullying and intimidation from her peers with appropriate and timely interventions. Because of the support of so many community members, Blanca will now have the confidence to stay after school to attend a study group and her family will feel safe when playing a soccer game at a local park in the evening. As a result of our efforts, children like Blanca will not only have the freedom to attend and succeed in school without fears of gang intimidation and violence, but the entire safety of their community will also be improved. Leveraging our ongoing efforts to improve community safety through our leadership of the Watts Community Safety Partnership, we are confident that the integration of a Safe Routes to School initiative will reduce violent crimes to historically low levels in the Watts community and create safe public spaces for Watts families to engage in physical activities.",
    "goal": null,
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "As a result of Urban Peace’s leadership of the Community Safety Partnership in Watts, violent crime has dropped by 53% to 75% within each of the three Watts housing developments over that past year. Law enforcement officials are thrilled by the reduced crime statistics, citing that there has not been a single homicide in the Watts housing developments since August 2011. Community members have reported that residents are now feeling more safe to travel and frequent stores within their community, and there have been notable decreases in youth gang membership and activity. While we are proud of our work in Watts, the Urban Peace program has also had a profound effect in improving community safety throughout Los Angeles.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Urban Peace will work with a variety of public and private stakeholders to implement the Safe Routes to School initiative over the next year. These partners include the LAPD and HACLA, as well as the City of Los Angeles Office of Gang Reduction and Youth Development (GRYD). In addition, we will engage community stakeholders who will act as volunteers to monitor crime hotspots at peak school arrival and dismissal times, train gang intervention workers to assist in our efforts, and partner with local schools to help implement violence prevention strategies.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The goal of our Safe Routes to School initiative is to improve community safety so that more students are walking to school safely and families can access public spaces for physical activity. Urban Peace will actively collect and analyze data throughout our Safe Routes to School initiative to determine its impact on increasing safety within the Watts community over a five year period. We believe success will be demonstrated through decreased levels of gang violence, as well as an increase in the number of students attending school, and families engaging in physical activity.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Advancement Project’s Safe Routes to School initiative will greatly benefit the Los Angeles community by increasing public safety in one the city’s most violent and poor neighborhoods. We expect that our Safe Routes to School initiative will not only lead to increased student safety in and around schools, but also increased school attendance and decreased dropout rates over five years. Our Safe Routes to School effort will compliment Urban Peace’s leadership of the Community Safety Partnership in Watts, where we provide technical assistance to the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) and the LAPD to implement a historic and joint community safety plan.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In 2050, Urban Peace envisions that Los Angeles has evolved from the gang capital of the country to one of the nation’s safest large cities. We believe Watts can become as safe of a neighborhood as Bel Air. While this future may seem like an unrealistic goal, we believe that if law enforcement and community members continue to work in partnership to implement a comprehensive violence reduction strategy, gang violence can be eradicated even in Los Angeles’ poorest communities. Our hope is all residents, regardless of income level or the socioeconomic status of their neighborhood, feel safe from violence and crime."

    "title": "Building Bridges in the San Gabriel Valley: Social Connectedness in Action",
    "slug": "2013/building-bridges-in-the-san-gabriel-valley-social-connectedness-in-action",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "St. John the Baptist Social Services",
    "summary": "The San Gabriel Valley currently lacks solid social connectedness; this project aims to change this dynamic. First, the area, like much of Los Angeles is experiencing demographic changes. This is definitely true in the San Gabriel Valley as newly arriving Latinos and Asian-Pacific Islanders mix with existing 2nd-5th Generation Latinos. This project seeks to alleviate some of the tensions change can bring by starting dialogues and workshops led by established professional facilitators. These dialogues seek to bring different cultures with very different experiences and expectations for life in the San Gabriel Valley and Los Angeles together in order to connect and work together, rather than exist in clusters individually. The idea is to use methods similar to successful “black-brown” projects in Los Angeles and make them relevant to the region and its needs. The dialogues would be adapted for language needs. This segment will be aided by previous experience working with NCCJ (National Conference for Community & Justice). The first step in growing connectedness is to have different groups actually connect; this project begins those linkages. The second area of the project to expand social connectedness is to partner with LA Voice in expanding the region. Currently, LA Voice has many strong clusters in Los Angeles; but, it has a lone operation in the San Gabriel Valley (in Baldwin Park). This project sees the formation of a regional base and expansion into many more congregations. LA Voice’s expansion would greatly aid social connectedness. In individual congregations, it would create opportunities for individuals to learn how to gain influence and change their communities. Regional meetings would bring these congregations together in actions and planning sessions, which grow area connectedness. LA Voice’s network across Los Angeles provides further opportunities for connectedness at meetings and actions. This effect is further amplified with statewide conferences of the PICO Network which will allow San Gabriel Valley residents to develop ideas and learn from other Californians beyond relying on emails or news reports. The third segment is the hosting of events to grow social connectedness. For example, preparations are underway for a higher education presentation that would include universities, counselors, immigration assistance, and local successful graduates, including a commitment from a locally-raised government official currently working in Washington, D.C. With ongoing budget cuts and cultural issues, an event held independently of school has very significant promise to connect a wide pool of potential candidates to resources needed to attend higher education. Hosting “get acquainted” meetings for local businesses, politicians, and leaders is designed to provide non-confrontational opportunities for contact among what has been at time a contentious environment rather than confrontational or negotiating situations. The project also sees quarterly men’s and women’s contact group meetings to discuss issues they feel are pertinent. Citizenship events are another key component. These events help residents move from residency through the application process and examinations to full Unietd States citizenship. The citizenship steps also introduce people to “the system” and strongly encourage voting and voter awareness of issues. These events ranging from higher education awareness to more regular contact sessions and promote new linkages for the area. The fourth area is training to improve social connectedness. Training will make presentations, events, and communications more effective. The training will include making sue of technology to improve presentations. Staff development will also help the program deal with the community changes already discussed. The project also plans to send teens to leadership development training. In this area youth leadership is often not fully nourished; the goal of the training is to have youth involved and to prepare them for greater success. The fifth area to improve social connectedness is capability upgrades through technology and equipment. Currently, the Social Services program relies on “low tech” communications. This project sees program gaining a major boost in long-term capability to connect with society through laptop computers, a scanner, PowerPoint projectors, significantly upgraded telephones to allow for more efficient phone banks, and data transfer equipment. The equipment upgrades will make communications more effective. For example, a bilingual PowerPoint presentation in Asian-Pacific Islander-Hispanic dialogues will now be possible. Likewise, non-partisan voting telephone reminders will be far easier to perform with upgrades. Communication improvements will literally boost social connectedness. Social Connectedness is a complex concept; improving social connectedness is even more challenging. This project faces the challenge.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "This project is not solely a project where simple headcounts or signatures on a page are the signs of success; this project will be accountable beyond statistics.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "St. John the Baptist Social Service has a long history of involvement in the community, aiding those in need. The program has been meeting the many economic, physical, and societal needs of the community and successfully adjusting to changes in the area since 194.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The project seeks to use diverse partnerships to improve its reach and effectiveness.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "This project boosts social connectedness in the San Gabriel Valley, an area of Los Angeles County trailing in linkages. Away from many economic and government power centers, the region has been semi-isolated among its own cities and regionally. Like in a body, an atrophied region is a problem for an area; this project looks to add muscle and flexibility to an underdeveloped part of the Greater Los Angeles body.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The San Gabriel Valley is a much more socially connected area in 2050 than the 2010s. The region maintains its distinctiveness while now also being much more linked to the rest of Greater Los Angeles. This social connectedness has made for a more involved and aware populace, more efficient and transparent government, and for greater economic opportunity."

    "slug": "2013/young-leaders-for-a-healthy-la",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Young Invincibles",
    "summary": "Young Invincibles (YI) is an organization that expands opportunities for young adults between the ages of 18 and 34, with a primary focus on health care. YI creates targeted policy, research, and education campaigns that engage young adults and policymakers, and has become the most prominent national youth voice around young adults and health care, with offices and staff in LA and DC. Young adults are a key population to target as CA moves toward implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This demographic is disproportionately un- and underinsured, and often lacks both health homes and consistent care. YI recognizes the needs of young consumers and the importance of getting “young invincibles” informed and insured. New Exchanges also rely on the participation of the younger, healthier population to succeed and bring down costs for everyone. For many young people, a cell phone is a critical part of everyday life. Connecting with friends, finding directions, getting advice - it all happens on a cell phone. While 25% of smartphone users overall use their phone as their primary Internet access point, 42% of young adults, 38% of African Americans, and 40% of Latinos, go online mostly using their cell phones. In order to reach young adults where they are, YI has developed a free smartphone application, called Health Care Finder – Los Angeles, which easily disseminates health information to young adults in Los Angeles. The application educates users on available health providers, contains FAQ’s about the ACA, and gives information about different health insurance options. The app will also include a direct connection to the new California exchange where low-income youth can get Medi-Cal or subsidies for more affordable coverage, as well as push notification reminders around health services and enrollment. The app is already available on a range of smartphones and is already winning accolades as a true innovation in health care education. In a time, and in a city, in which everything is fast-paced and engaging young people can be difficult, this mobile application is a quick one-stop shop to obtain all of the information needed to help young adults make informed decisions on obtaining health coverage. The application can also help users identify facilities and providers that have been recommended by others in their communities. Since September 2012, YI has strived to improve the app, obtaining feedback from young adult roundtables around LA to ensure that the app is evolving in the most useful and targeted way for the population we serve. YI also continues to promote the mobile app through community events and asks users to provide feedback. However, to truly have an impact in terms of health and coverage for young adults in LA, YI must empower local young people themselves to take a lead role in our education and outreach program. Therefore, YI proposes to develop a base of diverse Young Promoters, ages 18 to 34, that can lead this effort and bring an authentic, trusted voice to their own communities. The Young Promoters will be given training on the ACA, coverage options, and on the use of the mobile app. Promoters will be selected among those that have participated in YI’s ongoing roundtable discussions and have been the most active in providing feedback. The work of these Promoters will result in the following: 1.\tOutreach and Education in Los Angeles: Young Promoters will be able to easily attend local community/school events and provide information about the mobile application and the importance of getting covered. 2.\tTrain-the-Trainer: After receiving the training, Young Promoters will be given the opportunity to develop their own project in which they will be given a goal to reach 1,000 young adults and educate them about the ACA, how they can enroll, and encourage them to download the app. Young Promoters will receive a stipend of $1,000 when they complete their 6 month individual projects. We anticipate having 20 Young Promoters in year one. 3.\tMobile Application Social Media Campaign: Through the base of Young Promoters and the young adults they train and inform, these Promoters will lead a social media campaign in which they will support the use of the free mobile application and will encourage others to continue providing feedback, information on resources that can be included, and most importantly to raise their voice on health care issues in their community. The goal is to ensure that a greater number of young adults are 1) obtaining health coverage and services and 2) that they are voicing their health care needs. Young leaders are the drivers that our communities need to ensure that everyone gets the care they deserve. As many organizations and groups in California are preparing to begin informing and enrolling the community in Covered California, YI and its Young Promoters can be the informational and educational providers and the voice for this population.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Young Invincibles has had notable successes in its health coverage and access program, establishing itself as the national leader on promoting health care and coverage for young adults. In 2011 and 2012, YI led a coalition of over 50 national and local partners around our “Getting Covered” health care education campaign that provided information to millions of young adults on and off-line about how to get covered up to age 26 under the new law. As part of this campaign, YI released and distributed online a health care education toolkit to educate young people on the importance of health coverage, timed around Valentine’s Day, with a reach of over 1.5 million young adults. Already, over 3.1 million uninsured young adults have taken advantage of the dependent coverage provision and gained affordable insurance, far exceeding expectations. In fact, young adults are the only demographic to see uninsurance rates decline during the Recession.",

We have talked to a wide variety of health care clinics that serve young people and are excited about our mobile app in particular. We have worked with campuses extensively on the ACA, giving educational presentations to students at USC, UCLA, and CSULA; our networks extend to other campuses as well, where we engage in education trainings around financial aid and student loans; those networks will be brought into our health care outreach as well.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In 2050, success in health care would include coverage for everyone that is truly affordable along the entire spectrum of health care. The uninsured rate for 18-34 year olds in the United States is 27%. In California that rate is even higher at 31%. On the local level in Los Angeles, the data is even worse. With 39% of young Angelinos currently lacking insurance, something has to be done.",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Young adults (18-34) continue to go uninsured and without access to basic health care at rates that far exceed the rest of the population. The ACA presents an opportunity to make huge gains for young adults. In CA, there are 3.1 million uninsured young adults, representing 32.8% of all young Californians. Of that 3.1 million, 2.7 million earn under 400% of the federal poverty level and therefore would qualify for either subsidies in the exchange or Medi-Cal. Young adults comprise 42% of the total uninsured population in CA."

    "summary": "Food IS the common thread that can help solve the world’s major problems simultaneously. Urban farming points us in the right direction and aquaponics is the vehicle to get us there. Aquaponics is the most sustainable (economically and environmentally) way to grow food on the planet – most water efficient, highest yields, zero waste, better-than-organic, with incredible taste. It is a closed-loop system that combines aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (growing food in water). We developed a highly efficient model that grows more food per square foot than just about anything, using vertical grow- towers. The rendering posted above can produce up to 1000 plants per year in just 20 square feet in optimal conditions. Aquaponics grows leafy greens, herbs and fruiting crops along with edible or ornamental fish. After several years of operating different types of aquaponic systems we have found this approach to be the easiest and most efficient way to learn, teach and jump right into the excitement of growing your own food. OUR PLAN: We are prepared to install 25 of our unique aquaponic systems in 25 schools in 2013. Each school will receive training based on our existing course and manual (Art & Science of Aquaponics) coupled with maintenance and support. We will also encourage installation of the vertical grow-tower system to become a class project. Additionally, we have also budgeted to pay a stipend to 4 teachers to help us convert our course into a curriculum that meets CA State Standards. Integrated Environmental Education (including urban farming) has been proven by our partner Environmental Charter High School to lead to the highest graduation rates (and acceptance to 4-year colleges) in the US. Aquaponics is the future of farming on planet Earth. By combining the two, aquaponics + education, what better way to cultivate a resilient community?",

By then, LA will be operating enough farms in the city to provide the fruits and vegetables we eat. The ability to grow food will be a requirement to graduate high school. Cafeterias will harvest and prepare fresh food daily. Diseases like obesity and heart disease will be nearly eradicated. Fast food chains will have been replaced by salad and juice bars. Restaurants and institutional kitchens will source the majority of their food from town. Selling fruits on corner stands will no longer be stigmatized and illegal, but integrated into the policy of the city. Food justice and environmental justice issues will be taught in our history classes. And everyday will be an opportunity to celebrate easy access to the healthiest best tasting foods possible. All of this is not only possible, but also inevitable.",

Counting the numbers of teachers who have integrated aquaponics into their existing course work will be a bonus. Listening to the student “aquaponics ambassadors” give educational tours to their peers and community members will be a leap in education. Looking beyond 2013, the project will have maximized success when the school district begins to open up more land on campuses not just for educational-scaled systems, but also for aquaponic farms to be installed, sized accordingly, to feed the campus and the neighboring community… offering a clear path towards a hyper-local food system.",

This report card will be based on the collaborative efforts of the many agencies and organizations that are tracking specific measures but are perhaps not able to see the big picture from their individual scales. Called “The Pulse of Los Angeles,” the project will measure environmental indicators within a geographic context over time and compare where we are to where we need to go. The web portal will use maps to display the status and trends of environmental health, social equity, and economic sustainability in the region, based on already-existing and newly-developed measures. We will focus on tracking environmental quality measures, but will also uncover important connections between the eight realms: Education, Income & Employment, Housing, Health, Environmental Quality, Public Safety, Social Connectedness, and Arts & Cultural Vitality. We need to show, for example, how education impacts environmental quality and how safety is strengthened by arts and culture; in this way we can see the big picture of Los Angeles. By working together, we will demonstrate how collective impacts can make life better for all Angelenos. Working with multiple project partners and continuing on the work we’ve already started, the Council will demonstrate that “if you don’t measure it, you can’t change it!” By understanding how the region is performing and how all the work is interrelated, the paths forward will reveal themselves. As a result, Los Angeles in 2050 will be one of the most sought-after places to live, learn, do business, and retire. We are on that path, with so many strong and purposeful organizations, agencies, and individuals pushing us forward. And yet we are in danger of not achieving this LA 2050 vision if we do not work together to deliberately monitor, track, and report important indicators of the future vision.

You can find native fish (tasty ones, too) in the rivers because the channels have been re-engineered to remove barriers for fish swimming upstream. Trees overhang the water, cooling it off and providing organic inputs for stream health. Formerly endangered birds and amphibians are common.",

The truth is that if we don’t figure out how to live with the environment and within our water constraints, Los Angeles will fail as a major city. In thinking about how to catalyze the necessary changes, the Council for Watershed Health looks to its organizational “Vision 2025.” We envision a future for LA with clean water, reliable local water supplies, ample parks and open spaces, revitalized rivers, and vibrant communities. Looking at our own experience and examples throughout the region, we believe the creation of a report card is the most effective way to describe the progress towards this vision for all Angelenos to make them believe it is possible, and then update them regularly on how things were going.",

Initially, the f2 will take place downtown LA at LA Center Studios www.lacenterstudios.com and will feature a futures film festival, an arts and emerging technologies showcase and a music concert for a challenge/cause. The buildings at the LA Center Studios will become canvases for unique digital projection mapping creations and the Vortex Dome www.vorteximmersion.com located at the studio will house a fulldome festival showcase as well. The first of its kind in Los Angeles. The festival will also include the STATE OF THE ARTS symposium featuring thought leaders and experts addressing the latest trends in the arts and entertainment industries and will provide ideas and case studies around how the arts, creativity, entertainment and storytelling can be used to create a better world/future.

Together with the Millennium Project, we have present an annual STATE OF THE ARTS event since 2010. In 2011 we co-presented the STATE OF THE ARTS with the PGA: Producers Guild of America and also hosted a think tank to address how arts and media professionals could help to address 15 global challenges through their work. The event was held in The Vortex Dome, a 50 foot immersive dome theater and was streamed globally. During the think tank several ideas were generated including an idea to create an educational program called MYTHIC CHALLENGES that would help to inspire youth to create modern day myths addressing the 15 Global Challenges and create films about their stories. In 2012 the first class was launched and students from Grove Cleaveland High School Media Lab in Reseda collaborated with High School students in Afghanistan through the internet to create Mythic Challenges projects. Fantastic! Seven films were created by these students. To view these films visit the c3 site page and scroll down to the bottom of the page: http://consciouscreativity.com/millennium-project/mythic-challenges Not only did the students learn about mythic challenges storytelling and filmmaking they also learned about what a professional futurist is and does. In 2012 we were also awarded a $50,000 grant to produce an immersive ballet in the dome with a renowned 83 year old ballet dancer/choreographer. The piece, BLUE APPLE, was successfully premiered in September 2012 in the Vortex Dome to a very appreciative audience.",

    "organization": "Boys & Girls Club of Mar Vista Gardens",
    "summary": "Mar Vista Gardens is the third largest public housing site in the city of Los Angeles and is located in the 5th most crime-ridden neighborhood. The average household income at Mar Vista Gardens is $1,713 per month, more than half of households live at poverty level, and 67% of adult residents do not have a high school diploma. Currently, 600 school age youth live in this community. Our idea is to provide an after-school mentoring program that ensures that all the children in the Mar Vista Gardens community have the opportunity to build successful and productive futures for themselves and their families. The BE GREAT: Graduate program is the Boys & Girls Club’s solution to the low educational attainment rates and cycle of poverty in low-income communities like Mar Vista Gardens. BE GREAT is an evidence-based dropout intervention program that targets young people who are most vulnerable to dropping out of school. The program is based on the University of Minnesota’s Check & Connect model, which is one of 27 dropout intervention programs reviewed by the U.S. Department of Education thus far. It is proven to have positive effects for keeping youth in school. The Boys & Girls Club of Mar Vista Gardens will implement the BE GREAT: Graduate model to support and encourage academic achievement for young residents, ages 6 to 18 years. The BE GREAT program has three components: 1)\tMentor-Youth Relationships – Club staff and community volunteers build long-term mentoring relationships with youth by creating an environment of trust and open communication. The goal is to instill in young people the belief that “they can, they want to, and they belong.” 2)\tIntentional Tracking – Club staff watch for warning signs of student withdrawal from school (i.e. attendance, behavior and course failure). As mentors, they work with program participants to develop timely intervention that focuses on reducing negative factors, increasing strengths, problem solving and persistence. 3)\tEnhanced Club-School-Home Partnership and Communication – The Club and local schools work together to share information. The Club proactively reaches out to parents in order to engage them in their children’s education. Research conducted by Boys & Girls Clubs of America suggests that youth who attend program approximately once per week are more likely to demonstrate positive outcomes than those who attend less frequently. In order to ensure that our BE GREAT program is the most effective, we need to incorporate it into a comprehensive youth development program that provides a safe environment and fun, engaging activities. Support from the Goldhirsh Foundation and the LA2050 Challenge would allow us to create an interactive space where youth feel comfortable learning, playing, and building trusting relationships. Resources for an effective BE GREAT program include professional and committed youth development staff, a strong community volunteer program, academic enrichment activities in language arts and STEM subjects, and engaging space for learning, playing and socializing. The Boys & Girls Club of Mar Vista Gardens is still in the process of building and creating the necessary resources to realize our goal of operating a successful BE GREAT: Graduate program. Since we opened on January 28, 2013, more than 250 of the 600 school-age youth who live in the community have registered as Club members. Because membership is also open to youth from the surrounding neighborhood, we have the potential to serve hundreds more young people. The BE GREAT program would provide mentoring for all registered Club members, ensuring that they receive consistent support from caring and trusted adults. Moreover, it fulfills a critical need by addressing social and emotional problems that homework help and tutoring alone do not solve.",

The community at Mar Vista Gardens, which is 84% Hispanic and has 55% of households living at the federal poverty level, is highly representative of this achievement gap. Through this project, we would be able to establish the BE GREAT program at Mar Vista Gardens as a model for other low-income and public housing communities. In fact, the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) plans to use our after-school program, which is built around BE GREAT, as the model for youth programs at all of its housing sites. As a result, the program has the potential to impact nearly 7,000 young HACLA residents, and this number is continuing to grow as HACLA develops more low-income housing sites.",

The BE GREAT: Graduate program depends upon a high level of dedication and investment from community stakeholders, and it will help us forge more partnerships and strengthen existing ones. By 2050, we expect to see the BE GREAT mentoring program model at all Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles community sites, actively working to close the achievement gap among minority and low-income students. We also hope that schools throughout the city will adopt a similar mentoring model for after school programming if they are not already partnered with a local Boys & Girls Club. We want to transform the way Los Angeles educates our young people by introducing a holistic mentoring approach that supports their social and emotional development in order to foster academic and future success.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The Boys & Girls Club of Mar Vista Gardens has only just recently opened on January 28th.

Other highlights from the past two months include the formation of our first sports league (Ultimate Lacrosse League), creation of a recycling program for the housing community operated by Club members, our first Family Night celebration in honor of our one month anniversary, a St. Patrick’s Day party for teen members, and upcoming Easter Celebration for the entire community. Our Club members have started creating animated cartoons and recording music in our tech room. We are extremely proud of our teen members who have started tutoring our younger members. Two of our teens also had the opportunity to go to the Keystone Conference for their demonstrated leadership and community service."

In 2011-12, KIPP LA’s weighted average Academic Performance Index (API) score was 892 (800 is the statewide goal), compared to 700 in the neighboring schools of South and East Los Angeles. KIPP LA Prep, in Boyle Heights, is the highest-performing middle school in Los Angeles Unified School District for the second year in a row with an API of 924. Similarly, KIPP Raíces Academy, in East LA, outperforms 98 percent of elementary schools in California with an API of 961. According to the national norm-referenced SAT-10 test, 96 percent of KIPP LA’s kindergarteners and 94 percent of our first graders scored at or above the national average in English language arts.

KTC is also working to formalize these partnerships with select local institutions of higher education to create supportive communities for our alumni. In the long term, we believe college partnerships will identify strategies that educational institutions can implement to help close the achievement gap for all students of color and first-generation college students.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The neighborhoods of South and East Los Angeles, where KIPP LA students and alumni live, face astonishingly high levels of illiteracy, drug abuse, gang violence, and juvenile crime. Schools are overcrowded and underperforming; virtually all traditional public middle and high schools are failing according to No Child Left Behind. Overall, fewer than 10 percent of students in these neighborhoods attend a four-year college or university after graduating high school and only 4 percent go on to obtain a degree.\n\nToday more than ever, students in underserved communities need an outstanding education to prepare them for success in life and to overcome the cycle of poverty. Research suggests that by 2018, 63 percent of jobs will require some higher education. By comparison, only 36 percent of jobs will be available to those with a high school degree or lower, leaving those without higher degrees access to even fewer jobs than they have today. Over the course of a lifetime, college graduates will earn on average $1.6 million more than those without a degree.\n\nUnfortunately, the youth of South and East Los Angeles are highly unlikely to graduate high school college-ready or go on to graduate college. According to The Education Trust West, only 22 percent of LAUSD students graduate with the requirements necessary to enroll in a University of California institution. This is the case for only 16 percent of Latino students. Research suggests that just over half of these students will matriculate to college and only 41 percent of them will graduate. Based on these figures, we estimate that only 4 percent of students in South and East Los Angeles actually obtain a college degree within six years.\n\nKIPP LA, on the other hand, is succeeding at helping students from underserved communities “climb the mountain” to and through college. With the unwavering support of KIPP LA’s KTC team, 96 percent of our alumni are attending 140 high-performing, college-prep high schools, and nearly 85 percent are currently attending over 80 colleges and universities across the country. We foresee that our alumni – as self-directed, purposeful college graduates – will also work to improve educational and economic opportunities across Los Angeles. This will mean stronger economic outcomes, such as lifetime earnings and employment rates, in the city’s currently most underserved areas. Thus, supporting KIPP LA is not only an investment in underserved students’ education and preparation for college; it is an investment in the future of our city and country.",

They are highly visible beacons that have proven successful in broadcasting awareness to drivers, pedestrians and other bikers and help improve the visibility and safety of bicyclists on city streets.",

    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We would like to partner with numerous bicycling advocacy groups working in L.A. on various aspects of bicycle transportation and urban planning, community advocacy, access and safety. We would also like to partner with L.A. City, L.A. County Department of Public Works, the L.A. County Bicycle Coalition, LADOT, CicLAvia and many of the other advocacy groups that are passionate about raising awareness about bicycling safety and improving access to safe biking on city and county streets.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "By 2050, a large network of monitoring devices and sensors would be installed throughout the L.A. region, both stationary counting devices and mobile sensing devices via bike-mounted sensors, mobile apps on cellphones and other open source counting, measuring and monitoring devices. This open data would be aggregated and made available to the public and to L.A. County to integrate into existing and future smart city traffic monitoring programs, allowing bicycle traffic to be included in city and county-wide realtime traffic monitoring programs.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "We have been involved in a number of projects focusing on urban mobility and the interface with cities and the built environment. Marc Alt was founding Executive Director of the Green Parking Council, a non-profit organization which is seeking to transform parking into a platform for innovation to support bike sharing, car sharing, electric car charging infrastructure, green building standards and re-inventing parking as a force for good in cities. Marc has also worked with some of the leading companies in the automotive, architecture and engineering fields on urban mobility projects, including the launch of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Increasing the visibility of bicyclists will improve the safety of biking in L.A. and will in turn lead to more people feeling comfortable choosing to commute via bicycle.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Using measuring devices from companies such as Eco Counter, actual metrics of increases in numbers of bicyclists on city roads will be captured and reported. Baseline and target metrics will be established in partnership with the city and county's master plans for bicycling."

    "summary": "At Communities In Schools of Los Angeles, our vision is 100% high school graduation. The current graduation rate for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is 64.2%, and among Latino and African American students it’s just 60% and 57% respectively. As the LA2050 report highlights, more than 20,000 Angelenos are entering our economy every year without a high school diploma.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "CIS of Los Angeles is a data driven organization, committed to the rigorous measurement and monitoring of outcomes. We track students' attendance, behavior and academic marks every five weeks, in addition to annual graduation, culmination and grade promotion rates. We have also begun to collect longitudinal progression data to track individual students within our feeder patterns, with the longer-term aim of evaluating the impact of our program on every student as they progress from 6th-12th grade.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "CIS establishes strategic partnerships with school leadership, community-based organizations, social services agencies, health care providers and parent and volunteer organizations to provide students with interventions that address their unmet needs.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "In 2012, Communities In Schools commissioned a national economic impact study to quantify its economic and social returns to society through a rigorous third-party investment analysis. Conducted by EMSI, one of the nation’s leading economic modeling firms, the study found that every dollar invested in Communities In Schools of Los Angeles generates $38.00 in economic benefit for the community. Students who earn a high school diploma have been shown to earn over $300,000 more over the course of their lifetime than peers who drop out. Businesses benefit by having a more skilled and productive workforce, taxpayers benefit through a broadening tax base, and the public generally benefits from reduced social costs attributed to dropping out of high school, such as crime and unemployment. Despite LAUSD’s 64.2% graduation rate, in 2012 96% of CIS of Los Angeles students graduated on-time from high school. The benefits to our community are much more than merely subjective. What does all of this mean? A $100,000 grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation through LA2050 would result in $3,800,000 in economic benefits to Los Angeles.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Since starting our program at Venice and Hamilton High Schools in 2007, school-wide graduation rates have risen 9.8% and 12.4% respectively, with leadership reporting a stronger college-going culture at both schools. This despite massive budget cuts resulting in the loss of personnel at both schools, including teachers, college counselors, Title 1 Coordinators, Pupil Services & Attendance (PSA) counselors and school psychologists.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success in 2050 would be a 100% graduation rate for students in LAUSD, achieved through the modification of the fundamental way in which resources are delivered to schools and families in Los Angeles. Every student would have access to coordinated, accountable, personalized assistance through a Site Coordinator, whose first responsibility would be to know the name of every student who might be at risk of dropping out. Community resources would be brought inside the system to provide a safety net of wraparound services for students and families."

    "organization": "The City Project",
    "summary": "Los Angeles County is home to over 1,000 City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments, over 100 California Historical Landmarks, and 20 National Historic Landmarks. Some, like the Coliseum, are prominent fixtures in the area. Others are hidden, such as the first Jewish site in LA tucked away on a hill by Dodger Stadium, or St. Vincent’s Place, the first institution of higher education in Southern California in what is now an alley between Broadway and Hill. Our idea is to create an interactive online guide and user-friendly smartphone app that highlight city, state, and national cultural and historic landmarks in LA County by mapping them with linked photos and content about each site’s history and cultural relevance. This service would increase exposure to the full spectrum of LA’s landmarks and paint a more complex, multicultural portrait of LA. Previously, we mapped over 940 City of Los Angeles monuments, with interesting findings (www.mapsportal.org/thecityproject/monuments). The official government listings contain limited information about the number, name, location, and date of designation of a monument. Through our research and mapping, we linked city monuments to map locations and added photos and brief content about the history and cultural relevance of the site. In so doing, we discovered that only ten percent of the city monuments were related to people of color, women, or Native Americans. This stands at odds with the diversity brought on by migration and immigration that was pivotal in LA’s creation, and it reflects the glaring inequities in our city. State-designated landmarks more closely approach an accurate reflection of LA’s demographics, with nearly 40 percent of the landmarks honoring people of color, women, or Native Americans. We will update and expand upon our online mapping of city monuments to include city monuments designated since our prior work and all state and federal historic landmarks. We will create a smartphone app that provides photos, locations, and content about each site’s history and cultural relevance to facilitate on-the-go access to and appreciation of all of LA’s landmarks. Mapping LA’s cultural and historic landmarks will reinvigorate forgotten cultural aspects of the county’s history. Local residents will gain a deeper understanding of their neighborhoods, and visitors will be able to see LA beyond its famous tourist attractions. In so doing, we hope to draw attention to the past and present demographics of the city and celebrate the history and diversity of LA.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "After we launch the app, we will measure success by the number of downloads. We hope the number of downloads will correspond with increased familiarity with all of LA’s cultural and historic landmarks. We also can include a check-in feature in the app to gauge if people are visiting the landmarks.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The diverse and vibrant art, music, dance, fashion, cinematography, and photography in LA that continuously push the envelope would continue to thrive in 2050. Along with this forward momentum, however, success in 2050 would also include preservation of LA’s past in a manner that is alive, engaging, and dynamic. By the year 2050, the number of cultural and historic landmarks in LA will have surpassed the number registered now. And an app might be as archaic and obsolete as floppy disks are now. Nonetheless, we hope that in 2050 the spirit of our project will be manifested in an inclusive, multicultural Los Angeles that celebrates its past.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles has never been a monolithic city or county. The cultural and historic landmarks in LA chronicle the major developments in the city’s formation, in which people of diverse ethnicities played a crucial role. By increasing awareness of these landmarks, our project will enhance understanding and fill the knowledge gaps in LA’s history.",

The areas that Never Built highlights – such as mass transit, park space, river restoration, the city skyline, civic buildings – will have become well-planned rather than mere afterthoughts. For example, the city would have efficient, effective mass transit, with stations that are magnificently designed. A nondescription locale like the Cornfields, just north of downtown, would have been long ago made over into a thriving parkland accessible to all of the city’s residents. Stunning and effectively planned public buildings would be designed by a broad cross-section of the talented architects in the city, not just by large, well-connected firms.",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The stories surrounding these projects reveal a reluctant city whose institutions and infrastructure—from a fractured power base to risk-averse developers to reluctant neighbors —have often undermined visionary work. Our goal is to change this culture, shedding light on the city's many missed opportunities so that visionary, creative, innovative ideas in the large-scale pubic realm will once again be embraced here. Furthermore, much of Los Angeles is ugly and poorly planned. Another aim is to end the complacency about this fact. We want to connect the inherent appeal of unrealized designs to the daily experience of the built world. We want people in Los Angeles and elsewhere to regard beauty and livability as essential rights in their lives."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Los Angeles Review of Books",
    "summary": "We are trying to establish a major institution for cultural exchange and conversation, centered on an online review of arts and culture. Los Angeles-based and Los Angeles-focused, the Los Angeles Review of Books (LARB) is the communal product of many minds, including some of the best know and most established figures on the L.A. cultural scene, along with emerging L.A. writers in the fields of literature, art, music, politics, and cultural studies, enhanced and enlarged by the active conversation of readers all over the city, the county, the state, and beyond. We work hard to bring the worlds of publishing, academia, film and television, new media, art, and music together with the common reader in a fruitful, productive, and engaging conversation. --- In a feudal world, there is no criticism; only the king's taste matters. Given the cosmopolitan collection of diverse cultures here in Los Angeles, literature, the arts, and culture need a critical conversation, need to have spokespeople and champions and translators and critics to help cultural work find its audience, to build bridges among communities, and to disseminate the best that is being thought, written, and produced here in Los Angeles to the full range of local audiences and out into the larger world. --- Cultural criticism has a long and important history, and for the last 150 years it has taken place largely in a print world supported by advertising and subscription. That world is dying, as seen as the shuttering of book review supplements in almost every city in the country, and the shrinking of book and arts coverage elsewhere. LARB aims not just to replace these lost venues, which have been central to the vibrancy of American culture over the last century and more, but to rethink them, reinvent them using all of the new media tools at our disposal, making the cultural conversation more diverse, more interactive, and more wide-ranging, less hemmed in by traditional models. By merging the worlds of traditional literary publishing, academia, small presses, online writing, film and television, and the explosion of desktop production of all kinds, LARB hopes to build a big cultural tent, creating a space for very fragmented communities to interact and learn from each other. --- LARB is a daily online publication that has already, in a small way, begun this transformation. We are a largely volunteer organization that has managed to post over 1300 in-depth reviews, essays, and interviews, produced by a wide variety of contributors, from first-time writers to some of the most esteemed figures in literature, art, music, film, television, politics, and culture. We have already seen the impact on the morale of writers and readers in L.A., and we hope to increase our presence and impact, bringing our work to a larger audience, and a wider array of audiences, as described below. We also will impact the arts and culture scene through innovative public programming around the city, and through developing innovative curricula for our schools. --- In sharing culture and cultures, communities thrive. We are not interested in art for art's sake, or criticism for criticism's sake. We think that literature, art, and culture are central ways that a society understands itself, incubates its own progress, and forges its bonds across what might otherwise be divides. We hope to be a major partner in helping Los Angeles arts and culture continue to significantly enhance human development. --- We believe that all art and culture is both local and (at least potentially) global at the same time, and that a central way to ensure the continuing vitality of the L.A. arts and culture scene is to disseminate its work nationally and globally. We also believe that while the world has taken notice of L.A.'s excellence in classical music and art, as well as, of course film and television, it has been slower to recognize L.A.'s literary and critical strengths. We have started to have a real impact in that area and hope to do much more. Criticism and conversation are necessary to incubation, to nurturing, and to bringing literature, the arts, and culture to their largest possible audience, and thus to have their greatest impact, to realize their greatest potential.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "LARB will provide, for the people of Los Angeles, a source of lifetime learning, global in scope and yet local in its perspective and in many of its concerns. Our website will be a meeting place for everyone interested in culture in all its various guises, an open forum for anyone to participate in. --- Our presence in local media, as in our current collaboration with KCRW and our work with KCET in development, will help more people become engaged with the literary, artistic, and intellectual life of the city. Our public programming, like our current collaborations with The Broad Stage, LiveTalksLA, and LAPL’s ALOUD series, will continue to increase in breadth and frequency, bringing a series of newly conceived, multigenre performances to a variety of audiences, building on the work being done on our website. And, in turn, our national and global presence will help bring readers elsewhere an appreciation for L.A.’s contributions to culture; that is, we will post podcasts and video digests of these events on our website and our YouTube channel. Our public programming will enhance the offerings the city already has, and our partnerships with the arts and culture organizations listed below, along with, we hope, partnerships with many more, will help integrate our famously fragmented city. --- We bring the most recondite and specialized research from our major universities, art schools, and colleges and make it accessible to anyone in the city. --- By placing the writers in the worlds of film and television, the literary writers, the popular genre writers, the academic writers, and the newspaper and magazine writers, we build bridges among tribes that have long kept their distance from one another, with benefits in all directions. --- Our work with high schools will help engage students with culture in many different ways. --- We will be a new and vigorous and innovative partner with all of the arts and culture organizations in town in the project of bringing the world to Los Angeles and Los Angeles to the world. We will help recruit, train, and retain the writers and critics required to keep Los Angeles the most important city for arts and culture in the country.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "There are 5 central measurements we use to assess how we are doing. (1) We will measure our readership. Although our most engaged readers are in L.A., we now have readers in 150 countries and in all 50 states reading almost a half million pieces a month. We hope to double that each year for the next two years. Reaching those numbers would constitute success in this area. (2) We will measure the diversity of our contributors. We successfully attracted a wider range of writers & reviewers than any of the other most important reviews of books and culture; in the VIDA survey of women’s participation in book reviewing, for instance, our numbers are better, sometimes by a factor of two or three, than all the major outlets except the Women’s Review of Books. But we want to have much more robust representation of African American, Latino/a, Asian American, Persian, and other communities. We would measure our success by the rise in those numbers. (3) We will monitor our influence. Already we see publishers featuring our reviews on book covers and in advertisements, and see references to our pieces in NY Times, New Yorker, Slate, Salon, and many other newspapers, magazines, and websites. To see that increase would be a measure of our ability to impact the national cultural conversation, as would higher Google rankings of our pieces, and mentioned in other highly-ranked pieces. (4) We will gauge our success by the support we receive. Our success so far has been made possible by people’s willingness to support the project financially (as well as by their willingness to volunteer their time as editors, & by their willingness to donate their writing or write for a very nominal sum). Our success going forward can be measured by the willingness of people to financially support our project, making the other two less necessary. We have roughly doubled our contributions from our 1st year to our 2nd, & we would like to double again this year and next. We are starting a membership program, & the level of participation in the program will be an important measure of our success, as will the total dollars raised. (5) We will measure our success in terms of the support we can give to others. We believe strongly that writers should get paid for their work, & aim to help to reverse the damage done to writers’ livelihood by the decline of print periodicals. We will consider it a major success if we raise enough through gifts, grants, & auxiliary income to pay writers the rates that print book reviews have traditionally paid. We also would measure our success by whether we can expand our outreach in community programming & educational services. We hope to produce more in the way of radio programming, for instance, to bring our curriculum project to more schools, & to bring the intensive editing workshops we provide our interns to other high school, college students & recent graduates. If we are serving a broad range of L.A. communities we will consider ourselves a success.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Los Angeles would be a city with a more vibrant, a more inclusive, a more intelligently discussed and more widely, globally appreciated cultural scene. The different literary communities, from the graphic novel readers and writers, the electronic culture producers and consumers, to the TV, film, and new media writers and users, to the academic researchers in all fields of the humanities and sciences, across all races and ethnic groups, and across all of the arts, would have at their disposal a responsive, innovative, interactive forum, a \"publication\" that would bridge the academic and popular, the local and the global, and the traditional and the new. LARB will have kept on the cutting edge of any new technologies useful to its mission and its readers. LARB will have helped keep alive the fine arts of editing, proofreading, and fact-checking, and will continue training new generations in them. LARB will have developed multiple platforms for use in instruction from the early grades through graduate colleges. The best that is being thought and written and produced in 2050 would be finding its maximum audience. LARB will have established itself as among the very few leading forums for arts and culture in the world. And instead of losing ground, as predicted in the GOOD report, Los Angeles, through the vitality of its literature, arts, and culture, will have increased its ability to enhance human development, both in the city and county, and far beyond.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We collaborate, first and foremost, with the 100s of contributors and our 100s of contributing editors, the majority of whom are L.A.-based. We are collaborating with our readers, whose comments are an increasingly important part of the site. We collaborate with a number of local arts and culture institutions, including the L.A. Public Library, KCRW, KCET, Broad Stage, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, USC, CalArts, UCHRI, Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities, LiveTalksLA, and PEN USA. We collaborate with publications, universities, and literary groups around the country, co-sponsoring events, doing cross-promotion on our sites and in social media. We have also started to work with LAUSD, a pilot program at Animo Pat Brown Charter H.S.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "We have already partially succeeded in bringing a sense of community to the cultural life of L.A. in a new way. We are training a new generation in the lost art of editing. We have built something the literary, artistic, & intellectual community is proud to be associated with, & proud to have represent them. We have received extravagant praise from the larger literary community. The New Yorker called us “an instant jewel of the internet,” Pico Iyer said we are “like 1000 angels descending,” Salman Rushdie claims ours was the best piece of criticism written about his work, & writers Jon Robin Baitz & Michael Tolkin call LARB “the best literary magazine in the country.” But more importantly the best writers in the country want to write for us, & continue to come to us not only from all over L.A. County, but also from New York, Boston, the Midwest, the West, & overseas. We have achieved the status of a major voice in the cultural conversation in a remarkably short time. We have been recognized by the publishing industry in Publisher’s Weekly, the business community in Forbes, & the academic community in Chronicle of Higher Education, & many other venues. The accolades are based on our daily achievements in bringing forth smart, dynamic, beautifully written, carefully curated, edited, & fact-checked essays, reviews and interviews and the conversations that develop about them on the website. Primarily, in other words, our site is our achievement, an ever-growing, intelligently interlinked conversation on literature, art, music, film, TV, politics, new media, & the rest of our shared culture. We have succeeded in bringing together writers from around the world, bringing together new writers with top professionals, writers from a wide variety of different cultural worlds: literary fiction, SF, fantasy, mystery, thriller & other genres; the commercial publishing world & the nonprofit & academic worlds; the big presses and the small and the self-published; artists, architects, sociologists, medical researchers, musicians, filmmakers, scientists, & TV writers; & all of these from across a broad array of the immigrant communities that define L.A. We cover a much wider range of texts, genres, media, & topics than the traditional periodicals in this field, reflective of the less hierarchical, less tradition-bound culture of Los Angeles. While the other arts have enjoyed national prominence, literature & criticism have lagged. We feel we have succeeded in making people (including the New York publishing world) understand the importance, diversity, and vibrancy of the literary culture of this, the largest book market in the world, & in making the perspective of L.A. writers we provide part of the necessary reading for publishing professionals around the world. Our pieces are reprinted by Salon, Daily Beast, & publications in Brazil, Germany & elsewhere. And we have managed to begin working toward sustainability, increasing our income significantly."

    "organization": "The Learning Garden",
    "summary": "The Learning Garden wants to build a garden at every school, church, empty lot, public library, traffic median and every home in Los Angeles. Over the ten years as one of the most vibrant school and community gardens in Los Angeles, The Learning Garden has learned that a garden is not just a place that grows wonderful organic fresh food which brings people to good health. It is not just a place that grows medicinal herbs which not only cure illness but teach health care practitioners how and why each plant creates health in people. It is not just a place where school children are exposed to nature, the knowledge of how to grow their own food, and learn about careers in nutrition, horticulture, science, art and ecology. It is not just a place where people learn to grow their own cotton and flax, dye plants and the traditional art techniques to create both utile and artistic materials. It is not just a place to save seeds from heirloom foods that are becoming extinct, helping to save our biodiversity. It is not just a place that beautifies a neighborhood, adds oxygen to our air and reduces waste. A garden is also a place that brings people together and even more profound – connects them to the earth. It’s a place to celebrate each other – to share both knowledge and food --- a place of “common ground” for young and old, rich and poor, men and women – a place that enriches the quality of life on every level. While we chose the Indicator of Environmental quality, this project also impacts education, arts and cultural vitality, health, and social connectedness. The mission of The Learning Garden is to bring back that connectedness to nature, and teach people the importance of plants in our lives. By creating an outdoor learning center in an underutilized area of Venice High School, The Learning Garden offers hands-on education in horticulture, permaculture, herbology, botany, nutrition, art, photography, and environmental science to students and community. It not only beautifies the community, but offers a place of peace and serenity in an often turbulent “concreted” world. In the ten years of existence, The Learning Garden has been instrumental in starting gardens in many other LAUSD schools by offering teacher training, workshops, starter plants, mulch and wood chips and volunteers. Seeing amazing results, not only in the creation of gardens, but in the creation of supportive communities within our city, we now want more gardens in our city. Gardens, Gardens Everywhere is a project to make that happen. With the funding we would receive from Good, we will facilitate the installation of a minimum of 10 gardens in interested communities throughout the city. We will train project leaders to assist communities to build what THEY need in their community, offering classes, supplies, seeds, mulch, plants and helping them find their community volunteers and local businesses. We will ask that groups fill out a questionnaire, commit to the project and to training and get a minimum of 20 people involved. We will offer free monthly classes to inspire the participants what needs to be done each month. We will supply tools for big work days and give each group funds for tools of their own. We will supply mulch, compost, seedlings, seeds, trees, and workday food and water. We will offer lifetime memberships to the Seed Library of Los Angeles so they will have access to non-GMO open pollinated seeds for their gardens. A project manager, together with the board of The Learning Garden, will design the application process, and criteria on which projects are chosen. The project manager will also design the protocols of the lending tool library and all forms, and be responsible for the inventory. A “propagation crew” will be hired to start seeds, transplant, propagate cuttings, graft trees, to create a huge resource of plant materials for the new gardens. Any participant will be able to “intern” with the propagation crew to learn how to do this for their own garden. A monthly class will be offered for all participants, and will be taught what to do in the garden that month, with hands on learning, and opportunity to have their specific questions answered by a highly respected horticulturist. Each project will have its own project leader who will guide them in the design, implementation and sustainability of the garden. We will also work with Good Karma Gardens, a pay-it-forward operation that starts gardens in individual’s homes, whether in their yard, on their patio or roof. The recipient of their labor would be expected to help install someone else’s garden in the near future. Again, all individuals will be offered free monthly classes, and membership to the Seed Library of Los Angeles. Good Karma Gardens will have access to the Lending Tool Library, seed, mulch, chips and plants, and a working fund for water and refreshments for work days.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The first measure of success would be the physical completion of 10 garden projects throughout the city. Each project leader will document the process and participants will be asked to write about their experience in the process. A blog page on The Learning Garden website will be created for each garden to document ongoing progress. The true measure of success will be the yearly reports and stories of the effect the garden has on its community, and the programs and other gardens it inspires.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Imagine a Los Angeles of the future with gardens on every block, in every school, church, office building, roof top -- everywhere! Gardens which are rich in food and beauty bringing nature back into everyone’s lives-- how could this not be good? Communities will be brought together with the common goal of growing food, herbs and flowers that will benefit their own neighborhoods. Eating local will be as local as it can be which benefits our ecology in so many ways: reducing traffic, oil consumption, the carbon foot print and adding oxygen into the air. People will be healthier from eating fresh organic produce and working the land in their spare time. Our retired and elderly will have purpose, as well as a community that supports them. People in need will have access to fresh food and herbs. Our children will learn through the garden – science, art, nutrition, ecology, respect for nature and community, -- naturally and profoundly. And the most important thing that we have found – people will connect to each other and resilient communities will evolve. Resilience is the quality that will see us through all that may face us in 2050, whether due to climate change, peak oil results, earthquakes and fires, economic collapse, or anything that will challenge us as a people. At The Learning Garden, we have seen remarkable changes in ten years. We can only imagine what the next 37 could manifest if we start now.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The most important achievement of The Learning Garden is the continual growth of programs and gardens it has inspired over the past ten years. With very little funding, The Learning Garden has demonstrated the true meaning of sustainability through community spirit and volunteerism. Over 250 high school students a year are trained in organic horticulture, and many have pursued careers in horticulture related fields. In our Seed to Sale program, students learn the process from planting to harvesting to selling at the local Farmers Market. Our art students regularly use the garden to draw and paint. The science classes are out in the compost piles learning the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The building of neighborhood gardens in the vastness of Los Angeles will help the city in many ways. We have learned over the last ten years that a garden that is shared by community and students builds a strong support system. It beautifies the city, creating green lush food and flower gardens, adding trees and community gathering areas. Growing and eating locally helps the ecology, reduces the carbon footprint, reduces excess trash, and creates healthier individuals. Most importantly, it creates community; a garden has no limits as to age, race, gender, creed, culture or color, or economic status. A garden brings together people at an equal level to work together and develop trust and support. It reconnects people to each other, making our city rich in positive relationships working toward the good of the community, not just the individual. It will bring educational opportunities to schools , churches and neighborhoods. Each garden will exemplify the culture of the community around it and the network of gardens will share knowledge across the city to each other.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The Learning Garden partners with many organizations and will promote this project through all its venues. For this project, we will work with SLOLA, Transition Towns, Tree People and Good Karma Gardens. The Seed Library of Los Angeles will supply seeds for the seedlings as well as seeds for the gardens directly. Good Karma Gardens will supervise the installation of individual gardens. We will work with the Transition groups to offer reskilling and repurposing workshops, Little Free Library builds, cooking and canning classes, and other interests. We will contact Tree People for large tree donations and Better for help with water catchment designs. We will create contacts with local businesses in each area for additional support."

    "slug": "2013/college-track-creating-a-pathway-to-college-in-boyle-heights",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "College Track",
    "summary": "In this country, there exists a persistent gap between the academic achievements of low income, predominantly African American and Latino students and their high income, white peers. In California, less than 16% of students of color graduate from high school with the required classes to attend a University of California or California State University campus. On a nation wide scale, only 22% of low-income students earn a bachelors degree within 6 years of high school. Students are not getting the support necessary to navigate the college landscape to college completion. We aim to provide this support. College Track is a national educational non-profit organization working to increase high school graduation, college enrollment, and college graduation rates among low-income students. Our ultimate goal is to transform communities—like Boyle Heights, where our Los Angeles center is located—into places where all students have the opportunity to graduate from a 4-year university. We do this by opening College Track centers—centrally located in communities demonstrating significant need—where our students receive academic and college readiness support in a learning ‘hub’ environment. Through this work we narrow the achievement gap and build college-going cultures in the neighborhoods where our centers are located. Currently, the organization supports more than 1,400 students at centers in East Palo Alto, Oakland, San Francisco, New Orleans, Aurora, Colorado, and now Los Angeles. College Track strongly believes that if you give motivated students the resources and tools to succeed, they will. College Track was founded by volunteer counselors who discovered that many students were motivated enough, but lacked resources to access college. College Track helps students with their academics, coaches them through the required tests, prepares them for the culture of higher education, supports them through the application process, and mentors them throughout college. These are kids who have the will to succeed, but lack the support to be successful. We provide them with that support, so that they in turn can reach their goals. The student who is accepted into the College Track program receives academic and mentoring support for up to ten years, starting in their freshman year of high school through their college graduation. There is no other program like this in the country. College Track students currently attend more than 75 four-year institutions including Harvard, Stanford, MIT, University of California (Berkeley, Los Angeles, Riverside, Santa Cruz), Howard University, Spelman College, and Columbia. Programming consists of: Our Academic Summer Advancement Program prepares rising 9th graders for the challenges of high school. Academic Affairs provides comprehensive academic planning, tutoring, monitoring and support. Student Life provides students with opportunities to explore their passions and engage in their communities. College Affairs guides students in all aspects of college admissions and support with scholarships. College Success supports students once they are in college, through advising, financial assistance, and social engagement. Over the course of four years, students receive support equivalent to one extra year of high school. At the suggestion of Mayor Villaraigosa and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Deasy, and given the scarcity of educational support in the neighborhood, College Track began an expansion of its services to Boyle Heights in East Los Angeles this school year. The students here deeply need and deserve a safe space with caring and nurturing adults who help them with their high school academics, prepare them for the culture of higher education, support them through the college and scholarship applications, and mentor them all through their college years. College Track is partnering with two of the small schools affiliated with Roosevelt Senior High School in Boyle Heights – The Academy of Medical and Health Sciences, and the Math Science & Technology Magnet Academy. College Track is co-located on the Roosevelt campus for our inaugural year and has plans to expand off site as our program grows. Our first class is comprised of 30 freshmen from each of these Academies, for a total of 60 students. We will continue to grow the center by adding an additional cohort of 60 freshmen a year. By 2015-16, our Boyle Heights center will be fully enrolled with four cohorts of students, totaling roughly 240. College Track strongly believes that neighborhoods and schools must work more effectively together to support the healthy development of youth. College Track and its partners have the opportunity to radically improve the academic and life outcomes for students in Boyle Heights.",
    "goal": null,
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "College Track's program and services are linked to a proven model of college preparation and completion. Today, our national strategy stems from sixteen years of outstanding program results: 100% percent of our seniors graduate high school, compared to an average of 50% in the districts we serve, 90% are admitted to a four-year college, compared to roughly 15% of students of the same demographic, 80% of students who complete our high school program have graduated from, or are still attending college. Over time, College Track increases the number of college-bound students of color in each community we serve. College Track students are often the first in their families to attend college, and with this example, their families, neighborhoods, schools, and peers adopt a mindset that a college degree is the expectation, not the exception.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "“We need to see more College Tracks. Ideally I’d want to live in a world where we wouldn’t need College Track, where every student would be going to college. But we do need College Track, and just one center was not enough,” David Cruz, Class of 2004.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Only one-third of Boyle Heights residents 25 years-old or older have a high school diploma, and only 5% of these residents have a college degree. Additionally, close to 50% of students from Boyle Heights never complete high school. On a host of academic measures, schools in Boyle Heights have historically been very low performing. In 2010, 41% of Roosevelt High School students graduated high school in four years, and only 22% of those graduates were eligible to attend a four-year university. At Hollenbeck Middle School, only 6% of 8th grade students scored proficient or advanced in math and 19% in English language arts (ELA). At Roosevelt High School, only 5% of students are proficient or advanced in math and 26% in ELA. We intend to change all of this.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "College Track is partnering with two of the small schools affiliated with Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights -- The Academy of Medical & Health Sciences, and the Math Science & Technology Magnet Academy. Our first class is comprised of 30 students from each of these Academies. Boyle Heights native Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas is supporting College Track philanthropically, and by launching the Peapod Music & Arts Academy, which provides instruction in performing arts. Other partners inclide Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the California Endowment, and collaborations with several CBOs including the Boyle Heights Learning Collaborative, Homeboy Industries, and Proyecto Pastoral, creating a strong community base to support out work.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "College Track’s primary measure of impact is graduation rates. We track students’ college status and progress through college graduation and compare results to national and regional averages for similar demographics of students. College Track has the following primary goals for impact: 1) 75% program retention; 2) 100% of our students graduate high school; 3) 90% matriculate into four-year college programs; 4) 75% graduate from college in six or more years."

    "organization": "Los Angeles Communities Advocating for Unity, Social Justice and Action, Inc.",
    "summary": "Today’s youth will bring tomorrow’s environmental change. Los Angeles Communities Advocating for Unity, Social Justice and Action, Inc (LA CAUSA) believes that our youth possess the power to bring systemic change to their environments. Our youth go from the Streets2Gardens. The Streets2Gardens program will be a stepping stone to establishing a community’s ability to become self-sustainable by growing its own food, as well as addressing the issue of the quality of air, through the engagement of disenfranchised youth at elementary schools. The goals of the Streets2Gardens program are two-fold: (1) create a curriculum that is engaging to youth and small children in order to encourage participation in growing gardens and trees to improve the environment of impoverished areas; and (2) get different communities in LA County to support green initiatives to improve their environment though planting gardens and trees. When there is a curriculum that is engaging and relevant to the community, the possibilities are endless. LA CAUSA's youth will create an engaging curriculum for elementary school children in schools the most affected by environmental neglect. LA CAUSA’s youth will also conduct research and determine which elementary schools they wish to approach. The goal is to select two elementary schools in cities, such as Huntington Park, Highland Park, Rosemead and even as far as Pomona. These schools will be in addition to two elementary schools which LA CAUSA has already been working with in Los Angeles: Humphreys Avenue Elementary and Eastman Avenue Elementary School. Once they have selected the schools, then the real fun begins. Alongside the elementary school children, our youth will plant gardens with an array of native Southern California plants, including fruits, vegetables and trees. As part of the program, our youth, with the assistance of experienced staff, will also educate the elementary school children and the surrounding community about the environmental benefits of growing their own food and planting trees. They will treat the soil, plant the seeds and trees, harvest the crop, and educate the elementary school children on how they can do the same at home and help the environment, as well as have healthier food options. The youth will also give workshops to the community about the importance of youth getting involved in environmental issues and share their work at the elementary school gardens. There is power in numbers. There would be about 10 youth involved in this program, broken up into two teams of five and assigned to one of the existing gardens and one of the new gardens. In addition, our youth will host a minimum of two community workshops, bringing different sections of the County together. LA CAUSA’s youth will use their creativity to produce marketing materials, such as brochures and a video of their work, to promote the program and the positive impact of youth involved in environmental issues. The written materials will inform the community of the work being done, why it is being done and who is performing the work, with special thanks to the funder that made it all possible. The video will track the curriculum created and show how any school and family can take their limited resources to grow a garden that can produce healthy food options, as well as address environmental concerns about air quality. Through the Streets2Gardens program, LA CAUSA’s youth will learn necessary life skills that will be transferrable to post-secondary education and employment opportunities. They will be taught to be accountable to their peers and the community by being timely, perform, and work as a team. Therefore, they will receive compensation in the form of stipends to model after a real-life employment situation. If they do not meet the requirements of the program, then their pay will suffer. These necessary life skills will give our youth the ability to establish positive habits that will enhance their level of success in post-secondary education and employment. In educating the elementary school children and the community about the program, our youth will incorporate how life responsibilities affect the outcome of your efforts. For instance, if the garden keepers lack responsibility and fail to timely care for plants and trees, the environment suffers. LA CAUSA believes that through these gardens, some of the most impoverished areas of Los Angeles can become self-sustainable and be better equipped to control their environment. Through the involvement of the program's youth, LA CAUSA seeks to show that when you give youth a sense of purpose, they can be catalysts for change no matter where they come from or what their past looks like. The youth will give back to the community and engage in environmental activism to improve the same area that is currently being destroyed by poverty and environmental neglect.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "LA CAUSA has successfully begun to grow gardens at Humphreys Elementary and Eastman Elementary. These gardens have served to host mentor/mentee events and has engaged a number of community youth and elementary school children. Through the California Endowment, LA CAUSA has also helped corner stores in Boyle Heights change their appearance and products to offer healthier foods, including more fruits and vegetables. The corner stores receiving this attention are those surrounding poor-performing elementary schools in Boyle Heights. Recently, San Gabriel Conservation Core and LA CAUSA have been discussing a partnership to grow a community farm that would feed families in need of healthier food options.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "As part of the curriculum, pre and post assessments can be given to the elementary school children, as well as the community members who attend the workshops. These assessments will reflect how much they knew about the benefits of gardens on the environment before working with LA CAUSA and compare it to the knowledge base after attending an educational session or workshop with LA CAUSA. It will also measure the likelihood of those engaged in the program to remain involved in the future. We will create a database to track the age of the participants, knowledge before the program and after, and their likelihood to remain involved in some way with improving their environment. The goal is to have at least 80% of the participants give the program a successful rating.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "LA CAUSA has been fortunate to have a great ally in San Gabriel Valley Conservation Corp., which has express a interest in creating a partnership to address environmental issues, in particular, the need for the community to become self-sustainable through the cultivation of gardens and farms. In addition, Humphreys Elementary, Eastman Elementary are current partners in LA CAUSA's efforts and we look forward to contacting two additional elementary schools to expand the work LA CAUSA has begun. LA CAUSA will also actively continue looking for opportunities to create partnerships and collaboration with other organizations to further LA CAUSA's garden ideas.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Streets2Gardens program will benefit Los Angeles by bridging the gap between different communities on the issue of environmental neglect. The Streets2Gardens program will create and promote a garden curriculum that can be replicated in any school and individual home. The program will also show how youth have a tremendous amount of power in changing the circumstances of their communities. By putting soil, seeds and trees in the hands of our youth, and connecting them with their community in a positive way, they will become catalysts for systemic change in their environments. Streets2Gardens will begin by getting 10 youth off the streets and into gardens, creating and teaching a garden curriculum that will be engaging and powerful. Streets2Gardens will get result in different sections of Los Angeles County coming together to discuss how their environment affects them and how the gardens will begin to address a number of health and environmental issues.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "LA CAUSA envisions Los Angeles to be full of gardens at all schools and homes. The schools and homes would provide healthy food options to the community, thus realizing true self-sustainability. It follows that the air quality would have improved given the increased presence of plants and trees in the communities. Los Angeles would look green with rich reds, oranges, and yellows, to name a few colors, with crisp wind blowing."

    "organization": "Foster Care Counts",
    "summary": "I would use $100,000 to shape the future of Los Angeles by applying this money to the development and implementation of the Foster Care Counts Virtual Mentor Program that is currently being conceived by Foster Care Counts, a 501c3 corporation whose mission is to improve the lives of foster youth in Los Angeles County. Although I believe that a mentor can help a foster or at-risk youth with any if not all of the challenge areas proposed in LA2050, I propose that Foster Care Counts’ Virtual Mentoring Program will create positive change in the area of education, as educational achievement continues to be one of the major impediments foster youth face in our country today. Although 70% of our nation’s foster youth desire to go to college, only 3% of them are able to graduate with a degree. After fully developing a best-practices virtual mentor program, I propose to use this funding to pilot a mentoring program to assist current and former foster youth to both enter as well as remain in the following postsecondary educational institutions in Los Angeles: UCLA, Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles Trade Tech Community College, and Cal State Los Angeles. Background There are currently more than 400,000 foster youth in our country today, and approximately 20,000 of them reside in Los Angeles. This is by far the highest number of foster youth living in any city in the United States. Having been removed from the homes of their biological parents due to abuse and neglect, either through the criminal justice system or LA County Social Services, these children become wards of the state. As decisions and resources available to raise them are now dictated by taxpayer votes and dollars, we, as taxpayers, have now become the parents of these children who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves homeless, voiceless, and powerless. Foster children are much more likely to experience the consequences of not only abuse and neglect than the general population, but face serious impediments to the ability to grow and mature to live stable, adaptive lives in rates that are astonishingly higher than their non-foster peers. Upon becoming legal adults, usually at the age of 18, foster youth are no longer protected by the foster care system, and face disproportionate rates of homelessness, unemployment, inadequate education, poverty, and physical and mental health problems when compared with their non-foster peers. For example, according to Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, The United States Department of Health and Human Services, Casey Family Programs, and the Hilton Foundation, in 2011 approximately 22% of former foster youth were experiencing homelessness compared with .04% of the general population, 52% of former foster youth were unemployed compared to 9% of the population at large, 33% were living below the poverty level compared with 15% of the greater population, 57% of former foster youth have had at least one mental health diagnosis compared with 26% of the general population, and somewhere between 25-35% of former foster youth have been incarcerated compared with 2.7% of the general population. (Barbell & Freundlich, 2001; Culhane, Metraux, Byrne, Moreno, & Toros, November 2011; Marian, Lovie, Kirk, & Peter, 2009; Munson & McMillen, 2009; P. J. Pecora et al.; P. J. J. P. S. R. L. H. L. J. O. A. Pecora, 2009; Trout, Hagaman, Casey, Reid, & Epstein; Zima et al., 2000) Moreover, the average number of placements in different foster homes for these youth is 7, and many foster youth experience as many as 12 separate foster placements before they reach age 18. 65% of former foster youth experienced seven or more school changes before 12th grade, less than 60% of foster youth graduate high school, and although 70% of foster youth would like to and/or plan to attend college, approximately only 3% graduate college, as compared to the national average of about 30%. Of the foster youth who do enter college, almost a full 100% are unprepared academically and do not possess the independent living skills necessary to matriculate successfully through college without the support network of a family. There is a tremendous amount of peer-reviewed literature analyzing both the barriers to as well as protective factors that enable foster youth to succeed in their ability to grow up, become educated, and lead constructive lives as adults. In fact, foster youth probably suffer from significant lags in most if not all of the challenge areas included in LA2050, and could benefit from assistance directed toward each one of these arenas. I believe that a mentor would have the flexibility to be able to assist foster youth in many if not most of these challenges, and that if the foster youth population could be significantly assisted, we might see other at-risk populations become included into this model, with the ability to positively impact the statistics in each of the LA2050 challenge areas.",

Guardian Scholars is an on-campus support organization to support foster youth in college. I plan to partner with two state licensed clinical psychologists who have prior experience with foster youth, one of whom has done a great deal of consulting for Los Angeles County. I plan to collaborate outcome research with the University of Southern California, with whom I am collaborating on other outcome research related to the foster care system.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Of the 70 % of foster youth who wish to attend and complete college, I would consider my program successful if a statistically significantly greater number of youth were able to finish college with the help of a virtual mentor than are able to do so today, if the model of virtual mentoring were extended beyond the foster care system to all at-risk populations, and if there were government incentives available to those willing to be virtual mentors because the benefit to society far outweighed the taxpayer cost of the incentive.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Interviewing Skills Workshops for Foster Teens",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "I can perform evidenced-based outcome studies to either show that virtual mentoring provides a statistically significant benefit to foster youth and their ability to complete college, or that the program does not provide the anticipated benefits and future funding should be directed on other types of programming. If outcome studies show statistically significant benefits, these studies can prove to be very valuable in attempting to direct government funding and legislative change by showing how vastly the benefits would outweigh the costs.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Virtual mentors can help foster youth enter and complete college, and as indicated in the LA2050 challenge, better education can increase prospects and participation in community life in all areas of the LA2050 challenge, creating better citizens and a better city. A myriad of resources exist to support my assumptions about the potential benefits of providing mentors to youth who lack the support and guidance of a stable family. M.R. Munson et al. found that “older youth exiting foster care value having someone that maintains contact, stays by their side, and is simply there for them” (Munson & McMillen, 2009). Samuels and Pryce found that young adults more often seek instrumental forms of support, such as help with housing, but that their pride may hinder them from asking for emotional support (Griffin et al., 2011; Samuels, 2008). Data from this study revealed that both of these forms of support were perceived by the foster youth as valuable. Leadbeater & Way’s study on young adults reported that they often want another person in their lives that will hold them accountable and set limits (Leadbeater & Way, 2001). Finally, the National Mentoring Partnership (2004) found that an online mentoring program taking place between 2002-2004 “bolstered mentees' self-esteem, literacy and future orientation.”"

    "organization": "Public Matters",
    "summary": "Public Matters is not after the quick fix. We’re in it for the long run. We believe a great idea will become an effective solution only if the community it seeks to help takes ownership of it. Market Makeovers: NextGen Leaders proposes to evolve young leaders from within their communities to drive long-term sustainable change in the places they live. Specifically, we are asking LA 2050 to fund a group of emerging adult community leaders (age 18-24) to transform the food landscape, food behaviors and health outcomes in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights, building on an existing infrastructure within which they’ve worked for the past three years. These NextGen Leaders are deeply committed to the work of improving the health outcomes of their community, having already invested some serious sweat equity, received extensive training in health, leadership, public speaking and media production, and transformed local stores. For them, it’s personal; the work they do impacts the health of their families, friends and loved ones. LA 2050 funds would take their leadership development to the next level so that they have increased opportunities and greater capacity to bring about meaningful, sustainable community transformation. Public Matters has been greening food deserts through Market Makeovers since 2007 – one corner store at a time. We started in South L.A. with the Healthy Eating Active Communities Initiative and for the past three years, have been doing Market Makeovers in East L.A. and Boyle Heights through Proyecto MercadoFRESCO, a project of UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities. In recent years, there have been numerous “corner store conversions” (as they’re known in public health circles) to address the “grocery gap” in “food deserts,” areas that have limited access to quality, healthy food; an overabundance of fast food; and high rates of chronic conditions related to poor diet. Typical corner store conversions involve some physical transformation of existing stores, the addition of healthier inventory (usually fresh fruits and vegetables), and some marketing of the new items. Shortly thereafter, the stores are left to their own devices. As an intervention strategy, Market Makeovers are another order of magnitude, aiming for community transformation. They encompass education; community engagement and relationship building; business training for storeowners/operators; store transformation; and social marketing to change health behaviors and increase fresh fruit and vegetable consumption. Local youth and residents play a central role in the hands-on work of transforming markets, educating the community about the benefits of fruits and vegetables, and promoting the Market Makeover stores. They implement the solution, and in so doing take ownership of it. Market Makeovers are not just about supply; they’re also about creating demand. You have to make sure you have community buy-in, that if you stock those fruits and vegetables, locals will buy (and eat) them, so that healthy food retail becomes viable. That’s where the NextGen Leaders come in; LA 2050 funds would enable them to pick up where conventional corner store conversions leave off, after the fanfare of the grand re-opening dies down: to promote transformed MercadoFRESCO stores in East L.A. and Boyle Heights so that healthy food retail takes root, becomes the norm, and results in improved health outcomes. LA 2050 funds will provide NextGen Leaders with additional training and opportunities for leadership development so that they can work directly with Public Matters, Nathan Cheng Consulting, municipal and community partners to shape the project. NextGen Leaders will receive training in store operations, marketing, graphic design and visual literacy so they can assist the stores with retail presentation and merchandising, create in-store graphics and displays and social marketing campaigns to promote healthy food behaviors. They will plan, promote and conduct community events: public presentations in schools and local organizations, cooking demos at the markets, and video screenings. They will access local leaders and participate in community meetings and decision-making processes. They will become the public faces of the project and lead East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights to a healthier 2050.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "By 2050, the NextGen Leaders will have started a healthy chain reaction that ripples far beyond the health indicator. Within the health indicator though, the term “food desert” will be thing of the past. The words, deeds and creative social marketing and community engagement tactics of the NextGen Leaders will have inspired many a healthy eater. Quality fruits and vegetables will be commonplace in corner stores and in larger markets. Competition amongst stores, widespread social marketing campaigns about healthy behaviors, and pressure from both residents and local government, in addition to additional Market Makeover projects, will contribute to this change. Communities will be judged by plethora of healthy items and healthy community activities that exist in an area, rather than by the paucity of them. As a result, there will be significantly lower rates of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Communities served by the NextGen Leaders will have spread throughout Los Angeles, leading to a broader awareness of proper dietary habits and, just as importantly, access to healthy products.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Health indicators and behaviors will be evaluated by Public Matters, and independently by UCLA-USC CPHHD and Nathan Cheng Consulting. NextGen Leaders make daily visits to and reports about the Market Makeovers stores to Nathan Cheng. Among the items that they observe and report are: the condition of produce, temperature of produce cases, store appearance inside and outside, and promotions of monthly produce specials and other in-store campaigns promoting healthy behaviors. Beyond reporting, these visits are vital to cultivating a healthy relationship with all stores and establish NextGen Leaders are invested helpers to the stores. Nathan is also responsible for the overall relationships with the stores and for business training, including tracking inventory and sales of healthy and non-healthy items. We also use targeted promotional activities like frequent buyer cards for produce, coupons and store flyers that are easily tracked. CPHHD tracks the quantity, quality and level of nutrition education of the cooking demos.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "East L.A. and Boyle Heights, like many under-resourced neighborhoods, have had their fair share of solutions presented to them by experts, usually from outside their communities. Some of them get implemented. Of those, few are implemented long enough and with adequate resources to take root, to become part of the fabric of the community it serves such that members of that community claim it as their own. The issues around the East LA + Boyle Heights food landscape and poor health outcomes among its predominantly Latino residents are serious and unhealthy food behaviors deeply entrenched. According to the L.A. County Department of Public Health, its population suffers high rates of obesity-related chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke. It has some of the highest rates of childhood obesity (32.2%) in the county. The situation will not change overnight. Because NextGen Leaders are from the community, their fellow community members are more likely to listen to what they have to say. Their actions on behalf of their neighborhoods carry greater weight. They can lead from within, in a way outsiders can’t. Support for Market Makeovers: NextGen Leaders is a long-term investment in the future health of East L.A. and Boyle Heights, a model of home-grown leadership development that could be applied all over Los Angeles.",

    "organization": "Art Share Los Angeles",
    "summary": "With your support, Art Share L.A. will rebuild its organizational plan and restructure its culture to adopt a model conducive to creative placemaking, serving as a case study in the advancements of mixed-use creative live/work centers throughout Los Angeles. As defined by the National Endowment for The Arts, creative placemaking is “when partners from the public, private, non-profit and community sectors strategically shape the physical and social character of a neighborhood, town, city or region around cultural activities. Creative placemaking animates public and private spaces, rejuvenates structures and streetscapes, improves local business viability and public safety, and brings diverse people together to celebrate, inspire, and be inspired.” This process detailed in the NEA’s report on creative placemaking occurred organically and un-institutionalized in the eastern outskirts of downtown Los Angeles during the mid-80’s. Sandwiched between Skid Row, Little Tokyo and the Los Angeles River, artists and creative individuals set up shop and home in vacated warehouses. As the economic and cultural impact of creativity on the neighborhood began to show, more formalized arts organization and institutions began to develop—Art Share L.A. among them. The industrial warehouse area outside Downtown was renamed the Arts District and the neighborhood experienced a major demographic shift: more creative individuals began to inhabit the area, creating a flourishing neighborhood of art, music, culture, and true autonomy. In a typical pattern of gentrification, the migration of wealth and infrastructure development attracted to the area began displacing the creative individuals that had worked to make the community inhabitable, and the informal centers that housed the creative placemakers began to disappear. Property and land developers set their sites on reclaiming the neighborhood, and in a period of 10 years, property values sky-rocketed from an estimated $.25/sq. ft. to over $2/sq. ft. for newly modeled “artists lofts”, in reality simply luxury apartments with creative branding affixed. The need for buildings like Art Share L.A. in the downtown area is high, as is the risk that they will suffer the same fate of many informal art and cultural centers in the area. Our goal is to create a new model of community living, fitting the creative placemaking definition; through education and community engagement we will work to create new live/work centers throughout Los Angeles County. Our first step in this process is rebranding and re-establishing the organizational structure at Art Share L.A. to create a sustainable and equitable community-run model. The second is to produce a public resource document to those seeking to create similar live/work artist run centers. This project will impact Arts and Cultural Vitality by creating immediate opportunities for meaningful engagement in the arts—leading to long-term sustainability. During the 7-month project, Art Share L.A. will create: •\t6-10 part-time entry-level and supplemental employment opportunities •\tA Work-Exchange Program for presenters without access to capital •\tA formalized Program Board for communal review and assessment of proposed classes, events and partnerships •\tA team of consultants to work with the staff, Program Board and Board of Directors to assist with coherency in areas of the marketing, development and assessment processes necessary for sustaining the model Projected long-term benefits of the project will include a sustainable, accessible live-work/multi-use facility, as defined by the governing principles of creative placemaking, capable of housing and supporting artists in their professional development, now and in the future. Additionally, sustained activity works to enhance the overall quality and livability of neighborhoods surrounding downtown Los Angeles, most specifically, the Arts District.

Pershing Square is a City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks outdoor concert and event center which serves the community as a recreation center. With the addition of a playground at Pershing Square the community can continue to meet the growing needs of its youngest residents. Playgrounds provide crucial and vital opportunities for children to play. There is substantial research showing the clear link between play and brain development, motor-skills, and social capabilities. All learning—emotional, social, motor and cognitive—is accelerated, facilitated, and fueled by the pleasure of play. Playgrounds that promote different types of play are vital for a child’s cognitive, emotional, physical, and social development. Playgrounds provide a safe environment designed specifically to foster and enhance the opportunities for a child to play alone, with a caregiver, or with other children. Given the importance of play in the development of a child, any space which gives a child free reign to do just that should be seen a crucial component in a child’s life and in the continued growth and development of one’s community.

In the next decades as the city expanded, and its population center relocated, Pershing Square worked to establish a representation of its growth, and supported the incorporation of structural modifications designed to attract visitors to our growing city. After several reincarnations executed by creative work by the Department, and with strong support from the business community, it was resolved to reestablish the original dream to make Pershing Square once again the jewel of the downtown core, and offer the best of space to local residents, venue visitors, and tourists.",

So whether kids are playing on the playground swings at recess, or having friends over to swing on their own swing sets, it's more than playtime; it's a time to grow. A playground is a wonderful place for children to release stress. Swinging, jumping, climbing and running are good for children both physically and emotionally. Taking time away from structured activity is an important part of keeping a child well-rounded and healthy. A playground is not just a playground. It's a place for kids to dream, relax and learn to work with others. By nurturing our children in this way, we help create a healthier community."

    "summary": "The Front Line Leaders Academy (FLLA) is a program of People For the American Way Foundation, a nonpartisan educational organization founded in 1981 to promote and defend the American values of liberty and equality for all, and to ensure that the promises enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are made real for all members of our pluralistic society. As part of PFAW Foundation’s youth leadership programs, FLLA is an advanced leadership training program that bridges the gap between Young People For, our program for training campus leaders and the Young Elected Officials Network, our nonpartisan network of progressive young electeds. FLLA specifically addresses the growing demand to engage, equip, and empower young progressives (18-35) with the skills and strategies to move into positions of local leadership and to support them as they prepare for involvement in local campaigns within their communities. We propose, in response to the My LA2050 challenge, to implement a Los Angeles-based Front Line Leaders Academy for 20 young, emerging leaders from low income, LGBTQ and communities of color in Los Angeles County. For six months these fellows will participate in trainings on a wide range of leadership development and political skills, including how to be an effective candidate, campaign management, finance, communications, and field organizing. The 20 young leaders will be recruited by Young People For in May for the LA-based Front Line Leaders Academy. Then, from June through December 2013, these FLLA fellows will participate in a series of workshops led by campaign experts, along with members of the Young Elected Officials Network. Motivated by their strong will for public service, fellows will work with these young elected officials and campaign experts during four three-day convenings, conference calls, online trainings, and in one-on-one sessions aimed at monitoring the progress of each fellow. By graduation, FLLA fellows will have developed a wide range of campaign skills, and will have compiled a complete campaign book that will enable them to be effective local leaders. Through their participation in the LA-based Front Line Leaders Academy, these 20 youth will be educated on progressive issues, including civic engagement, and connected to each other, asked to participate civically, provided with role models who are civically engaged, and encouraged to network with others and discuss their experiences with others. Curriculum for the trainings will include public speaking, building personal narrative, base-building, message development, and management. In addition, we will identify LA-based campaign experts and community partners to offer sessions on best practices and lessons learned in local work on education, civic participation, the environment, and health, among others. The Front Line Leaders Academy was launched in 2006 by PFAW Foundation and trains 20 emerging leaders each year. The Academy is responsible for launching the careers of over 100 civic participants, many of whom have run for public office or served in some capacity on political campaigns or community organizing. These young leaders are providing a vital infusion of ideas, energy, and passion to the progressive community, and their commitment to continued activism and leadership is critical to building a progressive future for cities around the country, including Los Angeles. What most of these emerging leaders need is a catalyst to channel their own potential and support in sustaining their connection to the progressive movement.

    "organization": "TRUST South LA (Tenemos que Reclamar y Unidos Salvar la Tierra-South LA)",
    "summary": "TRUST South LA is building a model for sustainable living in LA in 2050, with a bold plan to make better use of the 3000 acres of underutilized land in South LA, which can be replicated throughout the City. We are working to create affordable homes for our local families, placing land under community control, and building green, healthy neighborhoods. As a grassroots community organization, TRUST South LA is committed to building a vibrant South Los Angeles. We believe that how we use land -- and who controls that land -- has deep implications for the future of our City, our nation, and our planet. TRUST South LA was born from our community’s long struggle against displacement of working-class families, as property values and rents have risen in the neighborhoods south of Downtown LA, near the University of Southern California (USC) and around the new Expo Line. We value community ownership, responsible development, transparency, and the development of grassroots leadership. Over 40% of South LA households earn under $25,000 per year. In fact, 80% of our residents earn below the City’s median income. Clearly, we need economic development to increase people’s income levels, but we also need creative strategies to increase the amount of affordable housing available to these families. The majority of households in South LA can afford between $450 and $750/month for housing costs. Rents in our neighborhoods currently range from $900/month for 1 bedroom units, to over $1,600/month for a 3- or 4-bedroom home. There is an enormous gap between what our families have to spend on housing, and the actual cost of that housing. The result of South LA’s severe affordable housing shortage is that many families are being driven out of our neighborhoods, or they are forced to double-up in existing homes, causing conditions of crowding that are emotionally stressful for adults and children alike. This situation has been exacerbated since the economic crisis has driven up foreclosure rates, and many of those properties are subsequently acquired by real estate speculators. Here is TRUST South LA’s plan to protect our community from the threats of rising housing costs, deteriorating housing conditions, increased housing speculation, and displacement: 1) Purchase foreclosed homes that are on 5,000+ square foot lots, in the same neighborhood, and place the land into TRUST South LA’s community land trust. 2) Add a second 2- or 3-bedroom, 1200 square foot home on to each lot, utilizing high-quality, well-designed manufactured housing – taking advantage of existing State laws and local regulations to build these ‘backyard homes’, and cutting land costs in half. 3) Transfer the homes into a limited equity housing cooperative, through which the tenants collectively own their homes, while the land continues to be held under the stewardship of our community land trust. 4) Make the entire neighborhood more livable by working with the residents, their neighbors and other partners to advance street improvements for bikes and pedestrians, and to add more green and open space. Funding from LA2050 will support a demonstration project for resident-controlled housing in South Los Angeles that will be affordable to low-income households. The award will enable TRUST South LA to purchase and to rehabilitate six existing single family homes, and to add a newly constructed units on the same parcel, yielding permanently affordable homes for 12 families – housing 60-72 people by the end of the one year pilot phase. However, most importantly, our goal is to create a model that can be replicated throughout South Los Angeles and other parts of the City, with a demonstration that will draw the attention and confidence of City and State policy makers and funders.",

We all recognize that it is time to rethink, replan, and rebuild Los Angeles to be more compact and less dependent on cars. However, one of the challenges to this vision of smart growth is the many thousands of acres of single-family neighborhoods scattered throughout the City, which do not have lots that can accommodate multi-family housing. TRUST South LA is developing an affordable housing prototype for more families to comfortably live in these types of low-density residential neighborhoods – starting in our own South LA backyards. Furthermore, our model for single family affordable housing will require minimal government subsidy, which is critical in a time of reduced resources, creating the potential for large scale replication even during these lean times. With funding from LA2050, this demonstration project will provide an effective advocacy tool, as TRUST South LA and others pursue the capital subsidies from public and private sources necessary to implement this cost-effective housing model.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Real Estate Development Partner – East LA Community Corporation: ELACC has developed 360 affordable housing units in East LA, organizes community residents to advocate for change, and provides homeownership counseling. TRUST South LA has initiated negotiation of an MOU with ELACC, anticipating that we will share a project manager who will be responsible for acquiring sites, and managing rehabilitation and new construction.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "TRUST South LA works to establish community control over economic resources. We acquire land to be held collectively, and in perpetuity, by low-income community residents. Thus the land will never be subject to speculative real estate activities, industrial practices that compromise health, or slum housing practices. Use of the land will instead be directed by – and forever controlled by – low-income community residents, to meet the needs of their families and neighbors.",

TRUST South LA’s strategy of collective ownership is the result of our community’s desire to control the decisions that will dictate the future of our neighborhoods. With community ownership of real estate assets, we can ensure long-term affordability of housing, and direct the use of that land in perpetuity."

    "summary": "Many exceptional thinkers have observed, “you need to picture your idea before you can achieve it.\" With 36 Hours in L.A. 2050, ForYourArt pairs artists and urban visionaries together to imagine stops along a 36-hour itinerary in L.A. circa 2050. Through a series of roving conferences and an exhibition, 36 Hours in L.A. 2050 culminates in a future-forecast map stimulating thinking and creating new possibilities for our collective future. International arts figures will be invited to participate, broadening the reach of this conversation and integrating their perspectives to reflect the international nature of our city. Additionally, building upon the conversation started by LA2050, 36 Hours in L.A. 2050 will utilize LA2050’s eight well-defined success indicators as a touch point in discussions leading up to and during the roving summits. According to the 2012 Otis Report on the Creative Economy of the Los Angeles Region, 1 out of 8 regional jobs is in the creative economy. Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where 1 out 3 regional jobs is in the creative economy and this sector moves from the 4th to 1st largest employment cluster including an even more flourishing artist sector. Likewise, the Goldhirsh Foundation’s LA2050 report that sites that L.A. ranks near the bottom of large U.S. cities for volunteerism. Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where everywhere is a creative context and we have at least double social connectedness from 21.5 to 43 percent -- deeply increasing our civic and social engagement. What would our Los Angeles look like and how would an Angeleno or someone visiting spend 36 hours in the city in 2050? 36 Hours in L.A. 2050 creates a cross-disciplinary and participatory platform for visioning LA2050’s arts and cultural indicator and what everyday life will look like in L.A. 2050. Specifically, utilizing an April 3, 1988 Los Angeles Times Magazine’s 25-year look ahead to 2013 article as a reference point, the project will future forecast art centric visions of L.A. 2050 through an exploration with artists, architects, creatives, thought leaders, institutions and more, answering these questions: In 2050: What kinds of new creative economy jobs exist? What ethical shifts will have taken place? What does an “artist” do? What new landmarks will we have?What new kinds of organizations will we have? What will arts organizations look like? How will Angelenos spend their time in a 24-hour day? How might arts organizations evolve as part of this growing ecosystem? How will arts and culture spur civic connections and engagement? What does L.A. as an arts and cultural capital look like? The future forecast information collection will be multifold and will include roving talks and presentations taking place at 3-4 venues across L.A. -- all over the course of 36 hours. Conversations will be documented and inform an exhibition at ForYourArt at 6020 Wilshire Blvd. Through an invitational and open call process, artists, architects and others will be invited to exhibit their artwork, their ideas or concepts for “36 hours in L.A. 2050”. The conversations and exhibition are followed by a publication, MAP: ForYourArt L.A. 2050. The overall activities and vision of 36 Hours in L.A. 2050 will be captured in this “future map” that looks 37 years ahead to 2050. The map will include an invitation to meet up at an L.A. landmark in 2050 on a certain day and a 36-hour 2050 itinerary. ForYourArt will also utilize its platforms and partners to stimulate conversations around the forecasting and to further engage participation.",

Along the way, we will also collect statistics on the number of participants that continue in training programs, amount of investment/financing raised, and technologies created/licensed. Success for us also means new partnerships among the educational institutions in the region and other city and county job creation efforts.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The FLoW program will create new cleantech companies in Los Angeles. This will mean high-quality, better paying jobs for the underserved communities in Los Angeles. It will also help provide a skilled workforce and idea pipeline for the already growing cleantech community in the region. By basing these companies here in Los Angeles, LA will become the test bed for the next generation of clean, energy efficient technologies, which will meet the region’s ambitious clean energy goals, and will improve environmental quality.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "FLoW was created in October of 2011, and the first mentorship program and competition took place in the spring of 2012. As a result of that first operational cycle, we were able to leverage limited government support from the DOE into a vehicle that has attracted widespread stakeholder support and partnerships of benefit to young entrepreneurs, the cleantech workforce and ultimately the economy.

In order to increase the employability and earning potential of our city, we need to help working college students succeed in class and raise graduation rates. STRIVERS.LA will give students tools to balance work and school hours that too often overlap, by involving employers in supporting their employees’ academic success. STRIVERS.LA is a web- and mobile-based platform that will improve outcomes on both educational and employment indicators, helping to build a stronger Los Angeles through an educated workforce. STRIVERS.LA is partnering with the Los Angeles City College Foundation (LACCF) to bring innovative technology to low-income working students in Los Angeles, creating a more robust economy and a better-employed population.The Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) serves more than 250,000 students annually, and Los Angeles City College (LACC) serves 18,000 of them. Many of these largely low-income students struggle to balance employment and school. Nationally, 74% of students worked during the academic year, and 15 % are working full-time. Juggling work and school schedules leads to skipped classes, missed sleep, and even no-show exams. Research shows that every extra hour a student works above 10 hours/week lowers GPA by a measurable amount. Sixty percent of community college students work more than 20 hours per week and 25% work more than 35 hours per week. In California, fewer than 28% of students who begin a two-year college program complete a degree within six years; for those studying part time, this percentage falls to less than 12%, in both cases significantly below the national average.

We’ll demonstrate success by increasing the percentage of low-income working students who successfully complete college; we’ll improve profitability for businesses by reducing personnel and retraining costs, encouraging increased hiring and local investment. Most importantly, we’ll have created deep relationships between our community college system and local employers, developing a collaborative understanding of how supporting student workers will result in an improved economic environment for the entire community. We'll create new norms for employers about how to interact with working students, and new expectations for students about how best to balance work and school. Success will mean lower income inequality, more families earning wages that support their needs, and a more flexible, better-educated workforce able to adapt to changing economic conditions.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The goals of STRIVERS.LA are to increase graduation rates, involve employers in their employees’ success, and help grow an educated, responsible workforce for the city of Los Angeles. This project will focus the new technology of STRIVERS.LA on students in Los Angeles, and by partnering with LACC we will engage some of the most ambitious, but also some of the lowest-income students in the LACCD. Serving residents of Los Angeles' Metro urban cluster, LACC's student population is among the most diverse in the nation. Of the College’s more than 18,000 students, 54% are immigrants to the United States and 50% are first-generation college students. Current LACC students are low-income, with 70% receiving a Board of Governors waiver for tuition and 53% receiving some form of financial aid. A number of students are even homeless and hungry. Through our partnership with LACCF, we will be able to engage directly with this population, helping to bolster the employment that most students use to support their educational goals and improving their likelihood of completing an associate’s degree or transferring to a four-year school. By increasing graduation rates and educational achievement, STRIVERS.LA will increase the number of students who go on to earn “family supportive wages,\" improving the overall economic health of Los Angeles."

    "organization": "Harmony Project",
    "summary": "Harmony Project is an award-winning 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that targets low-income at-risk youth in underserved areas of Los Angeles. Founded in 2001 by a doctor of public health, Harmony Project is built upon the latest social science research on arts education. With a strong focus on peer mentorship, family support, and college incentives, Harmony Project changes the course of disadvantaged children’s lives. A feature that distinguishes Harmony Project among local arts education programs is that we commit to children throughout their entire childhood, regardless of their changing schools and circumstances. Students benefit intellectually, emotionally, socially and even physically, and their involvement in our programs sets a foundation for greater well-being now and in the future. Beginning in 2001 with only 36 students, Harmony Project currently commits to 1500 students for their entire childhood – from elementary and middle school through high school and beyond – to ensure they receive the support and guidance needed to graduate high school and continue to college. The students we serve come from families who’s income is within 185% of the federal poverty level, which is the same income test as the federal school meal subside. By virtue of the neighborhoods and poverty in which they live, Harmony Project’s target population is at risk for juvenile involvement in gangs, drug and alcohol abuse, aggression, school drop-out, teenage pregnancy and parenting, depression, and suicide. Most of our programs are located within Los Angeles’ twelve Gang Reduction & Youth Development Zones designated by the Mayor’s Office, neighborhoods up to four square miles in area where documented rates of violent gang crime are 400% greater than elsewhere in the city. While dropout rates exceed 50% in the Los Angeles communities we serve, 95% of Harmony Project’s high school seniors have graduated in four years and virtually all have gone on to college or trade school. We look forward to a future Los Angeles that is rich in culture, music education programs and performing ensembles throughout all of its diverse neighborhoods. Harmony Project firmly believes that wealth should not be a pre-requisite to the accessibility of music education and the myriad of benefits that result from the study and practice of this. The study and practice of music provides a wide range of benefits in terms of cognitive and social development (e.g., improved academic performance, self-esteem, behavior) and at a physiological level, learning music rewires the brain and nervous system in ways that improve language learning, support math achievement and effective listening, and help students develop both patience and focus. Furthermore, music builds community that cuts across barriers of class and culture, bringing together and celebrating diversity, while also creating a wide-ranging network of like-minded and involved citizens. Specifically through our Peer Mentoring program, Harmony Project is shaping the future of Los Angeles by creating a conglomerate of educated, creative, and dedicated alumni who not only will become active members of society, but more importantly are learning to become advocates for themselves, their neighbors, and their communities. The seed of giving back is planted early on in Harmony Project participants. Whether you are a student mentee, a student mentor, or one of the professional teaching artists, this multi-generational system teaches the importance of working within a community and the importance of re-investing in where you have come from. It is not just the 100 mentors a year or the 200+ mentees that are influenced by the success of this program. The positive results are felt within the entire culture of Harmony Project, affecting each of the 1,500 students that go through the program yearly. As a result, an endless ripple effect is created through generations of Harmony Project participants, their families, and the surrounding community now and as they continue through life. Involvement in the intensive and demanding Peer Mentoring program helps to keep older students engaged in music throughout adolescence, giving them purpose and motivation to complete the Harmony Project program, graduate from high school, and continue onto college. Students must be enrolled in school, turn in report cards, and show musical and character progress in order to continue participation in Harmony Project programs. We find that when older students are selected and trained to take leadership roles, they eagerly rise to the occasion and in-turn inspire younger students to follow their example. Peer-to-peer mentoring develops leadership capacity and responsibility, teaching and mentoring skills among our older students as well as builds relationships that cut across barriers of class, age, and culture, creating a sense of inclusion and comradery.",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Harmony Project exists to serve low-income families, for whom the program is provided at no cost. Harmony Project founder, Dr. Margaret Martin, saw how music can shape intellectual development in underserved children and bring hope and greater well-being to families facing substantial challenges. With rare exception, we accept only those families whose income is below 185% of federal poverty level (this corresponds to the eligibility criteria for the Los Angeles Unified School District’s free/reduced lunch program). The neighborhoods we serve must have at least 50% of students eligible for the lunch program."

    "summary": "Los Angeles is one of the largest producers of media in the world in terms of television and films, and more recently, online/broadband media. The creation and consumption of this media is an integral aspect of growing up in Los Angeles. But with 45% of households in L.A. not earning enough to cover basic expenses, the chances that young people have to influence or participate in media is limited. Even with the explosion of new media formats and delivery platforms, marginalized L.A. youth, particularly young women, continue to be underrepresented both behind the camera and in front of it — creating a “digital divide.” For a city so advanced and connected through film/media technologies, it is still shocking how it is one of the more disconnected cities in terms of integrating neighborhoods, cultural/arts groups, and young people, and how so much of the media industry continues to lock out the female voice. GlobalGirl Media (GGM) develops the voice and media literacy of teenage girls in under-served communities in Los Angeles by teaching them to create and share digital journalism designed to ignite civic engagement and social change. Our model is unique in that it pairs girls in L.A. with girls in the developing world, creating a peer-to-peer international network of girls that communicate via new media, co-producing POV-style journalism content that informs, engages and challenges its audience to action. GGM currently has projects in South Africa, Morocco, Chicago and Los Angeles, where it is headquartered. While teenage girls are by far the most active demographic on social media, they are still more consumers rather than creators. Research has shown that girls’ relationships, self-esteem and school performance are oftentimes negatively impacted by the more time they spend online, (Girl Scout Research Institute, 2011). GGM believes young women need to be creating their own media rather than consuming it. We envision a worldwide movement where young women are learning to challenge, innovate and reshape their worlds through digital media. With the explosive growth of “edutech” and digital learning programs across the nation, GGM sees itself as a collaborative, innovative and leading partner in this movement, by promoting diverse, cross-cultural viewpoints from a demographic rarely heard from in this arena: the young female voice. Founded in 2010, GGM was inspired by other youth media and digital literacy projects in Los Angeles, where community-based journalism, storytelling and filmmaking workshops are reshaping young people’s lives (LA Freewaves, Urban Media Foundation, Intersections South LA, Boyle Heights Beat, Venice Arts, HOLA, Echo Park Film School, etc.) We are proposing a GLOBALGIRLS MEDIA HIVE NETWORK, working together with these like-minded organizations to amplify the civic voices, aspirations and digital networks of girls to realize a more connected, equitable and sustainable future for Los Angeles. We are seeking funding to develop this hive, to be hosted at the Robert F. Kennedy Digital Media Learning Lab, inviting girls from all our networked programs to participate in a weekly after-school digital media lab throughout the school year, with a 4-week intensive kick-off course in the summer of 2013. Our program will train an initial 60 teen-age girls in digital literacy, solutions-based journalism, HD video production, web 2.0 basics, cell phone filming/texting and on-air media training. The girls will work in production teams and select their own subject matter, which will focus on issues of particular relevance to their lives, such as violence against women; sexuality, reproductive rights, education and careers, food and obesity, bullying and cyber relationships, education, arts, sports, music and culture. Visiting lectures by leading women professionals in media are incorporated into the curriculum, and the training also includes field trips to local newspapers, radio and television stations, maker/hacker spaces, youtube studios, etc. Our impact is as global as the reach of the internet and cellphone technology. More than just giving girls the skills they need to create original media--we make sure it’s seen. Our interactive website is a place where girls can safely upload and watch their videos, post blogs, play games, add comments, and interact with young mediamakers throughout the world. After the summer training, The GLOBALGIRLS MEDIA HIVE will become a safe haven/hangout for girls all across Los Angeles who can drop in, create media, share stories and otherwise network with each other throughout the school year. Although there are a finite number of girls being trained each year (60) as GlobalGirl Reporters, the hive hangout will be open to any girl in Los Angeles. Literally a HIVE of activity, girls will be producing local news programs, films, games, phone apps and media content that improves the overall quality of young womens’ lives in Los Angeles.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "As of June 2012, GGM has implemented initiatives in seven cities in South Africa, Morocco, Chicago and L.A., training more than 120 young women, who have produced 150 video features using traditional camera and sound; 85 mobile journalism pieces on I-pod touch devices; and 200 blog reports that were distributed through trans-media platforms, predominantly online, but also including print, broadcast TV and cable, cell phones, radio and social media. We have built a significant social media following, with 5,000 visitors per month to our website, 4,800 Twitter followers and 3,500 Facebook members (across four regional groups).",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success will be thriving, connected, innovative and safe digital learning space for young women in Los Angeles. Most critical to our success, more girls from low-income communities in Los Angeles will be more likely to stay in school, stay connected and excited about learning, and have a more global view of the world.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "While many digital news training programs and sites produce great content, they stop short of really activating their audience, finding out how that content influences and shapes lives. We at GGM are especially interested in how our training and the girls’ stories impact themselves and their communities.",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Anyone who lives in Los Angeles is aware of the glaring disparities between wealth, education and access, and how these schisms play out in the media. Girls in our target communities are grappling with a 45% high school dropout rate, gang and drug violence, high rates of teen pregnancy, and the overall challenges of growing up with limited resources. It doesn't help when they are also bombarded with highly sensationalistic reporting and negative stereotypes in film, television and music videos, rather than providing positive images and role-models."

    "slug": "2013/building-a-community-of-leaders-one-middle-school-student-at-a-time",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Minds on Fire",
    "summary": "Minds on Fire is a new initiative that actively empowers middle school students who are most at risk for dropping out to succeed as learners and community leaders. Minds on Fire will improve middle school attendance, student engagement and achievement by empowering students to apply academic coursework to the real-world issues they care about. Students take ownership of their education by creating connections between their classroom lessons with student-led community projects. MOF will place trained ‘Mind Partners’- retired teachers and college grads - in each class to work with and support teachers. These Mind Partners will work with teachers and administrators to build frameworks for projects that fit the content and pacing of each teacher’s curriculum. They will work directly with students as they design and execute their project. Mind Partners fill a range of roles, from facilitating student-led discussions about the issues they care most about to identifying developmentally appropriate projects that utilize the skills of the particular academic unit; from engaging parents, community partners, businesses and/or government strategically to seeking project funding. The work of students and teachers will be amplified through a network of ‘real-life’ and virtual platforms, creating a growing community of engaged and knowledgeable Angelenos. Students and teachers will be able to exchange ideas and share experiences throughout the school year through an online platform. Teachers and school leaders will be able to connect with one another and other community leaders through quarterly ‘learn and link’ events. And the entire Minds on Fire community will celebrate their achievements at a year-end event that showcases student impact and academic achievement. Student voice is central to this approach. In a national survey, students who themselves had dropped out told us how they would improve schools (1). Among their comments, students asked for: - 81% - Opportunities for real-world learning (e.g. service-learning, internships) to make classroom more relevant - 81% - Better teachers who keep classes interesting - 75% - Smaller classes with more individual instruction These comments are borne out in the research findings and recommendations of education experts like Dr. Robert Balfanz of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins and Dr. William Daggett of the International Center for Leadership on Education. The Minds on Fire model incorporates these concepts through use of student-led, project-based learning with immediate goals and opportunity for success. The classroom-level support allows facilitates exciting learning in personalized, small-group work among students. Los Angeles is home to a disproportionate number of America’s Drop-out Factories – schools in which less than 60% of students who enter high school in 9th grade graduate on time. Minds on Fire will focus outreach to schools that feed into these Dropout Factories and where middle school students are most likely to be struggling. By targeting these ‘feeder’ middle schools, we can reduce the dropout rates in the schools hurt most by a loss of students. We can identify which students are most likely to dropout of school in high school based on their middle school performance (2). Dr. Balfanz coined the term ‘ABCs to describe these indicators – Attendance, Behavior and Course performance. His research is echoed in the findings of others, including the California Dropout Prevention Center. Minds on Fire will work with students who demonstrate risk for dropping out based on use of the ABCs – students who: - Attend school less than 80 percent of the time - Have repeated behavior problems and/or problems that are mild but sustained - Fail one or more courses, particularly in math or English. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in 2011 “As a target for school reform, the middle grades present the last, best opportunity for educators to reach all students—and not just those who persist and thrive in high school.” Minds on Fire deploys a classroom-level reform model to increase the likelihood of at risk-students leaving middle school prepared to succeed and graduate from high school. In the first year of operation we plan to serve 300 youth in up to six schools, helping that many of the most at-risk middle school students stay on the path to graduation. By Year 3 of operations we will be serving 1,500 students per year, a figure large enough to have a significant impact on the 9th grade dropout rate. In the 2010-11 school year, 3,000 9th graders dropped out of LAUSD schools. REFERENCES 1. The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts, Civic Enterprises in association with Peter D.

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Minds on Fire is in the start-up phase. However, the organization’s founder created and piloted a similar model in New York City public schools as part of Mayor Bloomberg’s inaugural NYC Civic Corps in 2009, an initiative launched in partnership with AmeriCorps VISTA to engage people across that city in volunteerism. The Minds on Fire model is shaped by the successes and learnings taken from that pilot, in combination with a deep understanding of the Los Angeles education landscape and challenges specific to our school system.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Minds on Fire will use a rigorous evaluation tool to identify and measure the impact of Minds on Fire on participating students. Key to our approach will be comparing data for participating students against non-participating students from the same school and schools with similar characteristics where Minds on Fire is not in place.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Over time, Minds on Fire will build a corps of young leaders with the skills, confidence and commitment to effectively address challenges in their communities. They will enter high school prepared to graduate on time, with aspirations for college, career and civic life.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "MOF is in the process of developing partnerships with schools and community agencies. The most critical partnerships will be with the individual teachers and school leaders in MOF schools. We will also work with the education management organizations that have oversight for likely MOF schools along with leaders of the LAUSD. Other partnerships will be based on the needs of the specific communities in which students are implementing their projects. We will develop new partnerships and collaborations with community agencies, businesses and local government as defined by project needs. MOF is also engaging with foundations to build a sustainable future for the organization.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "An education system that significantly enhances human development is one that provides all children with not only a path to college, but also with the knowledge, skills and experiences to build fulfilling lives, however the individual defines that term. And it is a system that inspires confidence in all families and teachers who are part of it, in which the zip code in which one lives has no bearing on the quality of education one has access to."

Since its inception, the partnership between Más and MLA has aimed to create sustainable communities comprised of innovative civic buildings, well-planned open spaces, and green infrastructure. In our combined efforts we employ a diverse method of research, planning, and design. All of our projects begin with a foundational immersive research phase, which uncovers new design considerations - leading to employable, innovative solutions.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "For this project, Mia Lehrer + Associates will be collaborating with Sqirl, and Coolhaus to create an extensive food network that will help supply the best produce and goods for Los Angeles. While we will be handling the design and build of the truck itself, these partners will ensure it stays well stocked.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "This project’s success will be evaluated on the number of customers reached and communities served. Farm on Wheels’ effectiveness is reliant on the trucks being stable food centers in the communities they serve. It is essential for neighborhood residents to be able to rely on Farm on Wheels as a steady source of affordable produce. So, aside from the typical economic measurements of financial sustainability, we will look at metrics such as number of farmer collaborators, high income vs. low income customers, and value above replacement of similarly priced food. By looking at these more informative statistics, we will be able to better serve the communities we engage with.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Farm on Wheels will benefit Los Angeles by creating new community hubs that provide Angelenos access to healthy, affordable food. Like farmers markets, each truck will serve as a place for people to have a more hands-on experience with food shopping.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success in 2050 is a healthy Los Angeles. On a statistical level this means lower rates of diabetes, childhood obesity, asthma, and poor cardiac health, but more tangibly, a healthy Los Angeles would offer all its residents an integrated health system that takes into account all factors that influence health. This vision for a holistic health system includes the expansion of health clinics that offer affordable care to prevent minor issues from becoming severe health problems and providing the resources to manage and remediate chronic conditions."

The success of our efforts will be reflected by the agencies we will inspire to adopt the ideology of this level of greenspace construction. And the benefits will be seen directly by the community members we work with. If encourage one park building agency to adopt the idea that bringing nature back to Los Angeles in the form of creating access to greenpace in low income communities does not have to cost millions and take years, then we have succeeded.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "From Lot to Spot (FLTS) is a 501c3 non-profit founded in 2007 as a direct result of the relationship between lack of accessible greenspace and the quality of life in low-income neighborhoods. FLTS’s unique approach involves grass-root, community engagement to ensure disadvantaged communities contribute their voice in developing healthy spaces in their neighborhoods. In the last five years, FLTS has worked on healthy living community engagement projects in the cities of Inglewood, Gardena, Lawndale, Hawthorne and Lynwood. 2012 was a landmark year for From Lot to Spot. FLTS constructed and opened the first ever community garden in the community of Lennox, CA. , opened the 118th/Doty Ave Pocket Park: the first community-designed pocket park in the City of Hawthorne.

Education received the lowest rating in the LA2050 assessment because our schools are failing most of the kids in our system. We do not provide personalized learning options designed to meet the students at their level and interests, nor do we tailor most content for the rich media world that we are creating here in our tech industry. In LAUSD today it is difficult for a student to watch a video or play a game, two essential activities that improve learning interactivity and engagement. We will start by working with the community to provide mobile, alternative access to learning resources outside of the classroom for the thousands currently disengaged from the formal learning system. We will be targeting foster youth, dropouts and those disenfranchised by traditional learning and we will partner with great organizations throughout the city that work hands-on with youth (DIY Girls, Machine Project, Big Art Labs, LA Makerspace are a few identified through the LA2050 events). We aim to create a path for personalized, lifelong learning for all people, connecting the lost and displaced with educational resources across all types of media, people, places and courses of study. MISSION: Be the bridge for lifelong education of foster youth and all people, connecting people ready to learn skills with the masters in our community. Map expertise and comprehend our hidden talent! We can create the virtual support group for these youth to help each other finish their education and move forward to pursue their potential. SOLUTION: Targeting youth age 16-21 for engagement with masters across fields Help with sharing their skills as they develop + connecting to mentors Chart a path to becoming the expert in a new skill and apply for the grants available to achieve goals We will be asking the masters of Los Angeles to share a quick learning path = how they got to be the master in their field and how they choose to share that path with the next generation of creative leaders. We are creating a dynamic interface and network mapping tool for this learning so that we can see how LA connects the dots, shares resources, where the hidden gems are and how to begin empowering LA's youth to work with our masters in a clear and coordinated way. This is more than a mentorship program. MASTERY will include: * Livestreaming hangout series to connect youth around the city * Opportunities to win tablets and learning resource access * Bridge support for grants, funding opportunities and open doors to continuing education for those who may be losing hope * A lifeline and network of care for our disenfranchised youth and their friends throughout the city * Vision for building the future of Los Angeles together by rapidly building skills across fields and sectors, preparing LA for 21st century careers now emerging INDICATOR OBJECTIVES FOR LA2050: * Help at least 1000 kids access financial aid support to follow their path * Map at least 1000 experts across Los Angeles skills, talents, mastery abilities * Meet local design challenges through collaboration and invention in community STRATEGY: Livestreaming broadcast series in Hangouts + YouTube using the EDDEFY tools Host live, interactive events produced in the Vortex Immersion Dome at LA Center Studios (home to Mad Men and a ton of famous film/television projects) that match experts and students and bridge gaps for grants, support and continuing education Use social media to engage with youth and invite participation to find local resources that may be missing on our maps MAP ALL LEARNING: Makerspaces, museums, masters, courses, schools and universities, training programs, places that inspire us and resources from games to books and apps that teach us quickly how to work together and achieve our personal goals. In practice, our events will work a bit like an online game show via Google Hangouts and YouTube, providing access for anyone who can get to YouTube via library or community center. Emancipated youth and those who are transitioning to adulthood will be invited to participate online and these events will build the audience for the live event to be hosted near the end of 2013.

School gardens benefit students and communities in a variety of ways. The most immediate impact for these children is that after our school garden build, students have instant access to green outdoor spaces. Areas that were formerly unused parking lots or asphalt slabs are now transformed into lush and inviting gardens. In addition to improved aesthetics, these outdoor spaces can, over time, impact the health and wellness of children and their surrounding community. Air quality will be improved, leading to a lower cancer risk from air toxicity, and an increased exposure to the natural world will lead to a higher level of environmental stewardship. With this new exposure and education, students will learn how to implement changes in their daily life that reduce waste, energy consumption, and pollution. The gardens also act as catalysts to show students just how versatile, delicious, and fun healthy food can be, developing positive attitudes toward healthy food and increasing consumption of those foods.

We have seen first-hand how access to edible gardens can improve test scores and community involvement.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "In less than two years as a designated non-profit organization, EnrichLA has built over 35 school gardens. These gardens range from 1 acre farms, to wildlands schoolyard habitats, to reading gardens, or small edible raised beds. Our school gardens are inexpensive. They are built on a shoe-string budget using the power of community volunteers to fuel these massive transformations.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "For EnrichLA, success would be defined as a healthier, happier Los Angeles. Children in the most urban, asphalt covered areas of Los Angeles would have access to green, outdoor spaces. They would grow up learning about healthy, natural foods, and they would have access to these foods not only in the home, but in the classroom as well. They would be inspired to learn about the natural world- not forced. This education would lead to improved health, test scores, and a sense of community and environmental responsibility.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "There are both short and long term evaluations that will take place in order to determine the success and necessary revisions to our project."

    "organization": "Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force",
    "summary": "The mission of the Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force is to remove barriers to the prevention, screening and treatment of prenatal and postpartum depression in Los Angeles County. Common barriers include lack of screening, inaccessibility of informed treatment, stigma and lack of reimbursement from payors. In order to address these barriers and increase access to depression screening and treatment services for medically underserved pregnant and postpartum women, the Task Force has been working in partnership with USC-Eisner Family Medicine Clinic on the Maternal Mental Health Improvement project - a pilot project that embeds maternal mental health care in a primary care setting. USC-Eisner FMC is a federally qualified nonprofit community health center dedicated to improving the physical, social, and emotional well-being of people in Metro, South and South Central Los Angeles, regardless of their ability to pay. Its patient population includes high-risk, uninsured, under-insured and otherwise medically underserved women and their infants. According to the 2008 LAMB survey, 23.1% percent of new mothers in the catchment area served by USC-Eisner FMC reported depression during pregnancy and 58.2% reported some level of depression postpartum - a rate roughly twice that of pregnant women nationwide. In addition, many struggle with financial stress, poor social support and chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension and thyroid disease. Additional risks include linguistic barriers, immigration status, lack of health insurance, obstacles to care such as transportation and childcare, and lack of access to mental health services. As part of the Maternal Mental Health Improvement project, which is based on the IMPACT model, all prenatal and postpartum patients are screened for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders at each visit. Patients who screen positively (10 or more on the PHQ-9 or 4 or more on the Edinburgh 3) are connected with an onsite social worker, social work intern and/or occupational therapist, who conducts a full assessment of the patient. These cases are referred to the New Family Care Team, which consists of primary care physicians, social workers, occupational therapists, psychologists and case managers at USC-Eisner FMC, as well as a consulting perinatal mental health psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed marriage family therapist and a social worker. Members of the New Family Care Team meet on a weekly basis to discuss patients who have presented as high or medium risk for perinatal depression, provide expertise from members' respective disciplines and construct an optimal treatment plan for each case. Treatment options may include individual or group therapy, psychiatric care, medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy and/or psycho-dynamic psychotherapy, social support and intensive case management with warm referrals to community resources. Since January 2012, 420 pregnant and postpartum women have been screened for perinatal depression at USC-Eisner FMC. Positive screens, which account for approximately 33% of all women, are given an extensive intake assessment using a tool developed by the Task Force. The intake/assessment tool includes a comprehensive psychosocial history, including risk factors such as past trauma and loss, domestic violence, substance abuse, immigration status and social support, as well as a complete psychiatric differential diagnosis. Thus far, the intervention appears to be creating a medical home for women and their children, potentially lowering rates of fragmented medical and mental health care and addressing the physical and mental health needs of women and children. The most important observation thus far has been that time and time again, women express reluctance to being given a referral outside of the clinic, but are willing to connect with an \"emotional support person\" who is on the premises. In this way, women are far less likely to fall through the cracks. The Task Force is currently actively fundraising for the Maternal Mental Health Improvement project so that it can design a data dashboard that will track the project's outcomes. Data sets that will be collected through the dashboard will be used to inform conclusions about the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the IMPACT model of collaborative mental health care as applied to maternal depression.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force was founded in February 2007 by Special Counsel/Legislative Analyst, Kimberly Wong, following her personal experience with severe postpartum depression. The Task Force is a coalition composed of over 35 public and private non-profit agencies as well community leaders, research partners, advocates for mothers, infants, and families, survivors of maternal depression and affected family members. Through its programs and initiatives, the Task Force aims to: (1) Raise public awareness of the disorder so that women who are suffering are not ashamed or embarrassed to seek help; (2) Increase perinatal depression screening and referral rates among community and health care providers; and (3) Advocate for legislation that supports the identification and treatment of perinatal depression.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Perinatal or maternal depression encompasses a range of mood disorders that can affect a woman during pregnancy and around the time of birth. Mothers who suffer from perinatal depression are at-risk of delivering a pre-term baby, a low-birth weight baby and/or a baby with elevated stress hormones. They are also less likely breastfeed, use car seats, electrical outlet covers or smoke detectors, place her baby on his/her back to sleep, or talk, play or show books to her baby on a daily basis. A mother suffering from postpartum depression is also more likely to abuse drugs and/or alcohol, display anger and disengagement with her baby and use corporal punishment. Children of women who are suffering from perinatal depression may display poor weight gain, low self-esteem and behavioral problems. Most importantly, depression in the postpartum period interrupts healthy bonding between mother and child, leading to impaired cognitive, behavioral, and emotional development in early childhood and beyond.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The Task Force will contract with an external evaluator to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Speak Up When You're Down: Maternal Mental Health Improvement project, including qualitative and quantitative indicators of project success. Qualitative measures may include feasibility and implementation challenges and successes within the participating clinic and program, as well as program milestone achievements. Quantitative measures may include descriptive baseline measures of outcomes related to screening and access to care, implementation of screening and intervention protocols and demographic, clinical and psycho-social variables of the patients seen during the research project. Data elements will include date of birth; marital status; ethnicity; family income; insurance status; age of first prenatal visit; history of mental health; immigration status; evidence of substance abuse, domestic violence, etc. Other data will include maternal and birth outcomes."

    "summary": "Loosely based on the ubiquity of food trucks in the landscape of Los Angeles, the Potluck Truck is a mobile unit that encourages community engagement through informal cultural activities and collective meals. Moving from neighborhood to neighborhood, the Potluck Truck is a temporary community center that offers discussion groups, film screenings, and workshops all related to food and food production in Los Angeles, as well as related topics that address ideas of growth and sustenance. By not limiting itself to one location, the truck-space will interact with multiple publics and connect people in different cultural and geographic locations in the city. Our indicator is social connectedness, and the Potluck Truck brings people together. The name reflects the idea that everyone brings something to the table, metaphorically or practically, whether that be a story, seeds, a soup, or their wonderful selves. When people come together, especially when there is food involved, there is encouragement to relax, and conversations happen. Project Food LA is excited to retrofit a food truck and transform the interior space into a seed and book library, a space for people to leave poems, recipes and photos as well; the truck becomes a reflection and archive of the diversity of Los Angeles. We would joyously partner with local farmers and create programming around seasonal produce. Farmers will be invited to present about their farming practices, water conservation methods, and showcase their produce. The truck will include a film screen and pull out benches and poofs - the ability to turn an empty lot into a makeshift outdoor theatre. Food connects people; we all have to eat and the Potluck Truck uses this simple fact as a platform to challenge the normalization of areas of the city being food deserts, and the potentially isolating nature of domestic space. It harkens back to the idea of the commons, a space where everyone has a right to be, and inscribes food democracy into that shared privilege to congregate, and act, as empowered citizenry.",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles is often referred to as a city without a center, a city of multiple cities. Within this vast metropolis, many neighborhoods lack adequate public green spaces to enjoy. Only 4% of Los Angeles is devoted to public greenery, compared to 17% in New York City. Additionally, the inequitable distribution of green space is staggering, and lower income neighborhoods suffer the cost in health challenges and increased violence. Studies prove these correlations time and again. This lack of shared public space affects the ability to build relationships in the city; there are remarkably few locations to claim or meet to eat a meal. Los Angeles needs a responsive public arena - the Potluck Truck! The Potluck Truck is a mobile public space where the diverse publics of Los Angeles may choose to engage with each other and their environment, simultaneously reflecting the neighborhood’s character and the way that nature is present in the city. Using nourishment as a catalyst for social engagement, the Potluck Truck reconnects us to the history of Los Angeles as a chaparral biome and its robust farming history.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Often times, success may be evaluated in numbers: one million \"likes,\" two million \"followers,\" three million \"repins.\" As the events of the Potluck Truck may be rendered digitally in the forms of video, online blogging and publications, the Truck will eventually earn \"likes,\" \"followers\" and \"repins.\" While significant in helping to prove and proliferate success, the levels of achievement of the Potluck Truck cannot be evaluated solely on these terms.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "[Los Angeles]",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success would be perceived and visible in people willingly and eagerly showing their empowerment through active participation in the commons. This would be demonstrated, initially, through an ownership of the Potluck Truck (PT). People could suggest ideas for events that serve their community and grow the PT's exhibitions, film screenings, and contribution to the seed bank, helping to initiate contact with both new publics and connect folks with similar interests. The PT reveals the contribution of all present, shifting the focus from the creators of PT to those gathering together.",

    "summary": "CARECEN’s College Head Start program is designed to monitor participating students from 8th through 12th grade to ensure they are primed for high school graduation, college admission and academic success. According to an LAUSD Policy Bulletin, in 2012 all 9th graders will be required to complete the A-G Requirement in order to graduate from high school. At times, many students have found it difficult to complete this requirement, thus setting up students to either “flunk out” or completely disengage from school and drop out. Admission to CARECEN’s College Head Start program will require family involvement and a commitment to academic and disciplinary guidelines. Program Objective: To create a sustainable high school impact program that is geared to support students from 8th through 12th grade, by monitoring their academic progress and ensuring access to needed academic support to earn a high school diploma and prepare to attend a university, community college, vocational and/or trade school. Program Services: Students enrolled in CARECEN’s College Head Start program will receive the following services: 1. Academic Enrichment/Tutoring; 2. Academic Counseling/Internships 3. College Admissions Guidance 4. College Success and Retention Support 5. Financial Aid Counseling 6. Parent and Family Services 7. Leadership Development 8. Academic /Career Mentoring 9. SAT/ACT and Other Test Preparation Services 10. Scholarship Information. Target Population: College Head Start participants will be composed of: 9th through 12th grade high school students. However, outreach and promotion for the program will begin with middle school students (8th grade students transitioning into 9th grade); academically high and low performing; first generation students to attend college; students/families with limited financial resources, English as a Second Language (ESL) and English Language Learner (ELL) students, and AB540 students. In the first phase of the program, CARECEN will recruit students from Belmont High School’s Small Learning Communities (Belmont). Belmont is one of LAUSD’s most underperforming schools, with a graduation rate of 34%. Because Belmont is within a five-mile radius of CARECEN, we felt it was important to collaborate with them and procure a solid freshman class to participate in College Head Start and ultimately graduate high school and pursue higher academics. Once fully established, the program will include approximately 75 students from 9th to 12th grades. Program Structure: CARECEN has developed its curriculum to address and meet the needs of Pico-Union/Westlake students. CARECEN’s College Head Start model focuses on two areas: 1. Academic: The academic component has students working within a study group that is facilitated by a College Head Start tutor. Students will be grouped with other students who are taking the same course subjects and will collaborate to study the materials. For additional support or upon referral from a College Head Start counselor, students can request one-on-one tutoring with an academic tutor. 2. Leadership: Students will participate in a leadership development program where they will receive the necessary tools to become community leaders and advocates. The following are areas within the leadership program: Community Service: This component focuses on connecting students with their community. Students will work with College Head Start counselors and community leaders to seek-out a project and/or organization that best suits them in an effort to complete their volunteer hours. Given the three Belmont Academies, students will be required to do community projects based on the theme for their academy. In addition, College Head Start counselors will inform and assist students regarding internship opportunities, which they will be able to be incorporate on their resumes. History, Culture and Art: This component will focus on exploring the issue of identity, building students’ self-esteem and confidence, to enable them to graduate from high school. In the end, students will feel they are emotionally prepared for college and will most likely succeed through a seminar series based on Latino immigrant history, culture and the arts. Parents: CARECEN realizes that in order to better serve the needs of our children and youth, parents are a critical partner and have their own set of needs as they work to become better advocates who fight for their child’s education. In response to a great community need, CARECEN developed the Parent Leadership Program. This program educates parents on the basic knowledge regarding the function and structure of the school system in order to support their children’s education and develop an Individual Academic Plan to help students successfully graduate and be ready to attend a college or university. Parents will also learn how to advocate and fight for an equal and quality public education system and improved collaboration between parents and schools.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Success will be evaluated on different levels, from student engagement in workshops to the number of students that graduated from a 4-year college or higher education institution. Children’s achievements cannot be measured on numbers alone because then we would not be celebrating the personal growth of each student. Yet, we track our students from the moment they start in to the day they graduate from college. We have discovered that there is much discussion on high school dropout rates, but there is not a lot of awareness of college dropout in our community. Therefore, we measure success in 3 main sections: 1. Personal and social growth 2. Academic achievement and college readiness 3. College/higher education retention and completion.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "CARECEN’s youth and parent programs benefit the city of Los Angeles by creating a space where families can grow together as a union in pursuing a higher education and creating leaders that are active in addressing issues that affect their community. CARECEN’s education programs strive to create a space where both parents and youth can work together to address student needs that exist at local schools and the community.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "For 30 years, CARECEN has worked to empower the Central American and Latino immigrant community to fight for social and economic justice. Part of that fight has been to ensure that the children in our communities receive a quality education and cultural teachings. Through educational reform advocacy, educational programs, and active roles in the design and implementation of new school structures, CARECEN seeks solutions everyday to the obstacles our youth face in achieving success and in the development of the arts and culture component that defines their and that of their families personal struggle.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We are working with neighborhood middle schools and high schools located within 5-mile radius from the organization. We will also seek to collaborate with key universities programs such as student retention departments to assist students and parents in the college transition phase. We have strong partnerships with LAUSD, Belmont High School, University of Southern California (USC), UCLA, Cal State LA and local community colleges.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "With every generation of students that we help get into an institute of higher education the face of the Los Angeles student will be changed. Students will learn to take ownership of their education and be proud to be members of our ever-growing city. Students will learn to dream big, work hard, and give back to their community. In 2050 we hope to see a community that actively encourages students in their pursuit of a higher education."

    "summary": "CIS has been in the business of improving public safety for over 19 years. As a world champion in martial arts and kickboxing, CIS Executive Director, Blinky Rodriguez has a long history of working with youth. The work became personal in 1990 when Blinky himself fell victim to gang violence. Sonny, his 16-year-old son was killed in a drive-by shooting. In court, Blinky met the three killers face-to-face, not for retribution, but to forgive them. Through a series of meetings, he subsequently negotiated a truce, called The Valley Unity Peace Treaty, which was signed by over 75 gangs with over 1,000 members. The treaty successfully reduced gang-related deaths from 62 to 2 in the first year. The peace treaty project became CIS San Fernando Valley, a non-profit organization in 1994. Blinky approached long-time friend Bobby Arias, then Southwest Regional Director for Communities In Schools, Inc. and solicited his assistance in developing an “integrated service delivery approach” for gang youth. Since the tragedy of Sonny’s death, Blinky and Bobby have dedicated their lives to improve and promote public safety by ending youth and gang violence and helping young people transform their lives. CIS is one of the first organizations in LA to deliver services exclusively to gang-involved and gang-oriented youth and young adults within a cohesive, integrated, wrap-around service delivery strategy aimed at addressing root causes. These wrap-around services integrate violence prevention, gang intervention, parenting, mentoring, intensive case management, recreation/sports, therapeutic/mental health counseling, life skills and job development based on the individual needs of each client. A critical element within our model is engaging clients in sporting events. These sporting events displace hostility and violence and have proven to be some of the most effective CIS communal public safety intervention activities. They lead to improved quality of life and restoration of community peace, togetherness and tranquility. The idea we propose to LA2050 to improve public safety is our “CIS GAMES FOR PEACE”. The goal of CIS GAMES FOR PEACE is to showcase how CIS can prevent violence through well designed and coordinated sporting events. For example, a flag football game back in 1993 between rival gang members was the pivotal event that helped CIS solidify the historic Valley Unity Peace Treaty. This was a groundbreaking, paradigm busting, first of its kind phenomenon in the realm of peacekeeping in LA. That original football game morphed into a world renowned blueprint for peace acknowledged by the United Nations. CIS has since then conducted 252 sporting events that bring together potential enemies, reduce friction, encourages harmonious communication and prevent violence. Our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE would include a series of basketball, handball, softball and football events. We will conduct a minimum of 25 events each year partnering with Dept. of Recreation & Parks, LAPD and other law enforcement agencies and elected officials to ensure ongoing community safety. In addition, we would make boxing instruction available to this underserved population through our CIS Heart of Champions Boxing Academy. This instruction would take place at a local boxing gym where participants will receive professional boxing instruction. The Academy will provide a positive alternative to gang life for participants and significantly enhance their health, physical fitness and abilities, sense of pride, self-worth, cooperativeness and respect for others. We believe that participation in this program will have profound impact on our youth. Academy youth will be required to take our anger management/mediation class as a pre-requisite to participate in the academy. The curriculum will consist of beginning boxing and kickboxing principles. Those who wish will be allowed to participate in the Golden Gloves program facilitated by the gym. The program will provided participants with a Heart of Champions membership, T-shirt, mouthpiece and hand wraps. We feel this idea will impact public safety by reducing crime and while also improving health. Crime rates are at historic lows throughout the county. Still, the experience of crime and perceptions of safety vary widely along racial and socioeconomic lines. Areas of concentrated poverty tend to have higher rates of violent crime. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will be engaged in positive activities and away from crime. As noted by LA2050, safety and security is “a core element for the well-being of individuals and society as a whole.”2Crime can lead to loss of life and property; it has detrimental physical and mental health consequences; it can reduce economic productivity; and, most detrimentally, it creates a pervasive feeling of vulnerability. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will have ready access to mobile health screening and other services.",

In 1998, Blinky received the Medaille d’Excellence, presented in Switzerland to only 14 people worldwide in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Blinky has earned over eighty-three awards for his work. He was selected by LA Mayor James Hahn, A&E Television and their Biography series as a 2002 Biography Community Hero for his service to LA. Blinky and the staff of CIS were featured in the November 2002 Reader's Digest article on \"Everyday Heroes\". In 2003, he received the Angel of Peace Award from the Violence Prevention Coalition of Greater LA, The SFV Interfaith Council Human Relations Award, Simon Bolivar Liberty Award and was appointed by Mayor Hahn to The Commission for Children, Youth & Their Families.

Activities include basketball tournaments for youth, zumba classes and self improvement workshops for mothers and swap meets for community bargain hunting at the site. USC, UCLA, CSUN and Cal State LA will provide interns as mentors/tutors for gang youth. Mission College will provide job training, job placement, GED and other educational services.",

Specifically, our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE participants come from communities with some of the lowest income and high crime areas in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley. They face a relentless assault of negative influences that often result in drug abuse, violence, teen pregnancy, poor academic performance, even death. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will develop the skills, abilities, relationships and associations necessary to foster self-esteem, persistence, perseverance and positive attitudes to overcome negative influences."

    "summary": "The Los Angles Youth Orchestra (LAYO) gives children 8-18 who play orchestral instruments the opportunity to practice and perform in an orchestra on a regular basis. We draw students from all over Los Angeles and create a cohesive musical community in eight to ten weeks. Each semester culminates in two performances in two different locations. LAYO would like to expand participation in the orchestra through community building and outreach. We envision an orchestra that educates a larger portion of Los Angeles’s students. The 2050 funding will help us achieve this goal by funding teacher salaries, scholarships, and community outreach through student recruitment and free concerts. The future for education in the Goldhirsch report is grim; the future of arts education is worse. The first programs to get cut in most school districts are the art programs. The largest school district in Los Angeles has gutted funding for arts education, and music was the first to go. Fewer than 10% of Los Angeles Unified School District’s students receive instruction in the arts and no elementary or middle school has an instrument program. Research shows playing an instrument positively affects educational outcomes. Children who play a musical instrument are more likely to finish high school and go on to college. They perform better in math and science, and have an easier time learning languages. LAYO Impacts the city through it’s students and concerts. LAYO students excel both musically and academically. A 100% of our participants graduate high school and the majority move onto college. An educated and engaged population keeps the city economically and culturally vital. The Los Angeles Youth Orchestra orchestra started with ten kids and has grown to 80. It brings a very diverse group of students together to practice an under funded art form. The Orchestra has been in existence for thirteen years. In those thirteen years we have had thousands of students learn and perform orchestral music and have reached tens of thousands of people through our concerts. We bring students from all over Los Angeles County together to practice and perform orchestral music on Sunday afternoon from 12:00-5:00 pm. LAYO is comprised of two orchestras the Concert (intermediate) and Chamber (advanced). The success of our program is based on our mentorship model, each section has it’s own section rehearsal which enables our students to perform concerts in a relatively short time period. The goal of the orchestra is not to produce professional musicians but to create and foster a supportive community for children who love and practice classical music.",

    "summary": "The idea is to identify organizations that are actively engaged in service to their communities, and to increase their effectiveness through interconnectedness, training and support. Social connectedness, put simply, measures how people come together and interact. Believing that relationship development is one of the best means that any person or group can use to gain access to resources, we are starting the Community Builders Resource Network (CBRN). What will CBRN do exactly? It will make good organizations better. It will do this by providing training in the areas most critical to organizational success: Strategic Planning, Leadership Development, Teambuilding, Compassionate Communication, and Effective Fundraising. As a coalition of the willing – access to training will be made open to any group or organization (regardless of political, religious or sexual alignment) purposed to relieve suffering. Training will be made available for free and offered in both Spanish and English. Knowing that volunteers often play an integral role in these groups – training and workshops will be offered to accommodate a variety of schedules and will include evening and weekend opportunities. A foundation from which to build a better LA already exists. By identifying and creating a collaborative network for the already existing 501(c)3 organizations within a community – beginning with service organizations, educational facilities, and faith based organizations – we can better identify a community’s resources and thus better meet that community’s needs. There are a number of faith based organizations in my neighborhood that sit largely unpurposed during the week. Wonderful facilities with classrooms, kitchens, bathrooms and open areas that could offer any number of community services, such as: childcare, afterschool programs, ESL, literacy, First Aid, CPR, 12 Step programs, food pantries, vocational training, community gardens, etc. - are awaiting inspiration into more directed usefulness. The development of more effective social connectedness will not be limited to internally collaborative network, however. A better means of connecting these resources to the public needs to be developed and implemented. A user friendly website that serves as resource index to the public will be developed and maintained as part of this initiative. As representative of a food pantry that serves over 5,000 people monthly – and having worked as a volunteer with this organization for over 20 years, I am personally aware of and connected to a half dozen other food pantries in the Northeast San Fernando Valley. However, I just did a Google search of “food pantries San Fernando Valley” and none of these organizations came up. There is a disconnect that desperately needs to addressing – yet the organizations involved are generally running with little to no administrative overhead and are often comprised of volunteers for whom website development is either not a priority, or it lies outside of their budget or skill sets.",

Since the need to assist the hungry didn’t end once the infrastructure was repaired, neither did the FSBCS. The church is quite small; in fact, it averages less than 50 people a week for its Sunday service – yet it provides food to an average of 5,000 people per month.

    "organization": "UNIQUE LA",
    "summary": "UNIQUE LA has helped over 4000 artists/designers/entrepreneurs increase revenues and become sustainable businesses by selling their goods to the public. At the same time we've created a cultural institution and thriving community that supports local art, design, craft. It's time to take the next step in our mission of helping LA's art and design community... Our plan is to open the UNIQUE LA Creative Lab, a co-work & creative event space that would provide the much-needed tools that creative small business owners need in order to become sustainable and grow successfully. Creatives who work for themselves (artists, designers, furniture makers, freelancers, film makers, writers, etc.), are actually entrepreneurs and small business owners. They are curious, innovative and visionary... They also have to wear ALL the hats when owning a business - they are in fact their own PR firm, accounting department, marketing engine, HR manager. It's a lot to take on. They need help, guidance and a place to connect with a like-minded community so that they can thrive not just as artists but business owners. Someone who is creative should be able to be great at what they do, and make a great living doing it. UNIQUE LA’s Creative Lab will help ensure LA’s arts and culture community is growing strong, and growing smart. The Creative Lab will achieve this in two ways. First, it will provide a membership-based co-work environment, allowing people to share creative office and studio space (complete with a kitchen, board room, photo studio and more). And second, The Creative Lab will have an event space that will offer a diverse range of monthly and weekly programming, from workshops to a speaker series to parties and special events. All curated to ensure members and the public have access to continuing education, networking opportunities and inspiration. Every month we will feature a keynote speaker from world-famous artists to authors. Monthly workshops will range from “How to Find Investors” to “DIY Public Relations” to “Utilizing Social Media to Increase Profits”. Members will be invited to networking events with editors, to help them gain press attention. Trade show representatives will host How To seminars, helping designers learn how to grow by selling wholesale, instead of direct to consumer. Special events such as fashion shows will celebrate local talent and showcase new design and art. Imagine the amazing impact one space can have, when it TEACHES multiple generations how to be creative and make a living! Even better, it encourages and shows how to become a business that grows to support multiple employees! Aside from having an astounding impact on Arts & Culture in LA, The Creative Lab will actually touch on and help all eight sectors listed in the Goldhirsh Foundation’s LA2050 Report. Through programming, we will curate meaningful conversation, activities and hands-on workshops surrounding all eight areas – for instance we will host a ‘Volunteer Fair’ where local non-profits (from education to health to arts) can connect with members looking for places to volunteer. UNIQUE LA's Creative Lab is a ground-breaking new idea. The 2012 OTIS Report states \"there are more artists, writers, filmmakers, actors, dancers and musicians living and working in LA than any other city at any other time in the history of civilization.\" It's time LA got a space designed to ensure those people - the creatives that are fueling the economy - are well-trained, inspired and ready to grow.",

Essentially we've shown creatives how to be entrepreneurs, ensuring a successful and thriving creative economy. There are more artists and also more small businesses run by artists. When asked what they'd like to be when they grow up, children give answers such as Furniture Designer and Architect just as often as Doctor and Lawyer. Our view of 2050 is that we've grown LA's creative economy to be the best in the world, with bright stars and smart business owners. The Artist is no longer starving but successful and happy.",

    "organization": "ESP Empowering Services Through Partnerships",
    "summary": "ESP Empowering Services Through Partnerships 501(c)(3) created the Team Teacher Service Learning Project (TTSLP). The TTSLP encompasses the idea of reducing the student-teacher ratio by 50% (2 teachers per 30-40 students). By providing an additional teacher, Team Teacher Service Learning Project (TTSLP), to service those classes that are in the greatest need, students are again afforded an opportunity of a quality education and can once again use the teacher as a resource and a facilitator of the actual learning process. III.\tOur Vision ESP Empowering Services Through Partnerships 501(c)(3) idea will improve Los Angeles and positively impact Education and Social Connectedness, 2 of the 8 indicators. Our vision encompasses partnering to educate our youth on the core content standards while engaging them in Service Learning Projects. IV. Service Learning Service learning is a teaching strategy that combines meaningful service to the community with acquisition of academic learning and skills. The Team Teacher Service Learning Project is a service learning project that encompasses all of the core curriculum areas of English Language Arts, Science, Technology, Engineering, Fine Arts, Math, and the Social Sciences. While students are learning the content areas, they are engaged in the process of relating it to a real life experience that can directly impact their community and streaming it towards Sustainability: using the acquired knowledge and skills to sustain their learning and their community. This learning through service approach not only provides a meaningful approach to learning the content areas but also builds a sense of community, responsibility, awareness, and self-esteem. Overall, students will serve as active participants who are actively engaged within their learning which will directly improve their academic performance and increase academic achievement. By teaching the content through service learning projects, students will be more socially conscious and active toward issues concerning their communities. Consequently, they will become more engaged in the actual learning process while serving their community. Moreover, this experience will drive them to a more successful and meaningful learning path and thus creating productive community-based citizens. Students will be able to use these acquired skills throughout their educational careers as well as throughout life. In addition, values of service, empathy, and community building will be instilled from an early stage and students will be engaged in the process of community sustainability. V. ESP Team Teacher Service Learning Project The TTSLP instructor is a highly qualified credentialed educators. He/she will serve as a co-teacher that enhance the primary teacher's content by engaging students in Service Learning Opportunities. While providing additional support, the primary teacher will be afforded opportunities to prioritize instruction based on student individual needs. Subsequently, students will be able to access the core curriculum and serve their community; thus resulting in academic success—as proven by the decrease in drop-out rates, and increases in proficiency level within the core content, Academic Performance Index, social skills, and community building. Prior to the lessons, both teachers would collaborate on the goals and objectives of the content core standards. Teachers would initiate learning talks engaging students on becoming socially conscious learners. During this process students will be taught the process of the strategic thinking where they conduct needs assessments and goal setting as it relates to students and community members. Subsequently, teachers begin to facilitate service learning projects that would incorporate the identified needs and the core content learning standards. An example would be a Geometry class learning about the area and perimeter formula and taking this information and applying it to a Service Learning gardening project.",

    "organization": "smartestk12.com",
    "summary": "By 2050, the injustice that is the education gap must be defeated. There is no panacea and the answer is not as simple as choosing charter schools, dethroning Unions, or betting the house on a learning style. There will never be a silver bullet, but the closest answer that we have is a full focus on tracking student data and promoting teacher effectiveness. Thankfully, the Common Core State Standards combined with LA’s digital revolution enable a rare chance to understand and to address individual student knowledge gaps and to promote school successes in real time. Smartestk12.com is a website for teachers to upload their tests and quizzes into one unified database. Once uploaded, the site will strip unnecessary formatting of word documents and pdfs to enable a virtually limitless array of standards-aligned questions for each grade level and subject matter. Like searching for an image on google, teachers will now be able to effortlessly find the best questions for their lessons. Meanwhile, the teacher community can edit, moderate and improve the resources to create the smartest test solutions for our students. The real magic is what we can do for students. For the first time ever, we will be able to provide a khanacademy-esque practice world for all content areas, including essay-formatted ELA questions. Each student may log in and take their teacher’s assessments online and be recommended for the best computer adaptive practice. The data generated by this site automatically builds individual reports for instant tracking to schools as well as parents via email and text messages. Our computer adaptive platform discovers areas of student learning deficiencies and then presents aid for that material in an actionable manner to all parties, including the students themselves; all instantly. Beyond the benefits of measured student growth, smartestk12 also addresses three critical education events: LAUSD's tablet/chromebook push, the common core, and teacher evaluation. First, as a former intern at Beaudry through the Teach For America Summer Leadership Fellows Program, our founder worked with Superintendents Dr. John Deasy and Tommy Chang. In this position, he was intimately seated with the small data team and IT department. With the recent announcement for LAUSD to buy 600,000 chromebooks, as well as the thousands of iPads and other digital media ordered in this latest $500,000,000 spending spree, it is clear that LAUSD is serious about their commitment to fully digitize the district. However, it is fair to be extremely skeptical that the immense resources will be utilized to their fullest extent in the coming tech roll-out. Instead of focusing on best-practices, the limited LAUSD team is tied to the logistics involved in delivering the devices. My district office friends admit the heavy need for more programs put in place to ensure that the new devices will have true accountability. Smartestk12 can provide such accountability through daily/weekly interim assessments for each student, using our virtually unlimited database of questions and computer adaptive technique. In order to achieve audacious growth, we can provide a robust intervention plan for all students in need. Once ready, smartestk12 is set to immediately support several schools within LAUSD, and plans to work directly with the SIS system for easy integration. Second, the Common Core State Standards will begin in the 2014-2015 school year. While Los Angeles appears to be on the leading edge with the Common Core implementation, it is still highly debatable if any success will occur in the transition. Rather than gambling on our students, smartestk12 is focused on providing leading content, teacher-made for LA’s classrooms. Beyond the best teachers, we aim to license pre-existing databases such as Teach For America and Khanacademy. Third, the current federal and state requirements are now set to include test scores into teacher evaluations. Smartestk12 will not only reduce the heavy weight on end of year high-stakes testing, but also facilitate more authentic time management for teachers, by eliminating test reinvention. Without testing, too many teachers hide within the system or are not recognized. Also, too many students fall behind. Now, smartestk12 will provide a way to showcase student growth for any teacher by breaking the high stakes tests into daily or weekly interim assessments. Not only will teachers see results immediately; but now, parents, administrators and the students themselves will know exactly where they are succeeding or falling behind and can use our website for enrichment and intervention. Smartestk12 is a start-up, launched in 2013 in UCLA Anderson’s MBA school and received angel funding from the Larry Wolfen Foundation. LA schools are already signing up to use smartestk12, but the opportunity to succeed hinges on financial support.",

The students wanted to succeed, and virtually each student who attended the study workshop achieved academic results far beyond what was \"expected\" of them. That first workshop was the icing on the cake of a record-breaking academic year for 8th grade science at South Gate Middle School. However, while 86% of students passed their science exam, only 14% of students passed in mathematics.",

True to our name, if we can not measure it then we can not be sure of its importance. Of paramount importance, success will be measured in the percent of students who grow beyond expected results, the up-take rate and attrition rate of the website, the number of students served and the long-term effect of any growth. Of particular interest will be which students are served the most and whether the intervention adequately serves its role. Constant refinement is necessary to validate that growth is a result of our support. Pyschometric analysis is key to validate any findings.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In 2050, digital devices would support brick and mortar classrooms in such a way that 100% of in-class time is devoted to authentic critical thinking and hands-on inquiry. Smartestk12 will not limit a teacher to test prep but instead widen their scope to what truly leads to results. Our data driven system will expose the real success stories in schools across the region and will enable specific, individualized instruction, as opposed to a one-sized fits all methodology."

    "summary": "START SEEING UGLY! is proposed as a riveting demonstration of how emerging personal technologies and social media can—and most definitely will—become empowering tools for educating, engaging, connecting and organizing those living in community. The result will be a new twist on social connectedness, collective civic action and community empowerment where smartphones are put to use as instruments of social synergy.\n\nMaterials & Applications (M&A), a 501(c)(3) corporation, proposes to create a set of online social outreach tools under its Urban Applications initiative for just such purposes. START SEEING UGLY! will empower anyone with a Smartphone or digital camera to take photos of physical blight in any community in Los Angeles and upload them to a correlated website database that will “pin” the geotagged shots onto a map - creating a hub for social action by community stakeholders. START SEEING UGLY! will both promote and support social connectedness for civic engagement in a breathtaking display of participatory democracy.\n\nM&A, as a group of online media developers, artists, architects, ecologists, urban planning students and other volunteers working in artistic fields, is interested in recruiting ordinary citizens in a sustainable campaign to clean up L.A. streets using processes of co-creation. By moving the participating public—especially young people—through a contiguous series of personal and collective commitments, we feel that we can help to transform our city—and our people—in positive ways for the future. Borrowing from an architectural concept, “urban acupuncture,” in which strategic small scale interventions have radiating effects, we expect to reset the power and energies of local distressed communities, one by one.\n\nBuilding on prior experience in organizing communities to create public art that galvanizes public interest for environmental solutions, we will identify parcels of land that deteriorate the environmental, social and economic health of neighborhoods. Citizens will be invited to document these parcels and add them to the START SEEING UGLY! website-hosted database and mapping system. M&A will then work with community stakeholders to find solutions that are supported by the collective will and resource bank.\n\nThe first step, CONNECTION, is to encourage local citizens to see—really see—the decayed areas that they pass through each day and often ignore. We expect this project and its promotion will pull community stakeholders out of their complacency and into awareness. By having a platform on which to share what they see, participants will have stepped into a first level of personal responsibility for their community.\n\nThe second step, ANALYSIS, is for M&A and community partners to analyze the sites identified, using matrices that will track the greatest concentrations of photos and reportings, compare and sort them, amass demographic and land parcel data from city and other databases, and, with community input, prioritize them for action based on public interest and urgency.\n\nThe third step, TRANSFORMATION, is for M&A and its volunteers to connect to the sources of power who can investigate and negotiate solutions—City Council, City Planning and Cultural Affairs Departments, other governmental agencies, community organizations, and the private sector. In addition to spurring others to action, M&A will be alert for projects that deal with watershed and other environmental issues that could have a public art component. M&A supports the efficacy of working with community residents to plan and erect monuments to their successes in community engagement.\n\nFor example, M&A is now developing a public art element for a project in Sun Valley spearheaded by the Council for Watershed Health (CWH). CWH’s Elmer Avenue Neighborhood Retrofit Project transformed an under-served urban neighborhood into a urban ecosystem. Phase I of the project employed ecological strategies as well as community-engaged design to transform traditional front yards and a residential street into a system for water harvesting and conserving; climate appropriate landscaping; and recapturing stormwater to replenish groundwater supplies in the Los Angeles River Watershed. In Phase II, residents were engaged in the transformation of a blighted alleyway into a new Paseo, a community pathway integrated with stormwater management improvements.\n\nM&A is working with CWH to expand on these efforts by engaging residents, schools and other community stakeholders to explore and interact with the new ecosystem through public art, environmental education, and community engagement. In so doing we are creating a model for building social cohesion and public art around community issues.\n\nOur video is the vision of START SEEING UGLY! as a citywide strategy to promote social connectedness and civic action in Los Angeles.",

By hosting 6 artists in the coming year Human Resources L.A. (HRLA) would act as a frame for a diverse set of vital yet under supported artist practices already occurring in Los Angeles. Each artist would be given studio space, a stipend and be asked to contribute to a public program that engages the city of Los Angeles. The residency would promote exchange between these co-occurring artist practices as well as foster educational and community impact; contextualizing the work in a non-commercial environment in order to bring global attention to the city of Los Angels as an international arena for culture and the arts. Our goal in supporting our residents would be to create an exceptional environment in which to further personal practices while engaging them in HRLA’s existing community and beyond. Community outreach will be activated by facilitating exhibition, performance, publication and symposium inside our existing Chinatown gallery space and institutional frame as well as activating our partners – including major institutions, galleries and fellow artist-run spaces.

Artist residencies provide environments for artist to flourish not only in their private practice but also in unexpected conversation with the larger community. Artist residencies become active breeding grounds for experimental practices, educational outreach and exchange. Any established global arts city must competitively foster a vital artist residency program that facilitates the production and practice of crucial working artists first locally and then beyond as it promote its cultural production abroad. HRLA Artist Residency Program would work towards creating supported space for creative thinking, action and education with the mission to prove that art, creativity, critical discourse and cooperation promotes a higher quality of life and engaging of mind for all members of a society."

CHH is a week-long interactive arts experience for youth impacted by HIV/AIDS. Participants from ages 15-21 primarily from Los Angeles have the opportunity to explore, by choice, one of seven arts disciplines: acting, creative writing, culinary arts, documentary filmmaking, fashion, music, and visual arts. CHH enhances human development because our youth are given the opportunity to interact positively with arts professionals and one another as they explore their creativity and receive both personal and career-centered insight. Led by experienced artists and mentors, participants enjoy comprehensive instruction and training in their chosen art, steering them in the right direction for pursuing their creative passions. The camp culminates with a professionally produced live performance, empowering our young artists to showcase their creativity and artistic vision with the entire camp community. The opportunity to celebrate each other’s talents is an experience that brings smiles, pride, and confidence to the participants for years to come. The campers also get to choose exciting elective programming such as comic book artistry, fashion design, culinary arts, stunt choreography, and photography, providing campers with a well-rounded experience beyond their initial focus. In addition to electives and focused workshops, camp provides a variety of fun, enlightening experiences ranging from the exciting talent showcases by well-known entertainers to beach time, sports, and games. Before departing camp each participant is provided with a resource packet full of information and direction on how to further their professional development. The week at CHH allows participants to understand the responsibilities of adulthood and build self-esteem in a trusted, caring, and fun environment.",

Low levels of educational and economic achievement, a high incidence of violence and crime, shorter life expectancies, and skyrocketing disease rates characterize cities where people are most disengaged from community. In its vast sprawl, Los Angeles has lost a core sense of connectedness, leaving its residents too vulnerable to the alarming indicators correlated with isolation: the erosion of social capital for those who most need it, the loss of social and interpersonal skills particularly among youth, the crumbling of a reliable ground for public dialogue on issues critical to our city, and the associated impact on our ability to make important decisions together.",

Ultimately success will be measured by the outcomes of the proposal writing process: (1) Does it mirror our highest intentions of designing a Mindful pedagogical approach to curriculum, instruction, assessment, teacher education AND also meet the expectations of the Common Core? (2) Does the teacher education program teach teachers to teach in creative and playful and active ways - does it inspire them to inspire the students? (3) Does the project attract partnerships and collaborators who will speak for it at the LAUSD hearing (if we submit as a charter) (4) Does LAUSD accept the proposal and will El Rio move forward in 2014-2015 school years as an LAUSD publicly chartered school or an LAUSD pilot school?",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Research Institute for Waldorf Education",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "(1) People in LA will evaluate education in light mindfulness and the age-fitness of the program for children and adolescents as well as the test scores and social equity. A \"good\" school will be a challenging, mindful, age-fit place where children love to go and enjoy learning and are successful learners. (2) Teachers in LA will have a new hope for their profession as creative, engaging, and powerful. (3) LAUSD schools ADA funding model provides at least $15,000 per year per student as opposed to the current $5,000. As less funding has to go to fixing problems downstream, more funds will go to educating teachers in mindfulness and age-fit instructional capabilities. This will free up funds to go to autonomy in the classroom and less to minding from the top.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "El Rio Schools is a new non-profit; our most important achievement, to date, is regularly attended workshops, playgroups and informational gatherings at the Audubon Center at Debs Park of parents in Northeast Los who have an interest in mindfulness in secular public education. We are building the social network for mindfulness in education in Northeast Los Angeles.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles benefits when our public education system serves the needs of the 21st century: People who can initiate and create the new world of work, playful emotionally resilient socially aware people, and people who can think deeply and with imagination. These 21st century needs will be met when our educational system changes to one that is based on a biologically, psychologically, and ontologically correct concept of the human mind in childhood and adolescence. We call this \"mind-fit\" education. Mind-fit education is mindful education because it enters the reality of the child. When the curriculum, teaching methods, and methods of assessment work in synchronicity with the student's developmental age and individual strengths and capacities learning is irresistible. Educational success, and life success, begins at the K-8. The Mindful Education for LAUSD project will be a test-bed demonstrating its value for every student and especially for traditionally hard-to-reach students. Part of the project will be to track the data-points of success - attendance, engagement, behaviour, and initiative as well as on traditional metrics."

NYA is building that better future, one life at a time. One in four LAUSD students will not graduate from high school; only 48% score as proficient in English on standardized tests; and only 46% score as proficient in math. At NYA, 80% of NYA students significantly improve their math and English skills each year and 100% of high school seniors graduate on time and go on to college! Most are the first in their families to go to college. NYA’s Personal Best program picks up where schools leave off, providing low income and at-risk youth with rigorous, individualized academic and social support during the afterschool hours. Beyond high school, NYA provides a range of support services designed to ensure that disadvantaged and first generation college students complete their degrees. Youth can start with NYA as early as first grade and continue all the way through college. Of the nearly 200 young people currently served by NYA, 99% are Latino, 1% are African American, 92% do not speak English at home, 98% are being raised by a parent or parents who did not attend college, and all are low income. Despite these challenges, NYA’s students and alumni remain committed to their education. Some travel as many as three hours each way by bus to attend a university. These young people know that they are building a better future for themselves and for their families. “I have to set the example and by going to college I can show my siblings that it is possible to accomplish their goals if they strive towards them and put in the effort.” – NYA high school senior NYA has developed, tested and tracked a highly successful proprietary curriculum. NYA’s Personal Best curriculum stresses the development of strong math and English skills, STEM literacy, college planning and preparation, critical thinking, and leadership. Each student undergoes an extensive academic and social assessment. Targeted interventions such as one-on-one tutoring or counseling are integrated into each student’s “afterschool day” along with activities such as project-based learning, group activities, competitions, peer mentoring and learning games. Students’ progress toward academic goals is evaluated as often as every week and adjustments are made as needed to ensure that each student receives the support they need to achieve success. “Whether it may be academically or personally, NYA is a place where knowledge is cultivated and encouraged to flourish. Being a part of the program has been very impactful to me, and I will take everything I learned at NYA with me, because it has shaped me into a better person”. – NYA high school senior",

If programs addressing social concerns like economic development, early education, and community safety are like a kind of “social software,” then SBCC's approach differs from the standard practice of installing off-the-shelf products on every system (i.e., neighborhood).

    "organization": "Affordable Living for the Aging",
    "summary": "In addition to rising healthcare costs and lower public benefits for vulnerable populations, the most taxing cost burden on older adults is housing. Today, approximately 13 million older Americas cannot afford their housing costs. Many are forced to choose between paying their mortgage or rent and buying groceries or medicine. In response, ALA is leading a national effort to expand its shared housing program so that all individuals in need have access to safe and supportive housing options as they age. Although particularly beneficial for seniors on fixed incomes and those risking isolation, the shared housing movement goes beyond addressing the needs of any single user group. Shared housing provides opportunities for anyone interested in fostering social connections and remaining integrated in their community while accessing affordable housing. When a program is delivered by an experienced housing or social service agency, the model is also well suited for supporting veterans, single mothers and other vulnerable individuals. Shared housing is a simple idea. One individual, typically a homeowner, offers accommodation to another in exchange for rent, help around the house or light caregiving support. Home “sharees” have access to a blend of private and communal space. Even when the primary motivation for sharing is financial, many individuals enjoy the added benefits of companionship and shared responsibilities that come with cooperative living. ALA is positioned to build upon our four decades of experience to scale our shared housing program for the benefit of more individuals and entire communities. To attract a wider audience of home sharers, ALA will create a compelling and engaging viral and social media campaign that emphasizes the benefits of shared housing. The campaign will stimulate interest among potential sharers and spark conversations about how communities can use shared housing to achieve their affordable housing goals. ALA staff, in partnership with the Enterprise Community Foundation, will continue to train and educate other agencies who will help support the increased demand for services.",

To evaluate increased awareness and a shift in attitude toward shared housing, ALA will use the number of new program enrollees as a measureable outcome. Engagement metrics will measure the means by which the message is reaching a broader audience (social media, public relations activity, advertising or other). Measures will also look at the quantity and profile of individuals who are responding to shared housing campaign-related content.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "In the 35 years since ALA was founded, we have helped more than 30,000 seniors in their search for safe, stable housing that preserves their dignity and independence and keeps them engaged in their communities.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "LA’s future as a thriving metropolis relies on providing a housing supply that supports individual stability, keeps people connected to the places where they live, and makes communities more vibrant, diverse and supportive. Shared housing does this by capturing the inventory of available units, rather than relying solely on the production of new units.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "ALA will enlist the participation of organizations like SHARE!, New Directions, and CoAbode, as well as other housing coalitions interested in offering shared housing services in their communities and participating in the public education campaign.",

By 2050, Los Angeles has the potential to become a thriving network of neighborhoods where people can access a variety of housing types that match their current situation.

    "summary": "Wouldn’t it be great if your college student ID was also your transit pass? It is if your student ID is from Santa Monica College and you get to ride “Any Line, Any Time” on the Big Blue Bus. It’s a triple win – for students, transit agencies and colleges. Students get to ride “Any Line, Any Time” for a nominal fee each semester, the transit agency has more riders, and the college doesn’t have to build so much parking. Whether or not you’re a student you benefit from less traffic in the neighborhoods surrounding colleges and less air pollution in the LA Basin. With less driving, lower greenhouse gases and less emissions, the environment and our health are the really big winners. That’s why we call it “Student Eco Riders.” Here’s how it works in Santa Monica. Fourteen dollars of the student body fee each Santa Monica College student pays go towards “purchasing” the transit passes each semester. Santa Monica College also kicks in some money, too. The Big Blue Bus gets additional revenues and additional riders allowing them to increase bus service. The student ID is a smart card that is programed to work on the Big Blue Bus. Students at 10 other Southland colleges also ride free on any line at any time -- CSU Long Beach, UC Riverside, Chaffey College, Crafton Hills College, San Bernardino Valley College, Rio Hondo College, Riverside City College, California Baptist University, La Sierra University and Mt. San Jacinto College. It’s time to get more colleges and more students on transit! Under the banner of Student Eco Riders, Move LA wants to bring together other transit agencies, colleges and student governments to get them all jazzed up about the possibilities and particulars of getting college students unlimited access to transit. We’ll convene key players to talk about what has worked and what could be better using the experience in Santa Monica with the Big Blue Bus, in Long Beach with Long Beach Transit, in Riverside with the Riverside Transit Agency and in San Bernardino with Omnitrans. We’ll find the right people at the colleges, transit agencies and student governments who want to make this happen and bring them together to push forward on new agreements covering many more students. Student Eco Riders hits several bottom lines for the LA we’d all like to see in 2050. Fewer people driving means cleaner air, which we need way more of in smoggy Los Angeles -- for the environment and for our health. Getting by with one less car has a huge positive impact on your pocketbook to the tune of $8,000/year per car – a major income boost for most people. And there’s nothing like a transit system that everyone uses to increase the social connectedness in a place. What are we waiting for: Vote for Move LA’s Student Eco Riders!",

That’s what we did in 2008 when we convened representatives from labor, business, and environmental groups to get Measure R on the ballot which has proven to be a game changer for transit in Los Angeles County. With Student Eco Riders we will reach out to municipal bus agencies and LA Metro, and to student governments and administrations at universities and community colleges. The focus would be on the larger community colleges and universities and the municipal bus lines, including Metro, that serve those campuses.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Transportation may not be a key indicator for LA 2050, but how we get around certainly impacts many other key indicators including the environment, health, social connectedness, income and employment and access to opportunity.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Transit is expanding in LA County thanks to voter-approved Measure R. We’ll get seven new light rail, subway and bus rapid transit lines over the next 30 years – or possibly sooner if our efforts to accelerate the construction are successful. Building ridership for the bigger and better transit is key to getting the environmental benefits we’re after."

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "As the re-purposing of downtown Los Angeles continues apace, an eclectic mix of urban functions is taking root including commercial, residential, recreational, and social. The industrial district or Skid Row section of downtown currently hosts functions as diverse as wholesaling, retailing, warehousing, nightlife, housing as well as an array of social services. But in many of these areas there has been a lag in commensurate infrastructure development (which stands in stark contrast to other downtown districts which have experienced significant attention and investment in recent years). While this lag is evident on many levels, one in particular stands out: greening. As the industrial district/Skid Row area increasingly accommodates a diverse set of activities, in many cases it continues to exude a grim sun-bleached austerity more in keeping with it's original single purpose function."

Nearly half of LA’s households do not earn enough to meet basic expenses. The region lacks adequate well-paying jobs in growth sectors; this lack of opportunity is compounded for low-income and minority households by the poor education system. For many households, entrepreneurship is a primary route to financial stability. Small business ownership creates opportunities for families living in poverty to pursue stability and economic mobility, while creating jobs in their communities. Research has shown that if one in three microenterprises hired an additional person, the U.S. would return to full employment; if every microbusiness generated $5,000 more annually, this would add $20B to the economy. Yet only 50% of small businesses survive, often due to an inability to access the capital they need to grow because of language and cultural barriers, limited assets, low capital needs, and poor/insufficient credit.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Opportunity Fund has a vision that every small business in Los Angeles can access the financing and support needed to realize its full potential to create wealth and jobs. While we have no illusions that our microloans can eradicate income inequality, we believe that strong investment in the region’s small business community can drive economic growth and create jobs that offer a living wage. Many of LA’s most economically distressed neighborhoods are also hotbeds of entrepreneurial activity. By providing access to capital and support for these small businesses, Opportunity Fund can help them grow and thrive—offering a path to financial stability and economic mobility.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Opportunity Fund has a vision that every small business in California can access the financing and support needed to realize its full potential to create wealth and jobs. Since 1995, we have originated over 3,200 loans, totaling $35 million, to disadvantaged microentrepreneurs in California’s largest urban centers. As noted above, our borrowers have an 85% business survival rate, and each Opportunity Fund loan creates or maintains an average of 2.5 jobs. Additionally, Opportunity Fund’s loans result in a “ripple effect” of new revenues, wages, and taxes—every $1 we lend generates nearly $2 in new annual economic activity.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Opportunity Fund is pioneering a new approach to small business support that combines a mission-driven strategy and commitment to impact measurement with the market knowledge, efficiency, and reach needed to make a sustained difference in the lives and livelihoods of Los Angeles’ small business owners. By deploying capital to low-income, underserved small business owners, our microlending program helps drive small business growth and job creation in the communities that need it most.",

    "slug": "2013/turn-up-the-turn-out-engaging-la-s-voters-through-advanced-technology-in-lowincome-neighborhoods",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education (SCOPE) & US Green Building Council Los Angeles Chapter (USGBC-LA)",
    "summary": "In LA City’s March 5th local primary election, only 16% of registered voters cast a ballot, with especially poor turnout in low-income neighborhoods throughout the City. California Calls proposes to reclaim democracy in the City of Angels by significantly increasing voter outreach, education and engagement in Los Angeles. We will increase the connectedness of LA’s voters by experimenting with both proven and new methods of voter engagement. Building upon a one-to-one voter contact model developed over four years by California Calls, we will engage an estimated 120,000 voters in Los Angeles during 2013. We expect that by the June 2014 primary election in Los Angeles, the voters we have contacted will demonstrate a 5% to 8% increase in their voting rates as compared to the average voter. Our program will target South and East Los Angeles, focusing on new, unlikely and occasional voters. This is a wholly different strategy than most political campaigns which focus on “always” voters who are older, more upper income and less racially diverse than Los Angeles. Our goal is to make the Los Angeles electorate reflect the diversity of LA’s residents. In turn, this will lead to local elected officials and public policies that better serve the interests of the vast majority of the City’s diverse population. Our proven approach will be supplemented with new technologies to help boost volunteer efficiency and overall voter engagement through three key strategies: 1.\tSMART PHONES SPEED UP DOOR-TO-DOOR VOTER CONTACT California Calls will provide training, technology support and database management to four community-based organizations in LA County who will visit voters door-to-door in the early Summer and Fall of 2013. We will equip community volunteers and daily team members with 100 “smart phones” to greatly increase their efficiency and allow them to contact more voters. They will: •find voters’ addresses quickly by using the phone’s GIS mapping function •input new information about the voter (e.g., phone, email, key interests) into the database, eliminating the need for document scanning •go “green” by eliminating paper documents •provide team captains with a real-time system to monitor and assist field canvassers California Calls plans to contact a total of 24,000 voters at their front door during the two cycles. The Smart Phones will increase contacts by roughly 10%, expanding our total outreach to 26,400 voters. We will collect phone numbers, emails and other voter data on all 26,400 voters for ongoing use in voter civic engagement through programs described below. 2. TELEPHONE TOWN HALLS CONNECT LOW-PROPENSITY VOTERS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT Based on successful experience by U.S. Congresswoman Karen Bass who regularly communicates with her constituents in Los Angeles, we propose a series of five “Telephone Town Halls” with LA voters to introduce them to the new Mayor and new City Council members who will take office on July 1, 2013. Using web-based technology, roughly 20,000 voters are dialed in the early evening and invited to listen to a short update from the Mayor or Council representative. Typically about 10% (2,000) choose to listen. After a short presentation, voters are invited to ask questions and discuss. The Telephone Town Hall can offer live translation into Spanish and other languages. We propose to conduct five Telephone Town Halls during 2013 with voters in South and East Los Angeles, reaching about 10,000 voters. We will hold one Citywide Tele-Town Hall with the new Mayor and four Tele-Town Halls with Council representatives from districts where our four community organizations are located. This new technology provides a unique and meaningful opportunity for voters to connect to their elected representatives, and provides California Calls and its member groups an opportunity to identify and involve voters who express interest in civic affairs for future follow-up. 3. VOTER OUTREACH PHONEBANK USING DIALER TECHNOLOGY California Calls will add one Voter Outreach Phone bank to its 2013 program to contact an additional 23,000 LA voters. We use a sophisticated, large-scale predictive dialing system which eliminates answering machines and “not homes”, and puts phoners directly into conversation with “live” voters. The four LA-based groups who contact voters will survey them on current policy issues and invite them to the Telephone-Town Halls and other community meetings. Interested voters will also become part of California Calls’ database file for use in mobilizing voter turnout for the June 2014 gubernatorial primary election. By integrating these three advanced technologies with the “human touch” that is offered by our community volunteers and team members, we will expand our LA voter outreach by more than 35,000 contacts, for a total civic engagement program of nearly 120,000 voters.",
    "goal": null,
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "California Calls’ voter engagement program will help to reclaim the democratic process that now belongs to special interests, lobbyists and campaign committees. We encourage low-income voters to exercise their democratic right to vote with stunning success. The simple reason is that our “messengers”—the volunteers and team members who reach out to voters—are peers. Through the community-based organizations which operate these programs, young, bi-lingual people of color serve as door-to-door canvassers and phone bankers who talk to voters. They establish a rapport that earns the trust of skeptical voters.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "By 2050, we envision that Los Angeles would continue to evolve as a global city with one of the most diverse and international populations of any world megalopolis. But, in contrast to today, we would expect to see one of the most active and engaged citizenries in the world.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "California Calls is a statewide alliance of community-based organizations working to win systemic public policy reforms to achieve progressive taxation, stable funding for public services, government responsiveness to community needs, and high-road economic growth. With 31 community groups organized in 11 strategic counties, California Calls is mounting a long-term, ambitious civic engagement program to build a powerful base of voters in low-income and immigrant communities of color, with a special focus on educating and turning out new, occasional and young voters.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Four community groups are members of California Calls and will lead the one-to-one voter contact to engage low-income Latino, African-American and Asian Pacific Islander voters. All have years of community organizing experience in their neighborhoods:",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "California Calls is a metrics-driven organization. We use sophisticated data analysis, tracking, reporting and real-time evaluation methods to gauge whether we are meeting our numeric targets for voter contacts, identification and education."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Climate Resolve",
    "summary": "In 2050, Los Angeles will be 4 to 5 degrees hotter, access to water vastly diminished, wildfires and flooding more intense and frequent, and the sea level will be 5 to 9 inches higher, all because of climate change. The good news is there is plenty we can do to get ready for these changes, reduce impacts, and, most importantly, make Los Angeles a better place to live. To have a great LA in 2050, we have to start now.\n\nClimate Resolve will use the LA2050 award to galvanize Los Angeles to become better prepared, safer, and more prosperous in the face of a changing climate. We will (1) release three new studies on how the climate will change in Los Angeles by 2050, (2) hold two community climate meet-ups to initiate action on climate solutions, and (3) install a cool roof on low-income apartments to demonstrate a proven solution.\n\nSEEING LA’S CLIMATE FUTURE\n\nFirst, we will work with our partners at UCLA to ensure that Angelenos understand the emerging science on LA area climate impacts, using our proven communications strategy. UCLA scientists are modeling what LA will look like in 2050. And Climate Resolve is shaping that vision. May to September 2013, Climate Resolve will assist UCLA in the release of climate studies on changes in snowfall in our local mountains, LA area precipitation, and Santa Ana wind conditions by 2050. Climate Resolve help people understand how these studies will affect their lives. Similar to the mid-century temperature study (described below), we will work with media to help ensure the science gets reported accurately and is relatable to the public. We will design maps, graphics, and posters that readily describe the findings in an accessible way, and incorporate the studies into the website C-CHANGE.LA so people can continue to have access to the latest science.\n\nCLIMATE MEET-UPS: BUILDING RESILIENCE IN LA NEIGHBORHOODS\n\nNot just reporting on our future but creating it, Climate Resolve will work with local leaders in two LA communities to look at neighborhood-scale impacts, and identify real, positive solutions that work in these neighborhoods. During the Fall and Winter of 2013, Climate Resolve will host two intensive community climate meet-ups through which we will work with community leaders, invite trusted messengers, and listen to community concerns. We anticipate engaging our partners in this phase to bring together the collective expertise and leadership on community engagement and environmental stewardship in Los Angeles. UCLA scientists will discuss climate impacts. Environmental practitioners will share solutions they have successfully employed around the city.\n\nEach community climate meet-up will have two phases, beginning virtually with live Twitter parties where we engage community members in rapid, thoughtful, and inspiriting dialogue about climate impacts and solutions. One week later, we will host a follow-on in-person meet-up with the agenda informed by the outcomes of the Twitter party. The in-person meet-up will bring community members together with civic and environmental leaders to collectively identify policy measures and real, tangible actions that will prepare Los Angeles for a changing climate. The climate meet-up process will enable the people of Los Angeles to develop and implement solutions for their communities, working jointly with local environmental leaders, academic experts, and Climate Resolve. The result will be identification and action on priority community projects, such as installing a cool roof on a low-income apartment, a shady park with a cool playground, or a greenway along a stretch of accessible waterway.\n\nThe climate meet-ups will result in action, the beginning of Los Angeles building-up the social infrastructure to meet the climate crisis. Climate Resolve will work with our partners, including the City of Los Angeles, to obtain resources and get the job done. With Climate Resolve’s strong relationships at City Hall, we anticipate great success. When proven effective, we will expend the climate meet-up model citywide, continuing beyond the LA2050 project.\n\nSHARING SUCCESS: INSPIRING ANGELENOS TO TAKE ACTION\n\nWe will promote success stories via Twitter, Facebook and other social media, providing a place for people to post pictures and videos of what they’re able to accomplish in their neighborhood or home or school. This will show people how easy it can be to take action.\n\nMAKE LA COOL: START WITH WHAT WORKS\n\nCool roofs are a low-cost, accessible and proven solution to keeping Angelenos comfortable and safe, reducing air conditioning costs, and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. For LA2050, Climate Resolve will spearhead a project to outfit an existing low-income apartment building in Los Angeles with a cool roof. We will work with residents to help track comfort and cost-savings as a proof of concept that cool roofs are an effective solution.",

    "summary": "\"The future of the city is walking. Redesigning our cities for walkers and walking will help make our cities places where people want to be. But it’s not something we consciously think about. So every time you’re out there walking I want you to think “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” — Alissa Walker, Journalist and Los Angeles Walks Steering Committee member, at WIRED 2012 Last December, Alissa’s talk at the WIRED 2012 conference in London became a dinner table discussion at a Los Angeles Walks meeting. We laughed over the clip Alissa referenced from Midnight Cowboy where Dustin Hoffman yells “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” at a fast-moving car rolling into a New York City crosswalk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c412hqucHKw But in all seriousness, shouting “Hey, I’m Walking Here” was far too representative of our own Los Angeles experience—a place where walking doesn’t get enough respect. We found ourselves becoming inspired by other entertaining yet educational stunts that highlighted pedestrians, like a group of pedestrians that actually moved a car which had stopped in the middle of the crosswalk in Brazil: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=UqhUeDTAyYs Or Peatónito, who takes to the streets in Mexico City as the masked Mexican defender of pedestrians: http://m.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2013/02/if-only-every-city-had-masked-lucha-libre-defender-pedestrians/4804/ We realized we needed the same kind of cultural touchstone for Los Angeles: a movement bringing attention, safety and a bit of fun to walking to help build a healthier, more vibrant Los Angeles Walking is a “magic app” for creating a healthy city. As the most common type of physical activity, walking is an easy and effective way to improve fitness. It reduces body fat and bad cholesterol, cutting the risk of some of the leading causes of death in Los Angeles. Walking extends life—walking 75 minutes per week adds 1.8 years of life; walking 2.5 hours per week adds 7 years of life. Walking regularly also improves mood and reduces fatigue. The benefits of walking reach beyond individual fitness to make communities into healthier places to live, work and play. Walking instead of driving, even for short car trips, decreases air pollution and reduces respiratory and cardiovascular ailments as well as some kinds of cancer. Car crashes are the leading cause of death for Angelenos under the age of 5 and the second-leading cause of death for children and young adults ages 5 to 24. Making the city safer for pedestrians can also make the city more equitable: Most pedestrian deaths in L.A. occur in low-income neighborhoods where many residents do not own cars. But the solution is not simply to get more people walking—it also requires that streets and sidewalks be redesigned to protect pedestrians from roadway traffic, slow down cars and trucks, and keep walkers feeling safe. With these ideas in mind, Los Angeles Walks proposes to launch \"Hey, I'm Walking Here!\" (or in Español, “¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!”)—a campaign which will not only increase pedestrian safety, but also highlight and celebrate walking as a conscious act that’s happening all over the city. And by expanding upon our existing Los Angeles Walks work including awareness, events, community meetings and action, we’ll be able to support long-term efforts to build a more walkable Los Angeles by 2050. Activities funded through our “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” campaign will include: Creating a bilingual “Hey, I’m Walking Here!”/ “¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!” publicity campaign using posters, stickers, public art, infographics and social media. Authoring “Hey, I’m Walking Here!”/ “¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!” materials which will highlight the benefits of walking as a healthy and civic-minded action. Convening community meetings in three neighborhoods where residents will assess the “good, bad and the ugly” for pedestrian activity, highlighting unsafe or unsavory walking environments to improve on the “Hey, I’m Walking Here” action days. Organizing “Hey I’m Walking Here” action days where local communities will be empowered to make temporary, attention-getting improvements to local walking infrastructure (like a Parking Day focused on pedestrians). Designing a pilot program for a pedestrian-focused urban wayfinding system that also serves as a publicity campaign throughout the city, to help Angelenos to understand the distance between neighborhoods and landmarks, and see that more places are walkable. Holding regular group walks to underscore how walking is a fun way to explore the city and promote healthy lifestyles, where we will provide “Hey I’m Walking Here” materials. Promoting pedestrian parades and events during CicLAvias (WalkLAvia) to make sure walkers have a welcoming space when streets are closed to traffic. Educating local residents about how to ask for higher-visibility crosswalks and lower speed limits on their streets (especially near schools).",

    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles has incredible potential to become one of the world’s most walkable cities. Our mild climate is one obvious advantage, providing us with perfect walking weather almost every day of the year. Even our reputation for sprawl works to our advantage: Los Angeles developed as a series of small towns, meaning that there are multiple historic downtowns and commercial corridors that provide interesting places to walk. We also have the fastest-growing transit system in the United States, providing an extensive “walk extender” because it allows people to walk to a bus or train, take transit, then continue walking to destinations. New rail and bus rapid transit stops can evolve into walkable hubs that can allow more Angelenos to reduce driving or live without a car. Just raising the visibility of walking a little bit will have a tremendous impact with multiple co-benefits, and has potential to support a transformation the way the city thinks about walking and travels.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "By 2050, Los Angeles will be known globally as one of the best cities for walking in the world. The biggest change can be easily seen from the air: All of L.A.’s once-famous freeways have been removed, their multiple lanes of traffic replaced with extensive linear parks. Down the center of each of these parks are wide, green boulevards with clean energy rapid buses, protected cycling lanes and excellent walking paths. This network of “urban trails” connects each of L.A.’s neighborhoods so it’s completely possible to get nearly anywhere in the city on dedicated foot or bike infrastructure, although the extensive rail system is usually faster. L.A. City overall health will be significantly improved with most citizens naturally getting in the public health reccomended minimum 10,000 steps a day as they go about their daily living, and collision rates for pedestrians and the city with drastically decrease. Drivers stop, with tender caution for pedestrians as they cross the street. Hit n’ runs are a thing of the past. people take responsibility for their actions and realize that the guilt of running away from the scene of the crime is more harmful to them than owning up to their actions, and individuals will recognize the serious responsibility in their hands while as drivers. 90% of kids walk or bike to school as they attend quality schools close to where they live. Walking Meetings will be a common occurence in the workplace. And streetwalkers will come to take on a whole different meaning in Los Angeles. A remake of “No One Walks in LA,” will be made with the title changed to “We all walk in LA” and mashed up to Randy Newman’s infamous “I Love LA”. Mayor of Los Angeles will champion themselves as “Sidewalk Mayors” and other urban regions will look to Los Angeles with envy and questions for advice for how their neighborhoods can be as awesome as ours.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Many Los Angeles residents already enjoy walking and are instinctively drawn to areas good for walking—places like parks, the beach and walkable commercial districts. But most Angelenos have not taken the next step to consider how their neighborhoods can become more walkable. Los Angeles Walks’ “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” campaign is intended to tap into this latent desire to help Angelenos request more pedestrian amenities, build more vibrant communities, and elevate the act of walking in the City of Los Angeles."

Through a series of 11 workshops, Youth Voices students are exposed to digital and multimedia tools (audio, photography,video), storytelling techniques, creative mapping strategies, and a brief history of collage art and muralism. Students are encouraged to utilize these new skills to become content producers -- researching the people, places and stories of their community to create multimedia stories that will introduce and guide visitors through key locations in their neighborhood. Finally, they learn to employ social networking strategies to promote and share their productions and receive feedback from their peers. The Departures Youth Voices curriculum meets and/or addresses several of the California Common Core Content Standards, as well as build key foundational skills in the new media literacies both of which are essential for students to succeed in the 21st century classroom and in the quickly evolving workforce. The Mobile Classroom will deploy the Departures Youth Voices program at schools, youth organizations and events. Equipped with chairs and tables, cameras, editing equipment, and wifi capabilities, the Mobile Classroom is a fully functioning digital lab (housed inside a converted bus or trailer) that allows students to participate in Youth Voices workshops in a controlled and formal classroom environment, even in the most informal settings such as outdoor community events. This will allow us to provide either the full media literacy curriculum, or a single curated workshop specifically chosen for each location. The Departures Youth Voices Mobile Classroom will extend the reach of Departures Youth Voices to schools and youth organizations that have limited or no technical resources. In addition, it will allow us to reach more educators with our professional development workshops, providing an introduction to media literacy, connected learning, and a step by step training on implementing Youth Voices in their classroom, increasing the sustainability of the program.",

    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In just 37 years we will arrive at 2050. Life, ideas, and technology are moving at quicksilver speed, so we must act fast to ensure that changes are made to the education system and students are encouraged to be active participants in their own education, able to define their own paths to success with the support and resources provided by their schools. Taking a cue from “Literacy in the 21st Century,” greater achievements by students will occur when schools and classrooms are transformed from storehouses of knowledge into gathering places for students and teachers to explore, to question, to experiment, and to discover.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "In 2013 we will cultivate partnerships with schools and organizations in communities along the Los Angeles River and the San Gabriel River, and South L.A.’s Leimert Park. Currently the Youth Voices curriculum is being taught at three high schools in Northeast Los Angeles as part of the community outreach efforts of the Northeast Los Angeles Riverfront Collaborative, a project set to run through 2014.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The Departures Youth Voices Mobile Classroom will be evaluated through surveys, and short and long term assessment markers.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "According to the LA2050 Report, education in Los Angeles is “a significant impediment to human development.” A harsh reality for the almost 2 million students in L.A. County. The facts are abundantly clear that a high percentage of students are not receiving the kind of education that engages and nurtures their interests, or offered the support they need to identify and connect their interests to academic success and career opportunities. This is one reason for the large number of disengaged students and dropouts (i.e. lost students) in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD.)",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "In the past five years Departures Youth Voices has worked with almost 200 students in schools and organizations throughout Southern California. These include the L.A. Leadership Academy in Lincoln Heights in an exploration of the L.A. River; the Environmental Charter High School in Lawndale to uncover the social history of Compton's Richland Farms; Venice High School to examine the myth and reality of Venice; the Chinatown Service Center’s Youth Council to highlight the rich and diverse history of Chinatown, and Franklin High School to share the stories of the people, places and historical events that have shaped Highland Park."

    "summary": "Thank You For Coming is an experimental food and art space in Los Angeles that opened its doors to the public in December 2012. We are a collectively-run and permitted restaurant -- this means that our crew rotates through volunteer and artist residency programs which offer people with varying interests and skills opportunities to cook for the public, play with a space, and experiment accordingly. By presenting these opportunities and their resulting ideas in a permanent and public restaurant space, we are able to provide accessible, unexpected, and participatory cultural experiences for Los Angeles residents. By intentionally operating Thank You For Coming as a place that draws ambiguous lines between art space, community center and food facility, we want to demonstrate that arts and cultural vitality can thrive in everyday spaces and via the endeavors of everyday life -- in our case, as it pertains to the basic acts of eating and feeding and through the universal medium of food. This school of thought can help move Los Angeles towards providing access to arts for all because its low-barrier process invites the populace to create and participate in its own creative experiences, thereby encouraging the proliferation of autonomous cultural production in countless pockets of the city, whether occurring in living rooms, neighborhoods, restaurants, libraries, parks or parking lots. Thank You For Coming was conceived and built on dreams, lots of people power, and a highly-involved collaborative process. We are a rag-tag crew of teachers, builders, scientists, gardeners, activists, and artists, but we are all firm believers that we have the ability to harness our own creativity and bring attention to it through careful resource appropriation and a do-it-together, collaborative approach -- which means that in the process, we are creating our own culture (and sometimes, economy) and building our own community. For as long as we remain open, we are committed to figuring out different ways we can transfer this empowering outlook to as many participants as possible.",

Each is important, and all together, they are integral. Mostly, we remain anonymous and amorphous -- but here, we list as many names as possible to demonstrate how many collaborators have helped realize Thank You For Coming in the short time we’ve been open.

The A Lot Initiative will begin in Fall 2013. A LOT's primary goal is to broaden audience and artist engagement, as well as, expand geographic scope, with underserved communities especially benefiting. Rather than placing cultural activities in enclosed venues for a limited number of people for a couple of hours, the objective is to enliven vacant lots, streets, and entire areas with creative energy -- sound, light, visual art, and performance -- for days or even weeks at a time. In addition to engaging residents in the arts, A LOT is intended to increase pedestrian traffic and enliven streets with vacant storefronts, thus creating prospects for both \"pop-up\" and more permanent businesses to revitalize these neighborhoods.

In addition to the quantitative performance measurements, the Arts Council for Long Beach will work with its primary partner, Long Beach Development Services, to evaluate the qualitative impact of the project on the communities involved. The partners will assess the level of increased social and economic vitality in areas where performances take place, such as reduction of blight; businesses opened in vacant storefronts; new gathering spaces; positive reporting in the media; and increase in membership in neighborhood and block associations. The partners will also work with the community to gather to anecdotal evidence of change, such as increase in neighborhood pride; and greater interaction of cultures and ethnic groups.

It furthers support of cultural participation by creating art opportunities in areas where previously there was limited to no access to the arts. A LOT allows new audiences to experience art in their neighborhood. While the current structure and focus of the initiative is on underserved neighborhoods and residents in the Long Beach area, the project's concepts can be applied throughout the region."

    "summary": "Found LA: Festival of Neighborhoods, October 13, 2013, is a day-long celebration of the people and places of Los Angeles providing FREE opportunities for people to explore little known parts of the city with locals as their guides. Organized and implemented through the work of volunteers from many of the areas to be explored, the project provides rich and varied options for people to interact across the divides that make it difficult for Angelenos to develop trust. In addition to discovering attractions in each of the 40 neighborhoods on offer, an essential component of each experience is sharing a locally prepared meal. Food is the great connector, providing a visceral way to get to know previously unknown neighbors based on the sharing of comfort through a well-prepared meal. Eating together is an invitation to socialize and build relationships as barriers to interaction lower with each delicious bite eaten. Seated in a restaurant, a backyard, a community garden or a church banquet hall, people from very different parts of Los Angeles come together and recognize their connection with others and feel more a part of the city. Harvard scholar, Robert Putnam, writes on the value of “social capital,” or the benefits that derive from the cooperation between individuals and groups including a lessening of social isolation. From “Better Together,” “The arts can nurture social capital by strengthening friendships, helping communities to understand and celebrate their heritage, and providing a safe way to discuss and solve difficult social problems. The arts provide a powerful way to transcend the cultural and demographic boundaries that divide us and to find deeper spiritual connections with those like us.” Found LA 2013 will be the third year of the festival. In 2011, 15 tours were held in neighborhoods across Los Angeles, from West Hollywood to San Pedro, from Santa Monica to Highland Park. Tour guides ranged from LA City Councilmember Eric Garcetti (Atwater Village) to food blogger Namju Cho (Koreatown) to youth organizers from Chuco’s Justice Center (Inglewood/South LA). In Leimert Park, artist Karen Collins shared her African American Museum of Miniatures. The surprising Museum is comprised of shadow boxes created with found objects depicting scenes from the history of the African American community—from the royalty of Egypt to Martin Luther King and Mohammed Ali.

She said, “It was a fantastic opportunity for the temple to open its doors to a non-Korean speaking audience. It's when people come together that ideas become real and understanding deepens. That's very magical and I see that as one of the most important aspect of these neighborhood tours.

    "summary": "Our goal is nothing less than to lay the foundation so we will transform Los Angeles into a world class city and region by 2050, by tackling the biggest obstacle to meeting the housing problems LA2050 lays out.\n\nThe reality is that we cannot solve the region’s housing challenges without first addressing that sibling of land use issues: transportation. An adequate rail transportation system – like most other large cities have -- is the means to an end here for making it politically possible to build the ample, denser housing needed to increase affordability and meet current and future needs. The biggest challenge to building the housing supply that will meet demand and lower costs, and to making areas with affordable housing accessible, is our traffic and lack of adequate mobility options, which causes citizens to block new housing construction.\n\nOur LA2050 project will propose, legitimize, and build a movement for a fully-built out, fast rail transit system in Los Angeles County: fast, ubiquitous subway lines that connect housing, jobs centers, and major destinations; and frequent, expanded commuter rail to connect more affordable housing areas. New York City has it. London has it. Tokyo has it. Paris has it. Chicago has it. Los Angeles doesn’t, and we’ll never be a world class livable city until we do. And we certainly will never be able to meet our housing challenges until we do.\n\nWe won’t just propose a vision; we will legitimize it and build a movement of supporters.\n\nTo do so,. this year we will host an international distinguished speaker series bringing top global thinkers & doers to LA to inject global thinking into the civic conversation in LA, and to speak to the impact that other cities’ fully built-out rail systems have had on livability. Modeled on an expanded version of the Dutch Embassy's 2011 ThinkBikeLA weekend, which resulted in green bike lanes in LA, we will invite speakers of the caliber of Boris Johnson (Mayor of London), Tyler Brûlé (founder of Monocle & Wallpaper, Financial Times columnist, known for Monocle’s Global Quality of Life report), and Bruce Katz (director of Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program). Beyond our own events, we will invite the LA Mayor and other civic elites to host additional receptions, high-level meetings, or workshops to maximize the visitors' influence.\nWe also propose to make infographics & a video to build momentum for our vision and to highlight other cities that have coordinated and met their housing and transportation challenges, to inspire Angelenos that we can do so, too. (We have already have an Emmy/Peabody- award winning documentary producer who wants to do a longer, multi-year documentary project for us (funding permitting); this YouTube video could either be a short 2-3 min. documentary-style video, or an independently produced viral video similar to “Did You Know?” (http://youtu.be/PHmwZ96_Gos).\n\nWe will make presentations on our LA2050 vision -- and how to fund it to make it happen -- to major business, civic, labor, environmental, and land use groups and leaders, signing up endorsers and building a coalition of supporters. We will work through the media to attract signatories from the broader legions of frustrated commuters, and we will do other efforts advancing our mission.\n\nINDICATOR There are three primary reasons that a fully built out rail transportation system impacts the Housing Indicator:\n\n1) despite housing shortage – and the according increase in housing costs, the lack of a fully built out rail system causes traffic gridlock, blocking new housing construction from being approved due to community concerns about traffic impacts of new development. (Our group’s president used to staff the Land Use Committee at a major business group and saw this firsthand.)\n\n2) areas that do have (more-) affordable housing in the suburbs and exurbs lack subways or adequate commuter rail linkages, unlike counterparts in other cities.\n\n3) Angelenos have less money to spend on housing due to high transportation costs. Unlike in other cities, transit often isn’t a practical option. The average Angeleno could save $900 per commuter per month by taking transit and giving up a car (http://bit.ly/XFWdVk), money that could go towards housing expenses.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is best illustrated by this anecdote from a LA Times article by Christopher Hawthorne: \"Ron Galarze, who works in the epicure department at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills ...takes the bus to the store from his home in Whittier, a trip that takes between 90 minutes and 2 1/2 hours each way.\" Housing & transportation issues are intimately linked.\n\nBy building a comprehensive rail transit system, we will be able to remake LA, with dense housing developments along transit lines and near job centers. We can--and must–remake LA into a livable, world class city.",

    "organization": "Sabio Enterprises, Inc.",
    "summary": "Sabio will train unemployed, underemployed and underrepresented individuals from LA, via an accelerated learning program, to enter the technology sector so that they can participate in today's high-tech economy. We will utilize an immersive boot camp environment to create a workforce that sets the standard for entry level technologists. Sabio’s training program will simultaneously serve to cure the current imbalance in the existing technology workforce, which suffers from a largely homogeneous make up. This training can be completed in as little as 3 months. Other areas of the country are having great success in producing employable talent in this same time. With Sabio, LA can have a program of its own. Just 7 years from now there will be 1 Million technology jobs that will go unfilled because we do not have a properly trained workforce. This represents $500 Billion in wages that Sabio will bring to LA by training Los Angelinos to fill these jobs. The Bay Area Council Economic Institute’s Local Jobs Multiplier indicates that for every 1 high-tech job created 4.3 other jobs are created. Therefore, developing and strengthening the area’s high-tech sector will have a significant impact in the local economy by promoting growth. However, we do not have to wait 7 years to start taking advantage of the lucrative salaries in the high-tech sector. In fact, we do not even have wait the years it takes colleges and universities to produce this talent. Sabio graduates can fill the many currently available positions. Sabio’s training staff will be seasoned professionals currently exercising their programming skills. More specifically, they will also have a proven history of successfully mentoring entry level programmers. Our training will be conducted in a format that is best described as a “bootcamp.” This format will approximate the intensive nature of a startup and prepare our trainees for the most rigorous environments. Our official training hours will be conducted 5 days a week and over the course of three to four months. Another key differentiating aspect of the Sabio program is its immersive environment. Our training facility will be co-located with other high-tech startups. Throughout the training program the trainees will be deliberately exposed to real world professionals, allowing them to build their network of contacts and be uniquely prepared to enter the tech workforce. By training unemployed, underemployed, and underrepresented individuals that live in LA, Sabio directly impacts all the metrics noted in the LA2050 Report for employment and income. Many careers in technology have starting salaries that are higher than the median income for individuals. This is more pronounced when comparing the median incomes of Latinos and African Americans. In these cases, an entry level tech salary can match that of an entire household of said group. These salaries allow one working adult to earn approximately 164% of the income need to live comfortably in a household of one. This one adult will also be able to support a family of four within 2-3 years of completing the Sabio training program. This is possible because of the unique advancement opportunities in the high-tech sector that place Sabio trainees on a path to earn $100,000 a year within 5 years of completing the program. Another aspect of the high-tech sector that is important to consider is its extremely low unemployment rate. Varying reports indicate that the unemployment rate for the high-tech sector is between 2% and 4%, which is approximately half the national unemployment rate, and 33% of LA County’s. Building an economy whose job base is concentrated in a sector with low unemployment naturally brings the overall unemployment rate down. The nature of the services we will provide will directly decrease the unemployment and underemployment rates in LA. Our strong focus on the bottom quintile of the wealth distribution graph will have a great impact in the area as we will be serving to raise the lowest end of the spectrum. Sabio graduates will enter the high skilled workforce, move off the unemployment rolls and secure an economically advantageous career. Furthermore, a survey from the Kauffman Foundation found that Latinos and African Americans are highly inclined to start new businesses at a rate of 64% and 63% respectively. Therefore, in empowering our trainees with the technical skills necessary to build and execute on their ideas, we will actually be complimenting their already established desires to start new businesses. The technical training that will be provided by Sabio will allow Latinos, African Americans and women to overcome some of the existing barriers that they face in starting a new business. Facilitating their success in building their own businesses will create a synergistic and positive cyclical affect in creating more technology based, minority owned and minority driven companies that create more high quality jobs in LA",

    "organization": "Prototypes",
    "summary": "Most low-income mothers seeking treatment for addiction, mental illness and domestic abuse face a heartbreaking choice: give up their children to a guardian or foster care and get help, or stay with their families and continue to suffer. Prototypes provides Los Angeles’ most vulnerable women and children access to behavioral healthcare and social services to ensure they can become healthy, independent and productive community members. Prototypes’ LA 2050 project is to ensure the robustness and sustainability of our children’s services. Prototypes’ children’s services are critical to the mother’s success and allow for Prototypes to tackle the intergenerational cycle of addiction, abuse and poverty. Children of addicted parents are the highest risk group to become alcohol and drug abusers, and studies have also shown that children with mothers with mental illness are at increased risk for psychological problems as well as alcohol and drug problems. Of the children who arrive at Prototypes, 56% of them suffer from developmental delays, hyperactivity or difficulties with attachment, and 71% of them have witnessed violence in their home or community. Prototypes was founded to fill the gaps left by traditional social service organizations and has pioneered the way to treat complex issues including homelessness, co-occurring substance use and mental health conditions and trauma by allowing mothers to stay with their children through recovery – and by providing a safe, comfortable environment for women and children to receive treatment for all of these issues in one location. A majority of clients have multiple physical and mental health needs, including chronic diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Therefore, Prototypes’ programs reflect these multiple needs by including rehabilitative, educational and vocational services along with life-skills training. In fact, Prototypes’ programs were the first of their kind to offer wrap-around services within a single location to ensure that women who complete the program are strong, self-sufficient and able to care for and support their children. Pregnant and post-partum women receive specialized support, treatment and access to pre- and post-natal care, and children receive a vast array of services including individual and children’s group therapy, onsite childcare and a Head Start preschool as well as pediatric care to ensure their best start at life. This holistic approach to treatment enables Prototypes to serve extremely high-risk women and children with equally high success rates. One of the most high-risk populations that Prototypes serves is women within the criminal justice system. This work started with the addition of Prototypes’ Community Prisoner Mother Program to provide residential substance abuse treatment services to California State inmates. The Community Prisoner Mother Program, in partnership with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, is truly a unique residential treatment program and provides comprehensive treatment with the goal of preparing inmate mothers and children for successful reintegration into their community. Respecting their important roles as mothers, Prototypes assists in reuniting mothers with their children and preventing separation of mothers and their infants at birth. As Los Angeles looks toward a healthier 2050, today’s children determine the future status of the health indicator. Integrating children into their mother’s treatment, and providing these children with physical and mental health services, reduces their risk of future problems with substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal justice involvement and keeps them out of the child welfare system. Keeping mothers and children together also plays a significant role in helping women maintain a sense of hope and determination as they proceed through treatment. Notably, mothers who receive family-centered treatment have increased rates of post-treatment sobriety. Ultimately, supporting both mother and child together strengthens their bond and ends the intergenerational cycle of addiction, abuse and poverty. Health is a critical component in determining a persons’ overall living condition. Providing critical services to children as early as possible ensures a healthier outcome with reduced risks of physical, mental and emotional health problems, including chronic diseases. And, while Prototypes’ children’s services help improve the health of Los Angeles, they also impact other indicators including education, public safety and income and employment. Preventing future health risks and providing a child a safe home enables them to continue their education, which, in turn, reduces the chances of crime-related activity and keeps them on the path of higher education and employment. While Prototypes’ services aim to address the current health needs of uninsured and vulnerable women, these services also ensure future generations’ health and safety.",

    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Prototypes maintains many partnerships throughout Los Angeles to provide comprehensive services and to reach highly vulnerable individuals. Partnerships with local and state agencies such as the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health and Department of Children and Family Services provide a foundational support for the organization. Prototypes also partners with the Pomona Unified School District to provide Head Start programs and academically enriched after-school programs. Prototypes also collaborates with a federally qualified health clinic to ensure rapid access to primary and pediatric care of its clients, especially those with chronic health issues such as HIV/AIDS, whether or not they are insured.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "When Prototypes first opened its Pomona Women’s Center in 1988, it was the first residential treatment center of its kind to allow women to keep their children with them while they recovered. Since then, Prototypes has rapidly grown to be one of the leading behavioral health care providers of comprehensive treatment for vulnerable families with co-occurring disorders. Prototypes is also one of the largest social service organizations in the United States serving high-risk women and their children. Highlights of Prototypes’ past achievements include:",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Prototypes is often a last stop for women and their children who have immediate needs like access to shelter and food, but also complex mental health and substance use issues. With 11 locations in Los Angeles, and serving 12,000 people annually, Prototypes currently reaches underserved communities as a critical safety net for individuals seeking intensive and individualized treatment. Prototypes works to make sure that health disparities are reduced for the most underserved communities, increasing this population’s overall health and access to care. Additionally, Prototypes has made infrastructure changes in preparation for healthcare reform ensuring that our services continue to reach underserved care as individuals gain access to health insurance.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The success of Prototypes’ programs is dependent on both the well-being of women and children and addresses four objectives. The most immediate is to decrease the use and/or abuse or prescription, alcohol and other harmful drugs. Additionally, Prototypes aims to increase self-sufficiency and parenting skills, improve mental and physical health and decrease recidivism and exposure to crime and violence. Prototypes success is dependent on the mothers being able to find a job, provide housing and a safe environment for their children. Short-term outcomes include: 75% of clients will show increased job skills, 70% will find safe and stable housing and 90% will demonstrate an increase in effective parenting skills.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "The children that Prototypes serves today will be between 40 and 50 years old in 2050 and, due to Prototypes’ intervention, will enjoy better outcomes than their parents because their opportunities were not limited due to addiction, violence or mental illness. Rates of gainful employment and stable housing will be higher, and their overall quality of life will be greater. This group will also have significantly less problems with substance use, mental health and domestic violence, and, since they were able to stay with their mothers, they have continued to build strong bonds within their own family and community. They will also have reduced risk for chronic diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes or cardiac disease due to their own knowledge and ability to seek preventive care. Therefore, their own children will have better health outcomes because of their access to preventive health care services and educational and career opportunities."

    "slug": "2013/arts-restore-la-westwood-an-urban-renewal-project-by-the-hammer-museum",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Hammer Museum",
    "summary": "The Hammer Museum proposes to tap into the thriving Los Angeles creative community as a strategy to revitalize communities and villages throughout the city. Los Angeles faces some significant challenges posed by urban sprawl, lack of a comprehensive public transportation system, and traffic congestion, and as a result, it often feels like a collection of smaller disparate areas. Given the incredible artistic and entrepreneurial output that is now happening in Los Angeles (the most concentrated in the world), there is a real opportunity to infuse the artists, artisans, craftspeople and creative makers of all kinds into neighborhoods as a unique and effective way to help define and energize them. Specifically, the Hammer would use its incredible network of local talent and expertise in arts and culture to curate an artisanal pop-up village in Westwood and offer a long term strategy to turn the neighborhood around permanently. We propose to work with the building owners in the village to provide work and retail space for artists and artisans in greater Los Angeles to sell their wares and artistic output. Westwood has struggled significantly in recent years due to a confusing identity, and lagging commercial real estate market. Even though Westwood Village is highly walkable and convenient, with parking all around, there is a consistently high rate of retail vacancies and turnover of existing businesses. On Westwood Blvd, the main thoroughfare in the Village, and adjacent to the Hammer, 30 of the 78 storefronts are vacant – earning Westwood Village the highest retail vacancy rate in west Los Angeles. We believe this once thriving neighborhood can recover if it approaches its troubles with a strategy that has proved effective over and over again throughout the country—work with the creative community. The Hammer has already had extensive conversations with the key property owners who share our stake in the neighborhood about ways to reinvigorate what should be an energetic and economically healthy community. Our vision is that the Hammer would curate a pop-up village (like a group exhibition) of artists, artisans and makers of all kinds to activate these empty unused spaces with designers of furniture, clothing, ceramics, jewelry and other locally produced goods and crafts. In advance of the holiday season we would offer a place for an eclectic array of object makers to display their work. Artists could also use the spaces as open studios where they could engage with the public and exhibit and sell artwork. Additionally, the Hammer has proposed to the owners of several vacant restaurants that a curated series of emerging chefs be in residence at the various locations during the length of the pop-up village. The Hammer would be the gateway to the village and accordingly would market and promote the pop-up village and would hold anchor events, such as performances, music sets by local DJs, art installations, etc. in our public Courtyard. For the period of the pop-up village, we would make affordable parking available (it is currently only $3.00) and create maps and informational brochures on the participating artists and create tie-in experiences between the Hammer and artist storefronts and events. While this initial pilot idea would be akin to a curated live version of etsy.com, the goal would be to sustain and replicate the idea to revitalize the neighborhood permanently. The Hammer would help facilitate a longer presence of artists as merchants in Westwood Village, working as a facilitator between all stakeholders. We would also seek to serve as a catalyst and replicate this model beyond the grant period in other neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles, contributing to a future for Los Angeles where strong community development is fueled by the arts.",
    "goal": null,
    "projectRanking": "Winner",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Over the past decade plus, the Hammer Museum has transformed itself into one of the most innovative and well-respected arts and cultural institutions in Los Angeles. One important focus of our exhibitions and artist programs is highlighting emerging and under-recognized artists. Last summer we organized L.A.’s first ever biennial exhibition, Made in L.A. 2012, which showcased 60 emerging local artists in four venues across the city. The Hammer is also proud of its 14 year old Hammer Projects exhibition series which features emerging local and international artists in what is often their first solo museum exhibition in the United States. Through our public engagement program, launched in 2010, the Hammer has established itself as a leader in innovation through unique and unexpected artist projects that challenge visitors’ notions of traditional museum experiences. As a cultural center, the Hammer also attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year to our multidisciplinary public programs which take place in our state-of-the-art Billy Wilder Theater and adjacent Courtyard, and which include literary readings, artist performances, film screenings, musical acts, meditation sessions, and scholarly and popular culture presentations. All of the Hammer’s public programs are free to the public and we feel strongly that we could be helpful to both artists and our neighbors if the vitality and sense of community that the Hammer enjoys could spill out into our commercial neighborhood as well.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "So far, the Hammer has laid considerable groundwork to implement this idea in Westwood Village during summer 2013. We have met with the property owners of vacant storefronts in the Village to ensure free or minimal rents, and have had several dialogues with stakeholders and partners at UCLA, including CityLAB, part of the Department of Architecture and Urban Design, and the Center for the Art of Performance.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "In the past 25 years Los Angeles has become a thriving cultural economy with 1 in 8 jobs within the creative sector, and the city has earned a reputation as a premier arts destination. Yet while there is now so much creative energy and talent across Los Angeles, there isn’t a cohesive approach to connect artists to audiences in a way that integrates and revitalizes the existing infrastructure of communities and neighborhoods. And there is no direct artist to consumer opportunity except for occasional festivals and fairs. Temporary or narrowly defined opportunities exist, such as farmers markets, arts festivals and business-sponsored artist commissions, but these lack the type of lasting impact on place that we seek to address. And although Los Angeles has no shortage of shopping opportunities or dedicated areas with a high concentration of retail businesses, it is more difficult to find a place where residents and tourists can access unique, locally or hand-made products on an ongoing basis. This proposed movement of instigating artisanal marketplaces in underutilized communities has the potential for a lasting impact on these neighborhoods, with pop-up markets developing into long-term storefronts featuring L.A. artists and their products.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "We will use qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate this project and use this data to help craft sustainability plans (more permanent artists presence in Westwood Village) as well as replication plans (curating artists projects in other neighborhoods and communities). We will track foot traffic, visitors to artists’ stores and existing businesses in the village, press coverage, sales figures, and Hammer attendance. We will also solicit feedback through our social media channels from visitors and participating artists. One of the goals of this initiative is to further the Hammer’s mission of supporting artists and their careers, and an important measure of success will be how this experience enables artists to engage with new audiences, sell their work, and increase their visibility in the community.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Los Angeles would continue its climb as a leading creative center in the nation, and as a top tourist destination for arts and culture (beyond beach and amusement parks). The local artists community would be nourished, thrive, and enjoy real and meaningful connections with residents of the City. The arts would have an important place in economic revitalization strategies, and urban design and planning would consider the impact and influence of arts and artists as a matter of course. Neighborhoods and communities, such as Westwood Village would become vibrant marketplaces that defy homogenization and regularly feature unique locally-crafted wares, and places where new artists can be discovered. Cultural institutions would consider it part of their mission to investigate and influence their surrounding neighborhoods by connecting their artistic expertise and output with the specific needs and capabilities of the community."

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "RiverLAnding Collective",
    "summary": "This summer we propose to install River Landing, a temporary park that inhabits the concrete channel of the Los Angeles River, making its banks and dry-season waters accessible and universally enjoyable. This park and accessway in Elysian Valley will serve as a precedent for future parks on the 51 miles of river banks, a continuous blank space that is almost as large as New York’s Central Park. The project seeks to address immediate open space shortages and create a platform where the citizens of Los Angeles can develop a relationship with their river and deepen their involvement in the eventual large-scale modification of the river channel. A standard film permit will enable us to install River Landing for a weekend, and we will make a movie about the event to spur community and political support for future, public installations during all the summers until the river banks are permanently improved. River Landing will use a temporary scaffolding system and innovative designs to turn the bank into an accessible and multi-purpose space without threatening the integrity of the channel. Because this intervention is only currently possible as a film shoot, we will cast the local community, river stakeholders, and other interested citizens to be in our film about inhabiting the river in this new and visionary way. Inspired by Parking Day LA, which transforms parking spaces into semi-permanent Parklets, we believe that this project will lay the groundwork for the city and river adjacent neighborhoods to advocate and execute summer-long river-bank parklets all along the Los Angeles River. By building and filming our River Landing we will demonstrate the value and feasibility of these installations. Furthermore, the project introduces a format by which Angelenos will become instrumental in reinventing their river, while also beginning to enjoy it now.* We believe that the L.A. River has the potential to rival the beach and mountains as the premier accessible open-space in L.A. but it needs our voices, vision, and support to help it realize its full potential! What better way than to actually inhabit the river with community-generated designs! *This summer, due to a city pilot program, a portion of the River Channel will actually be legally accessible! However, under the current public trust doctrine agreement you can only enter the channel through limited access points and there will be no amenities.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Pullias Center for Higher Education",
    "summary": "Our primary goal is to increase college attendance throughout the under-served communities of Los Angeles which will have a major impact on improving education in Los Angeles and the state of California. There are thousands of students that attend schools in Los Angeles that are not getting the information they need to help them with the college going process. They have the grades and have taken the required courses but are overwhelmed and confused about the college application process so choose not to attend college or go directly to a community college instead of a four-year institution. Attending a community college is not a bad option but may take students at least 3-4 years to transfer to a four-year college if they ultimately want to receive a Bachelor’s degree. The programs that we offer target first generation, low-income, college-bound seniors from low-performing high schools and assist them with the college-going process. The I AM( Increasing Access via Mentoring) program is a mentoring program that provides assistance with the college choice, college admissions and financial aid processes. The SummerTIME (Tools, Information, Motivation, and Education) program teaches advanced writing and “College Knowledge” (e.g. time management, note-taking, financial literacy) to support participating students' transition to the freshman year. Finally, Collegeology includes games (Application Crunch and Mission: Admission) that teach strategies for navigating the college application process in fun and interactive ways. The first game is a card game, the second is a Facebook Application. In April, we’ll be launching FutureBound, a game targeting middle school students that illustrates the connection between making good decisions in middle school and college/career. We are currently working on a game that fosters financial literacy and knowledge about financial aid options for college. Here’s the challenge: with I AM and SummerTIME, we are limited by resources as to how many students we can serve. With the online games, we need to train teachers and practitioners on how to use the games. The 2050 grant would help us expand the capacity of these programs. We currently work with 11 high schools and serve approximately 300 students but we would like to expand our college-going model so that we can serve a wider student population in Los Angeles. Our programs contain tools that can be replicated on a larger scale so that more students will have the opportunity to be accepted to college and receive a college education. A My LA2050 grant would enable us to train more mentors, implement guidance activities at more schools, expand services offered and ensure college opportunity for a larger number of students.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Currently California ranks 40th among the states in the rate of high school graduates going directly to college. By 2050, we hope to increase college-going rates by 15-20% by working directly with students who are eligible to attend college but lack the information and guidance to do so. Young adults who delay college attendance also delay the economic and social benefits of higher education, benefits that accrue both to the individuals and to the state which contributes to our economy. In addition, research on college completion shows that students who follow the traditional college enrollment pattern of entering college immediately following high school are more likely to graduate from college. California’s population is expected to grow from 37 million to approximately 60 million by 2050. Since our population will dramatically increase by 2050, it is imperative that we have a college-educated population that will contribute to our economy. We understand that it may not be realistic for every student to receive a college degree but it’s important that they are pointed in a direction that offers as many opportunities as possible and that they learn invaluable skills that are required for long-term and sustainable employment. We would like to expand our programs so that we can serve at least 1,000-2,000 students during the academic year.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Our project will help improve the college-going rates at high schools that have the lowest college-going rates within the Los Angeles Unified School District. Many students who are eligible for college choose not to attend college because they receive little support on how to navigate the college-going process or lack the information on how to apply. By pairing mentors with high school seniors who are college-eligible, they can successfully guide them through the college application process. The high school graduation rate in California ranks in the bottom half of all U.S. states, with the Los Angeles Unified School District’s own graduation rate well below the state’s, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Budget cuts have severely affected the amount of college counselors at the schools. A shortage of counselors limits the support that students receive regarding the college application process. Traditionally, California students' access to counselors varies by grade level, and 29 percent of California school districts have no counseling programs at all. The ratio of students per counselor in California averages 945 to 1, compared to the national average of 477 to 1, ranking California last in the nation. In Los Angeles, the average ratio is 800 students to 1 guidance counselor. Many under-resourced schools have guidance counselors, but not dedicated college counselors. Students attending private schools and public schools in affluent parts of the city are afforded very different access to college information and support, often supplemented by parents employing private college counselors to shepherd their children through the complexity of college applications. Thus the gap between those who have access to resources and those who don’t remains stark; the implications for college graduation rates and lifetime earning potential are obvious. By having volunteers serve as mentors, they can alleviate the burden of college counselors having to work with enormous case loads and students can have the one on one interaction needed to understand how to navigate the college admissions and financial aid processes.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "With regards to the effects of the programs on students outcomes, we will measure success by administering surveys to students prior to and post participation in our programs. The surveys will be designed to collect data on the effects of the program on college knowledge and college-going efficacy. We also will conduct selected focus groups with students and practitioners in order to gain a deeper understanding of which practices are working best for students and their teachers and/or counselors.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "The Pullias Center for Higher Education is dedicated to improving access to college for low-income and historically under-represented students. The academic arm of our Center has focused on: (1) researching how students, families and schools define and address challenges related to college going and (2) identifying effective strategies for improving college going outcomes. Our publications are widely used as guides by practitioners across the country. Yet just as significant, our Center has developed a three-pronged outreach approach where we work with schools and students to provide high quality college guidance and support; the three programs we run rank among the Center’s most important achievements to date. The first program we developed – I AM (Increasing Access through Mentoring) provides targeted college guidance support to juniors and seniors in high school as they prepare to apply for college. Many of the students we work with will be the first in their families to attend college. Many also attend high schools with exorbitant counselor to student ratios. I AM mentors work with school based counselors to identify students who might slip through the cracks and then meet with students regularly to make sure the (very complicated) college application process goes smoothly. Once students are accepted to colleges, mentors help students figure out financial aid awards and provide students with support as they decide where to go. We’ve helped over 1,000 students get into college since starting the program in 2005. The SummerTIME (Tool Information Motivation Education) program focuses on college completion. We bring students who have graduated from LAUSD schools and who will be heading to four-year colleges/universities to USC for a month-long intensive writing program. The curriculum is infused with lessons on college knowledge such has how to balance finances, how to interact with professors and how to cultivate effective study skills. The third program provides a twist to traditional college outreach approaches. We decided to meet students where they choose to spend after-school hours – in cyberspace! We partnered with USC’s Game Innovation Lab and students from Foshay Learning Center to create a series of role-playing games about college and careers. Our games were developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles and are now utilized nationally. My LA2050 funding would enable us to expand these programs and train practitioners on how to make use of the game-based tools.",

    "summary": "As an organization that has aided in securing over $10 million in funding for global projects 2) developed more than 600 businesses and nonprofits – boosting employment while implementing services 3) aided in feeding more than 15,000 children and families 4) facilitated free business development workshops for thousands, creating opportunities for business growth, and 5) helped to establish afterschool programs for hundreds of disadvantaged youth; the Kreative Images Foundation (K.I.) is honing our focus to specifically impact South Los Angeles communities through the Collaborative 360 Project. What is Collaboration? 1) The Merriam Webster definition states . . . Collaboration means to cooperate with an agency or instrumentality with which one is not immediately connected 2) Wikipedia’s definition says . . . Collaboration is working together to achieve a goal; working together to realize shared goals; a collective, determination to reach an identical objective; sharing knowledge, learning and building consensus. 3) Dictionary.com explains . . . Collaboration is the act of working with another or others on a joint project, or something created by working jointly with another or others What is Collaborative 360 (C-360)? For Collaborative 360 (C-360), Collaboration means, effectively forming vital relationships with those in South Los Angeles and beyond that will collectively work toward the greater good of others; thereby through joint efforts, C-360 will offer full-circle, wrap-around services to address community needs. C-360 is designed for local businesses, community organizations, churches and residents to cooperatively implement strategies that ultimately create self-sustaining, healthy communities. These joint alliances will produce extensive, long-term outcomes, i.e., reduction in crime, improved community relations, enhanced literacy scores, business creation, and enhanced employment opportunities, just to name a few. Preventing Valuable Economic Leakage by Plugging in the Gaps In order for any community to gain and sustain its most valuable asset (people), there must be services, solutions and economic wealth that exist. Without them, the outflow turns into a steady stream of job reduction, high crime, loss of businesses, etc.; resulting in what’s called white-flight (the departure of whites or wealthier populations). This deficiency of people and resources leaves low-income minority populations to dwell among low-producing schools, sub-standard housing, blighted businesses and more. Stopping the Ripple Effect of Community Deprivation – In order to build healthy sustainable communities, thereby a healthy LA by 2050, it’s important that we uplift and empower “all” Angelinos; while also attracting and retaining the powerful minds and creative individuals that are so much a part of our opulently diverse, cultural lining (USC and UCLA students, visiting tourist contemplating relocation and others); including reigniting the passion and interest of current residents that are contemplating moving away. In order for C-360 to have an impact and promote sustainability communities, we must first understand why people either remain or move from a community. The U.S. Census Bureau announced that among those who moved between 2009 and 2010, more than four out of 10 (16.4 million or 43.7 percent) did so for desirable housing and community related reasons, such as the desire live in cleaner, safer communities. In an effort to create safe, livable communities, C-360 will focus on forming alliances (crossing business sectors, industries and community programs), in our target areas to cross-collaborate and create sustainable strategies for success. We have experienced major success in helping organizations and businesses cross collaborate in ways that are seldom considered before: •\tTeaching strategies to for-profits and nonprofits to collaborate for business sustainability while aiding community residents; i.e., showing a struggling plumber how he can work with a nonprofit job training program (plumbing apprentice program) and provide needed services to low-income families, seniors, the disabled, etc. •\tLinking child care centers with yoga instructors, because studies have shown that toddlers are entering kindergarten with the stress levels of 9th graders •\tHelping mental health professionals form nonprofits to aid individuals that otherwise could not receive their services; with a goal to prevent instances like the senseless killings of Newton, Connecticut; Columbine; the Aurora, CO theater shootings and more.",

So often, these poverty-stricken entrepreneurs are trying to work from home without adequate support, training, and business camaraderie that aids with creativity, improved strategies and more. As recent as this month (March 2013), Best Buy and Yahoo have called back into the office their virtual employees for these same reasons.",

If you have always wanted to get involved, volunteer or help others but didn’t know how – hop on the Do Good Bus!\n\nWe currently host monthly community rides to give Los Angelenos an opportunity to learn about local causes, experience giving back and most importantly, connect with other people in their city. Over the past three years, we’ve visited dozens of causes and connected hundreds of volunteers. In order to expand and give more people in Los Angeles an opportunity to participate – we need to buy a bus. With our own bus, our goals are to: double participation, offer one free ride per month and focus on teaching youth the importance of giving back.\n\nDOUBLE TIME & MAKE IT FREE\nWith our current costs and bus rental availability, we are limited to one community ride per month. These rides require people to purchase a ticket. We believe there’s true value in a Do Good Bus ticket (you even get a gourmet lunch!) but we also know the ticket can be a barrier for some. If we could host one FREE ride per month in addition to a ticketed ride -- viola! -- we’ve doubled the amount of people who can connect and doubled the amount of GOOD we can do.\n\nKIDS AND GIVING BACK\nIn line with the LA2050 report about the direct connection between education and social connectedness, we’ve been working on ideas to engage students via the Do Good Bus. We are committed to teaching our youth the importance of giving back and connecting with their community. In fact, we’ve started hosting FAMILY RIDES to give families access to kid-friendly volunteer activities and teach kids the vocabulary and concepts of giving back. We would love to offer the same experience to students in Los Angeles schools - giving teachers an opportunity to incorporate volunteerism into their curriculums.\n\nThe LA2050 report also suggests education levels are directly related to social connectedness levels. While we don’t have the resources to ensure kids make it to their senior year, we think exposing kids to unique experiences on a Do Good Field Trip, will give them a chance to connect with students across neighborhood lines and with a world outside of the classroom.

    "summary": "Since the inception of the automobile, Los Angeles has been dramatically altered by the increasing amount of asphalt and concrete covering ground surfaces, which absorb incoming solar radiation and reradiate it as heat energy that raises the local air temperature. The higher temperatures increase the formation of smog, heat-related illnesses and the demand for energy as well as decrease the health level of people, plants and wildlife. Exacerbating this trend is the impact of the overall heating of the planet caused by global warming – something has got to give.\n\nWith a population of over 12 million people, the Los Angeles region is a major contributor of ozone and other pollutants that adversely affect climate and temperature as well as air and water quality. As the population continues to grow, the demand for land and services near Los Angeles’ urban center continues to increase, thereby increasing the amount of traffic, concrete and asphalt. The city is expected to reach a population of almost 40 million by 2050 - so the time to approach this problem- increasing heat island effect- is now. This problem is a significant opportunity to create a robust and effective program that addresses the issue in a truly innovative way. The City has already embraced tree planting programs with admirable results however, we propose to address this problem holistically in a two-fold manner – by providing more trees while also mitigating the effects of the asphalt surfaces already in abundance throughout the urban core.\n\nUrban Forest is a pilot program for a nursery on private property, such as a private-sector business, that will provide trees to be planted in public spaces. Built on the idea of partnership, collaboration and exchange, the business (in this case American Apparel) will house the trees on their parking lot, allowing them to grow and be cared for in boxes. The Los Angeles Conservation Corps, a non-profit organization, will lend a hand in maintaining the trees - offering up their expertise to American Apparel to ensure that the trees are properly cared for. When the trees are large enough to be transplanted, they will be picked up by partnering non-profits and government agencies to be planted in public spaces throughout the City.\n\nIn return for space allotment, utilities, operations and maintenance, American Apparel will create a greener, healthier, and more beautifulparking lot that reverses the heat island effect and the City will gain more trees. In addition, Urban Forest also has the potential to be replicated in parking lots across the City - positively impacting even more acreage through the production of more trees at more locations around the City. As an increasing number of businesses join the program, the amount of trees available to be planted in the City will grow exponentially.\n\nThrough this program, as a true multi-benefit solution, several indicators will be addressed, primarily impacting health and environmental quality but also positively affecting the education, income and employment indicators. Initializing a program that not only improves upon existing in-use parking lots, but simultaneously provides trees for the greening of the City, will improve the environmental quality of the City and provide a healthier environment for both the employees of American Apparel and the locations where the trees are eventually planted.\n\nThe program will not only improve the environment, but also provide jobs for local urban youth (through the participation of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps) as well as educate staff and create new jobs at American Apparel. Through the visibility of the parking lot at American Apparel, the trees that are planted throughout the City, and a campaign initiated both online and through signage, awareness will increase about the program and the importance of green space in the City enhancing human development and making Los Angeles a better place to live.",

    "organization": "Child360 (formerly Los Angeles Universal Preschool)",
    "summary": "LAUP will use the LA2050 Education Grant to initiate the first phase of a thorough research study on the impacts and outcomes of quality preschool for a test group of students. These outcomes will demonstrate how investing in early education now will make LA a better place in 2050 by dramatically improving our education system starting from the students up. Science has proven that 90% of a child’s brain development occurs by age five, but less than 4% of public investment in education occurs by that time. LA’s education system is in crisis, with a shameful lack of state funding making a bad situation worse, year after year. California is 47th in the nation in per-pupil expenditure and 49th in class size, with LA driving that statistic as the largest school district in the state. Leading education experts agree we must prioritize our investment in high quality preschool and early education programs to see the highest ROI and societal impact. James Heckman, University of Chicago Economics Professor and Nobel Laureate in Economics, has appeared before Congress with the assertion that “a large body of economic, health and social science data makes it clear that early childhood education is more than a social imperative; it is an economic one that has far reaching implications for our nation.” So if the experts agree, why isn’t anything being done about this crisis? LAUP recently contracted a third party to conduct dozens of focus groups whose findings substantiated the general misunderstanding about the long-term societal and economic benefits of quality preschool among various LA demographic groups. Without this basic understanding of what it really means for our city, state and nation to educate our population early and well, the type of funding that can only come about through voter approval of new legislation is unlikely to occur anytime soon. Therefore, LAUP will use the funds from LA250 to launch a research project of a scope that has not been attempted in Los Angeles to date. The standard for preschool outcomes research, the Perry Preschool Project of 1962, is still used today as the primary reference of early education investigators. Using leading expertise in the field, we will conduct updated research, using modern metrics and assessments that take into consideration the differences in learning environment and societal influences our young learners have today. For the study, LAUP will select a quality preschool in LA using our 5-Star Quality Rating and Improvement System. This rating system is currently being used as the model for a state-wide preschool rating system that is being developed as part of the Federal Race to the Top grant that LAUP was awarded last year. An independent third-party research firm will collect data to determine how a quality preschool experience affects concrete factors such as community improvement, school readiness, future academic achievement, future income, and health. LA2050’s support will fund the first year, or Phase 1 of a recommended three year project which would extend through the end of the subjects’ second grade year. At that time, the students will begin participation in California standardized testing and can be assessed across large groups of their peers. Phase 1 of the project will yield valuable data on the effects of preschool in LA and the students’ kindergarten readiness as compared with their non-preschool, or lower quality preschool peers. This data will be immediately applicable to funders for future research and policy debate. The next three years of the study, would complete a data set for all participating children so that outcomes could be assessed from age 4 through 7. A thorough study, equal to the breadth of the Perry Preschool Project, would follow the subjects into adulthood. Along with these advanced research techniques, LAUP plans to use a new social media aspect to the study. While remaining cognizant of the privacy of all of the participants involved, we will provide a way for students, teachers, and parents to document their experiences in LA’s schools. This incorporates a community aspect to the study, inviting public discourse and attention, inclusivity, and shared responsibility. This interactive documentation provides an ongoing record of the child’s learning and gives value to his or her experiences. This new study will not only elevate LA as a leading innovator in early education research and advocacy, but will gain the public and government support to pressure our legislators into substantially funding early education, starting at a local level, and ultimately informing our state, and national discourse on education reform. We must start by investing in our youngest citizens. It must start with preschool.",

We will have moved from one of the lowest performing and lowest funded school districts in the nation, to one of the top five. All children in LA will have the opportunity to make thriving academic achievements, giving them the freedom and ability to become high-achieving adults. LA will be one of the leading cities in education reform, and our preschools will be models for the rest of the nation. LA will become a desirable destination for young professionals and businesses. A well-educated population will contribute to a general LA culture that places a high value on education at every level as well as an involved community whose activism will not stand for a crisis in education to ever take place again. All of these factors will contribute to an environment wherein both voters and policymakers make funding education at all levels, THE main priority instead of a place where politicians consistently look to make deep cuts.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Since 2005, Los Angeles Universal Preschool (LAUP) has supported the operation and/or development of more than 325 preschools in Los Angeles County, touching the lives of more than 60,000 children through enriching curricula and nurturing environments aimed to best prepare children to succeed in kindergarten and beyond.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "LAUP will work in collaboration with a carefully selected quality preschool provider, based on evaluation by our 5-Star Quality Rating and Improvement System.

Our intention is to serve as a model for other public schools and districts and to significantly increase access to a high-quality education that prepares all students for success in college and life regardless of their background or where they live. Today Alliance operates 21 high-performing public charter middle and high schools, educating 9,500 low-income from Los Angeles’ most underserved neighborhoods. Since our founding, 95% of Alliance graduates have gone to college. Despite our success, Alliance recognizes that we are making the best of an antiquated model. While technology has changed our world profoundly, K-12 public schools remain largely untouched by the technological revolution outside the classroom. Classes are still structured largely on the late 19th century industrial model where students learn to read, write, calculate, and memorize in preparation for a factory-like environment. Learning is largely passive, with one curriculum directed at all students regardless of individual student comprehension and achievement levels. When students reach college, most of their education is facilitated by technology. They are expected to work with technology in a self-directed manner and solve complex problems using a variety of sources and strategies. When they reach the workforce, those expectations only increase. By integrating technology into the Alliance's already successful curriculum, Alliance developed the Blended Learning for Alliance School Transformation (BLAST) model to increase student academic achievement, increase personalization and relevancy in student learning, and provide students with 21st century learning tools. In BLAST classrooms, students receive a laptop and rotate through learning stations in small groups during two-hour blocks for core academic subjects. Learning stations include 1) teacher lead instruction with no more than 16 students at one time 2) individualized, interactive online instruction with content that adapts to and accelerates based on each student’s level of proficiency, and 3) structured, collaborative projects in which students use technology to solve real-world problems. This unique rotational model provides a highly personalized environment that maximizes student time with teachers; empowers students to master content at their own pace; provides real-time data that gives teachers and students immediate feedback and allows students to monitor their own progress; and enables students to delve into projects that stimulate critical thinking. In addition, through distance learning classes, students are able to benefit from lessons with the best teachers within and outside of Alliance’s network, and take online, interactive electives not offered at their home school. BLAST schools use supplemental digital content aligned to state and common core standards, which allows students to fill gaps in past learning, or accelerate ahead of their peers if they are ready. The highly individualized nature of the model assures that no student is left behind and no student is held back. Originally piloted in fall 2010 at two Alliance high schools in South LA and Watts, the BLAST model has grown to serve 3,750 students at four Alliance high schools and three middle schools. Alliance plans to grow and strengthen this program over the next five years, opening all new Alliance schools with the BLAST model. Alliance has created a professional development program to provide teachers and principals the support they need to become highly effective educators in BLAST schools. A Summer Institute provides in-depth training for new BLAST principals and teachers and includes subjects such as the use of instructional technology, lesson planning in the rotational model, and how to use real-time data to strengthen instruction and classroom management. In addition, teachers attend quarterly day-long BLAST teacher trainings and weekly planning meetings where they share best practices and solve problems. Built on the solid foundation of Alliance’s rigorous college-preparatory curriculum, BLAST schools significantly increase student ownership of their education and make learning far more personal, motivating, and relevant to the world in which they live, which will ultimately improve student academic performance, high school graduation rates, and college attendance and completion for thousands of students in Los Angeles.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Alliance College-Ready Public Schools has grown to become the largest charter management organization operating in LAUSD, educating 9,500 low-income students at 21 high-performing public middle and high schools. If Alliance were a stand-alone district, we would be larger than 75% of the school districts in California. Alliance has a consistent and exemplary track record of educating students at high levels. More than 92% of incoming Alliance 9th graders graduate in four years (vs. 65% for LAUSD and 78% for the state). One hundred percent of Alliance graduates pass the A-G college prep courses required by California four-year public universities and more than 95% of our graduates have gone to college. Average daily attendance at Alliance schools is 95%. Alliance schools consistently outperform neighboring schools on California achievement tests and four schools have been named California Distinguished Schools. In the past six years, Alliance-wide California Academic Performance Index (API) scores surpass those of neighborhood schools by nearly 100 points, LASUD by 62 points and the state by 18 points. In 2012, six Alliance high schools were ranked in the top 3% of all high schools nationwide by U.S. News & World Report, and Alliance Gertz-Ressler High School was the only school in LAUSD to be named a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education. By consistently achieving academic success across a network of 21 schools, Alliance proves that quality education does not have to be the exception; it can be the rule.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Alliance will evaluate BLAST using a number of measures and methodology. We measure student academic performance based on the percent of students scoring proficient or advanced on California State Standards Tests (and will continue to do so using the Common Core standards when California transitions to those standards in 2015). We also look at the number of students graduating high school in four years, and attending and graduating from college. Measures of college preparedness include number of students taking and passing AP classes, number of students passing the Cal State University Early Assessment Program, and performance on SAT and ACT college entrance exams. To discern teacher, principal, and student satisfaction and identify areas for needed improvement in BLAST schools, we conduct regular surveys with faculty, students, and families. We also partner with outside evaluators to provide objective third-party feedback on what is working and what needs to improve the BLAST model. Specific key measures of success for each BLAST school are:",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "In 2050, 100% of students in Los Angeles would graduate from high school ready for college or meaningful employment. All students, regardless of their parents’ income or where they live, would have access to high-quality, public neighborhood schools that motivate students to be active learners and engaged participants in their own education. All students would be college eligible, taking and passing necessary classes to attend a four-year public university so that every student had the opportunity to attend college if they wanted to do so (and not have that choice decided for them through low expectations of their schools). Seventy-five percent of students would go to college, and 100% of those would graduate. Teachers in our public schools would be treated as highly esteemed, professional knowledge-workers. They would be recruited from the ranks of our highest-performing college students, provided consistent and relevant training and ongoing professional development, and compensated based on performance and at significantly higher levels. Our public universities would again be the envy of the world and would be growing to meet the demands of the highly-educated students graduating from Los Angeles and California high schools. As a result, Los Angeles would be a national and international hub of economic growth and trade, entrepreneurship, and innovation.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "With just the current BLAST schools, Alliance will provide a high-quality, 21st century college-preparatory education for more than 3,750 low-income students annually in Los Angeles’ most underserved communities. Additionally, Alliance plans to grow the number of new BLAST schools by 10 over the next five years, ultimately educating 9,000 low-income students in Los Angeles annually.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Alliance works with Education Elements, a key business partner in the development and refinement of BLAST and the professional development program for BLAST teachers and school leaders. Alliance also works with online learning vendors to recommend improvement to learning software. Other key partners include the Innosight Institute, NewSchools Venture Fund’s College Achievement Network, the Broad Foundation, Computers for Youth, and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation who will release an in-depth evaluation on one of the early BLAST high schools in fall 2013. Alliance also participates in a Professional Learning Community with blended learning school leaders from other charters and traditional public schools."

Talent, experience, and kindness abound in the City of Angels, and by volunteering just a few hours a week, Angelinos can share this wealth with young people.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Los Angeles students attend some of the most overcrowded schools in the United States. With so many students in their classrooms, teachers are unable to offer the one-on-one time that is crucial for young people. 826LA seeks to give students the individual attention they need to become effective learners, confident leaders, and engaged citizens. 826LA’s project will do this by inspiring over 1,000 citizens to get involved in our community and mentor local students. Even a few hours of volunteer time can have a huge impact on a child: studies show that with 35-40 hours of tutoring, a student can increase his or her reading by an entire grade level!",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Since opening our doors in 2005, 826LA has served more than 30,000 students from across Los Angeles County. Thanks to the hard work of over 3,000 volunteers and countless supporters, 826LA has increased its reach substantially over the past few years. In 2008, 826LA opened a new center in Echo Park. This fall, 826LA moved its Westside operations to Mar Vista. This new Mar Vista center increases 826LA’s capacity significantly, providing 2,625 square-feet of creative space for students as well as better visibility and accessibility for the organization. 826LA will have the capacity to serve 30% more students each day through After-School Tutoring in Mar Vista; to add a series of evening workshops targeted at middle and high school students; and to recruit and train up up to 35 volunteers per week."

The RSG! mission is to increase the state-mandated Fitnessgram scores and promote student fitness, nutrition and a healthy lifetime lifestyle in the 5th, 7th and 9th grade physical education classes which are required to take the Fitnessgram test annually. Each Olympian/Paralympian is matched to a specific school and meets with their students five - six times during the school year to inspire, educate, empower, and motivate them toward a long and healthy life. Like tobacco cessation and seat belt use, this is a long-term problem we are addressing. According to the LA Department of Public Health in 2007, over 440,500 of LAUSD's 5th, 7th and 9th graders were obese (having too much body fat). Obese children have a greater likelihood of developing risk factors associated with chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease which often follow children into adulthood. Some populations are at higher risk: low-income individuals, African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans which reflect the LAUSD student population: 73% Latino, 11% Black/African, 9% White, 4% Asian and 3% American Indian/Native American. In addition to the above health disparities, LAUSD has cut back on physical education (PE) in elementary schools, decreased the number of credentialed PE teachers and increased PE class sizes to 40-50-60 students. RSG! was designed to supplement and operate in existing PE classes for the 5th, 7th and 9th graders with teachers and Olympians providing the encouragement and drive to be knowledgeable about health, fitness and nutrition as important elements toward a long and healthy life.

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Downtown Women's Center",
    "summary": "Women experiencing homelessness face complex, intersecting barriers on their paths to personal stability. Since 1978, the Downtown Women’s Center (DWC) has been empowering women to break the cycles of homelessness and poverty by providing a wide array of services that can be tailored to each woman’s needs. The recent economic downturn has shown an increased demand for income and employment opportunities, and women on Los Angeles’ Skid Row are no exception. DWC, an agency that serves 4,300 homeless and extremely low-income women annually, is meeting that need by expanding our comprehensive Education and Job Readiness Program to serve the complex income and employment needs of homeless, formerly homeless, and extremely low-income women. With over three decades of experience, DWC is uniquely prepared to offer services for the hardest to employ women. Many of the women we serve may never be able to reenter the traditional workforce because of physical disabilities, mental health issues, ageing, or other barriers related to their experience of homelessness. Our programs allow these women to learn practical skills, gain a sense of purpose, and regain self-sustainability and earn income from alternative job opportunities. Our Education and Job Readiness Program is made possible through DWC’s on-site Learning Center, as well as our two MADE by DWC social enterprises, a café and gift shop opened in April 2011, and a resale boutique that opened in November 2012. Both businesses offer hands-on job training opportunities, as well as support the local economy in downtown Los Angeles while inviting community members to engage in ending homelessness through socially conscious shopping. SET to Create In 2013, we are building on the initial successes of our SET to Create product-development program allows participants to gain soft skills by participating in workshops, as they simultaneously gain practical skills in creating handcrafted products to industry standards. The MADE by DWC product line emphasizes sustainable goods and includes organic soaps and candles, jewelry, ornaments, and upcycled picture frames and bound journals. Women who complete an initial certification process are able to earn supplemental income, as DWC purchases their items for resale in our two stores. SET to Work With the recent opening of our second social enterprise, a resale boutique, we are able to offer even more hands-on job-training opportunities. This year, we are piloting an intensive 12-week job-readiness training program through both stores, which we will expand as we grow our businesses and community partners. SET to Work participants will develop marketable skills including inventory management, customer service, food handling, and administrative tasks. Each woman will receive one-on-one case management to set goals and address housing, sustenance, and health-related needs. Program graduates will then be connected to employment opportunities, including exclusive externships and entry-level positions designated by our growing network of corporate partners. 2013 Impact Our Education and Job Readiness Program will impact LA2050’s Income and Employment indicator by improving literacy, job readiness, employment, and employment retention among homeless and low-income women on downtown Los Angeles’ Skid Row. This year, DWC plans to engage 925 women in services through our Learning Center; launching SET to Work and scaling up our SET to Create workshops will allow us to provide paths out of homelessness and poverty for more women. Our Holistic Approach DWC’s services and programs have been developed with an understanding that the women we serve continue to experience the barriers, trauma, and daily hardships correlated with homelessness and poverty. DWC is committed to meeting each woman’s needs and to providing a safe haven where women can access the resources they need to remove these barriers. All program participants have access to DWC’s full spectrum of supportive services, offered through our Day Center on Skid Row. Along with basic needs such as showers, meals, and clothing, DWC provides individualized counseling and case management; a Learning Center offering a variety of courses and computer access; an on-site health clinic offering extensive medical and mental health services; and referrals to housing and local community resources. All programs are also open to residents who live in our 119 units of permanent supportive housing.",

When the Center first opened in 1978, it was the first and only resource for women living on Los Angeles’ Skid Row.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Our social enterprise partners include corporations, small businesses, and other agencies who have provided support for our Education and Job Readiness Program through cash and in-kind donations and pro bono consultation, as well as by carrying our product line. These partners include Bloomingdale’s; Hudson News; the Skirball Center; Munger, Tolles, & Olson; Yahoo!; Groundwork Coffee; and Chrysalis.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "DWC measures both the total number of women accessing each of our services and the progress of individual participants. These numbers are audited on a monthly basis and used to determine our overall social impact.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "DWC’s mission is to provide permanent supportive housing and a safe and healthy community fostering dignity, respect, and personal stability, and to advocate ending homelessness for women. Los Angeles is currently the homeless capital of the United States; the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency’s 2011 count found more than 50,000 homeless individuals in LA County, with a high concentration of those individuals on Skid Row. One-third of these homeless individuals are adult women.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "DWC’s vision of success in 2050 is an end to homelessness through innovation and cross-functional services. While our grant proposal specifically addresses the Income and Employment indicator, we recognize that the causes and effects of homelessness reach across several of the indicators outlined in the LA2050 report. Our Education and Job Readiness Program is just one of the ways in which the Downtown Women’s Center provides a pathway out of homelessness; our holistic approach is focused on removing multiple intersecting barriers that women in homelessness and extreme poverty may face."

    "summary": "The RADAR L.A. Festival of Contemporary Theater brings some of the worlds most influential theater companies to downtown L.A., and invests in the future vitality of L.A.’s performing arts community with a unique residency program that creates infrastructure for L.A. ensembles to create their best work and put it in the global spotlight. REDCAT and CalArts, with a consortium of public and private partners, will contribute to the cultural vitality of L.A.’s evolving downtown, and create crucial infrastructure for local performing artists to create new work, with a two-part proposal: - To produce RADAR L.A. 2013, a major international festival of contemporary theater that activates varied downtown L.A. locations with adventurous performances by influential artists from L.A., Latin America, and the Pacific Rim, September 23 to October 6, 2013, and - To organize a series of extended artist residencies and related public events that expands the neighborhood impact of the festival’s artistic initiatives and allows diverse artists to create new contemporary performances, while also increasing their vital role in the planning process for revitalization of downtown L.A.. The festival and residency programs build on momentum from the inaugural 2011 RADAR L.A., which featured 90 performances of 15 productions, engaging over 200 artists. Over 11,000 diverse patrons wandered between ten locations, experiencing affordable theatrical presentations, site-specific events, social gatherings and symposia. The L.A. Times said the “revitalizing” festival fulfilled a “vision of downtown as a vibrant cultural nexus…a resounding success.” By expanding RADAR L.A. with increased artist commissions and residencies, artists receive a strategic investment that addresses the L.A. 2050 report’s call for policies that nurture the L.A. arts community so it can thrive. The experienced curatorial team’s provocative program includes: -Innovative artists who stretch the boundaries of traditional theater; -Community-based projects exploring urgent social justice issues that engage the voices of often overlooked residents; -Cultural influences that reflect L.A.’s demographics, presenting artists from Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Japan, and Indonesia; -Interdisciplinary collaborations merging dance, theater, music and new media. The L.A. Times captured the essence of the first festival’s vibrancy, calling it “an invaluable addition to the city’s cultural ecology,” and stressing its impact on the neighborhood: “Because L.A.’s geography is so sprawling, that sense of urban density is hard to achieve. This is why a festival such as RADAR L.A.…situated within an easily commutable area, can be so revitalizing…I scurried from one theater to the next, bumping into acquaintances old and new along the way…”. The strategy behind the RADAR L.A. Festival is both local and global, recognizing that helping to create work is only one part of the solution—the plan must also include engaging the larger national/international field so that the impact is greatly enhanced, leading to vastly increased opportunities for artists and a significant shift in the perception of Los Angeles as a vital center for contemporary theater and dance. This strategy is proven and effective: as a result of the 2011 RADAR L.A. Festival, six of the eight L.A. productions toured as a result of the exposure.",

    "summary": "Hive Lighting proposes to install new state of the art lighting at an existing field or recreation center (soccer, baseball, playground, basketball, etc.) in the City of Los Angeles. This installation will greatly add to the safety and utilization of an existing neighborhood park. This new lighting will also allow communities, largely with no access to clean technology, the ability to participate and learn about the importance of environmental quality and human impact. Hive aims to improve the quality of lighting in the park, and make it cost effective to keep the park open longer, allowing for greater and more varied use by the community. Hive’s focus is to improve a park in an under-served, low income neighborhood, with a disproportionate incidence of violent crimes, where better lighting, more park access and increased after school activities can make a significant difference in the public safety of the community. We are especially interested in working with a park in the Summer Light Nights program in the City of Los Angeles. We will work with local partners like area churches, schools, neighborhood associations, and the business community to identify the park where Hive will install lights. “Angelenos who feel that they can work with family, friends, and neighbors to bring about positive, collective change are also more likely to report feeling safer.” (LA2050 Report page 34) Saving Costs, Means Saving Parks and Saving Lives: Hive’s lights use 50% of the power of the current lighting being used in parks, our bulbs last 10X longer than existing bulbs and they provide a higher quality of light that looks more like natural daylight. Los Angeles parks are feeling the budget tightening that has resulted from the economic downturn. Los Angeles already has some of the worst park access of any major US city. With only 33% of children in the city living within a quarter mile of a park, Los Angeles can’t afford to lose any of its parks or access hours. The City of Los Angeles already knows this and at great expense has run a very successful anti-gang program called Summer Night Lights to provide park access and activities during the hours associated with peak gang related activities. The program has seen a 57% reduction in gang homicides in participating areas. To prevent parks from having to close and operate with reduced hours, the City of LA needs all the costs savings it can find. Hive’s plasma lights will decrease the electrical bill for the park by 50%. Hive’s lights will also require bulb replacements roughly every 7 – 12 years as opposed to current lighting that often require replacement yearly. This means that maintenance, labor and electrical costs can be significantly reduced allowing for resources to be shifted to other park needs. Hive’s project will help expand the parks system as part of Los Angeles’ ongoing 50 Parks Initiative and increase hours of operation so that existing parks can serve even more of the community. Quality of Light Affects Safety: Hive’s plasma lighting is designed to be a solar simulator; this means that the new lighting will more closely match daylight. It may seem intuitive but more crime takes place in the dark at night. A 2012 Stanford study found that “results provide suggestive evidence that, by increasing ambient lighting, regions may be able to decrease street crime” and “robbery, and violent street crime, decreases by approximately 51%... in the hour where the amount of light increases.” Fields lit with Hive lights will feel more like real daylight and will have a positive effect on the behavior of the individuals in the park after sunset, and increase the community’s sense of security. More Activities Mean Less Crime: Adding Hive’s plasma lighting to a park means that LA can take advantage of Los Angeles’ climate to provide year-round outdoor activities to our communities. This is especially true in the hours after school and in the evening when increased park access can have the greatest effect on young people in the community. A 2004 study of California’s after school programs “in 12 high-risk California communities found that, compared to when they started the program, crime and delinquency-related behavior among participants declined significantly after students completed the program. Vandalism and stealing dropped by two-thirds, violent acts and carrying a concealed weapon fell by more than half, and arrests and being picked up by the police were cut in half.” If the hours of operation for parks and community centers can be increased with lights that are less expensive, park access and park activities can be increased. This will give more of our young people the opportunity to get involved in positive after school activities, and will decrease gang involvement, drug and alcohol abuse and the criminal activities associated with both.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Success for Hive and for the project will be measured objectively.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Our goal with this project is to inspire the use of energy efficient lighting to improve park access and park quality throughout the City of Los Angeles. The result will be safer communities and safer public spaces. Making parks brighter and less expensive to operate allows for increased usage by the communities that are adjacent to the parks during traditionally peak crime hours. This also allows the parks to be used for further after school activities, which will help youth in underserved communities avoid gangs, drugs and the criminal behavior associated with both. Los Angeles is in desperate need of more public spaces for its youth to exercise and gather in safely, and our lights make that possible.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success in 2050 is a vibrant and safe public park system in Los Angeles, lit with low energy, high quality lighting. Angelenos of all income levels will have access to parks and recreational activities they will have an increased sense of community because LA will have safe outdoor gathering areas for exercise, organized sports and events. Having safe well-lit epicenters throughout Los Angeles in 2050 will reduce violent crime, property crime, and gang activity, as well as increase economic and health opportunities in communities that until now were unsafe at night. By 2050, LA will have a bright, beautiful and vibrant park system and as a result, less crime and safer communities.",

What he learned of course, is that the rising levels of CO2 are the primary cause of global warming. As a side note, when Al Gore was an undergraduate at Harvard, it was Dr. Keeling’s Curve that inspired his interest in the environment, which of course culminated in the academy award winning film An Inconvenient Truth. Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, the senior scientist as NRDC, said the following in an interview with the New York Times in October 2012: “We are dealing with a gigantic problem and there is no one large undertaking that any individual or business or country can do to solve our ecological problems. It will take billions of people making highly intelligent choices.” So how do you get billions of people to make highly intelligent choices? By educating them; first hundreds, then thousands, than hundreds of thousands, then millions, and eventually those millions add up to billions. The power of live theater, done well, can be transformative. When I attended a performance of Dr. Keeling’s Curve at The Blank Theater, I knew Sustainable Works needed to bring this play to as wide an audience in Los Angeles as possible.

    "organization": "String Theory Productions",
    "summary": "The LA Giant Harp Public Arts Partnership is a performance and public workshop residency that brings free music, dance, and arts education to underserved communities. The 2050 Fund will enable the partnership of String Theory and Artists for Literacy to launch this project together in 2013. It will transform Los Angeles public space and architecture into sonic sculptures while celebrating the culture and diversity of this great city. String Theory is an established LA-based performance group. We design and build giant Harps that transform architecture into beautiful large scale instruments, which are visually and sonically spectacular. The LA Giant Harp Public Arts Partnership is an expansion of our regular 10-year programming. In partnership with Artists for Literacy, this project is designed to embolden people’s perspectives on where art lives, who owns it, and its powerful role in LA society now and in the future. It will foster a deeply needed connection between audience members, artists, and the communities in which we all live. We have chosen 3 locations in LA for our residency programs. Each residency has 3 components: a grassroots advocacy and outreach campaign that celebrates the arrival of our project and ensures that it’s no secret and everyone feels free to participate; free arts education workshops open to people of all ages and abilities (these yield works of art that are then integrated into the performance); site-specific performances that integrate music, giant harps, dance, and audience engagement – all in non-traditional spaces with free access. The criteria used for choosing each of the 3 locations is based the area’s need for public art and arts education, and the area’s architecture, specifically having historically significant structures that are currently under-appreciated. The locations will be vetted by our advisory board, a board that draws from a unique blend of Los Angeles stakeholders including the Director, Government and Public Affairs of American Institute of Architects, LA Chapter, and a professor of Urban Planning at UCLA. These advisors will ensure that the buildings in our locations are deeply considered for their cultural and historical significance. Here’s a more specific breakdown:` Outreach and Advocacy: Artists for Literacy is non-profit org that has leveraged the power of music and dance to marshal diverse audiences around a common issue since 2000. The artistry of String Theory Productions enables us to create a forum for dynamic exchange around the connection between physical movement and personal well-being, and provide written and experiential learning tools that bring home memorable and meaningful connections between the place, the art, the audience and the issue. We have a commitment to make art and information accessible to people of all abilities and learning styles. Community Workshops: We have run these workshops over the past 10 years all around Los Angeles. They embrace people of all ages and abilities. These Art Circle workshops encourage people to draw, move and listen. The workshop is highly adaptable to all communities. Their performance pieces then become integrated in to the larger String Theory show. We design these workshops to make a tangible connection between the community, the space and the artists. By weaving parts of their story into ours, we break down the '4th wall' of communication between art and the audience. This fosters a profound inclusion that, when experienced by participants, can lead to a shift in their perceptions of where art fits into their lives. Interactive Performances: String Theory is known for our signature giant Harp installations combined with music and dance. We have performed all over LA, including Ford Amphitheater, The Van Nuys Bus Terminal, TED, The Broad Stage, The Getty Museum, MOCA, and The Grammy’s, By utilizing our signature large scale sonic sculpture, String Theory transforms space into giant interactive instruments which become the landscape in which our performances unfold. The creative work inspired by the Community Workshop participants is integrated into String Theory’s performance -- including the participants themselves. The impact this project will have on the Arts & Culture indicator can be qualified through the cultural invigoration of specific communities that have had limited access to the arts, the celebration of culturally diverse communities coming together around art, the experience of art in unconventional spaces, increased awareness of the architecture of Los Angeles as it is a focal point in the Giant Harp installation and performance, increased health awareness as it relates to movement and dance, social connectedness (via our flash drive give-aways at the end of each performance that encourage a deeper look into their own community, the Giant Harp program and its participants), and free arts education from all three components of the project.",

The only sane way to see into the future is to look through a lens of optimism. Any other perspective corrodes any sense of present day purpose. So to us, arts and culture in 2050 inform government policy, education, innovation, and urban planning.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "The Giant Harp Project is extremely unique. It celebrates the temporal transformation of Los Angeles architecture, along with providing world class entertainment for free. This project makes arts education accessible to all through workshops designed to engage multiple communities regardless of their age and physical or mental abilities. Because String Theory has been celebrated by the finest venues of LA, the city has already embraced the phenomena of the Giant Harp. However, it has not been accessible to people without the means to buy tickets to the shows. Artists for Literacy and String Theory are excited to partner with Los Angeles in pioneering the effort to bridge the gap between artists and audience. Without compromising artistic integrity, The Giant Harp Project, believes that the integration of work created by the public (via our workshops) can fortify the actual performance of String Theory and honor the collaborative potential between artist and audience. At its core, this process is about engagement and discovery by both the artists and audiences at a profound level."

Since HOLA first opened its doors 24 years ago, thousands of elementary, middle and high school students have received superior academic support and enrichment activities that provide them with the tools they need to succeed. What began as a sanctuary from the streets for just a few kids is now a thriving 24,000 square foot campus serving 2,500 community youth each year. In HOLA’s Visual Arts program, over 250 students participate in 33 different visual arts classes each quarter, following a multi-level class structure that builds and advances with each successive session. This format allows young artists to progress in their skills and to build strong and lasting mentor/student relationships with their instructors. HOLA offers free classes in over 16 different art forms including ceramics, painting, drawing, screen printing, car design, printmaking, photography, architecture and fashion design. To broaden students’ appreciation for the arts, throughout the year staff engages youth in cultural field trips to museums, art institutes, private art collections, art studios and cultural landmarks, as well as curating four art shows a year featuring student work. HOLA’s Visual Arts continues to develop innovative programming that ever more deeply engages youth to explore and give back to their community. At the core of this goal is the Public Art Project, now embarking on its second year. The Public Art Project engages youth and the community through classes, workshops, artist talks, field trips and public installations in and around HOLA’s neighborhood. Each year, HOLA hires new artists or a collective to implement a public art-themed project during their residency. HOLA utilizes public art as a vehicle to connect established and emerging local artists to the Rampart and Westlake community and to collaborate with its members and LA organizations, using this culturally rich and diverse neighborhood as a canvas to create art. HOLA is located next to the prominent MacArthur Park, and has inspired dialogue in the park by designing creative and unique art installations. In its first year, artists Pearl C. Hsiung and Anna Sew Hoy collaborated with youth on We Are Talking Pyramids, a multimedia, multi-venue public art project drawing inspiration from the park and the personal histories and everyday experiences of the students. The Public Art Project exposes students to myriad art forms, engages guest artists throughout the year and encourages its students to draw inspiration through self-reflection and engagement in their environment, but reaches even beyond the experiences of HOLA’s students and artists. We Are Talking Pyramids culminated in a day of art and performance in conjunction with the LevittLA 50 Free Concerts at the Levitt Pavillion stage and various sites throughout MacArthur Park. The goals were to involve, activate and inspire local families and the community and to create new art in dialogue with the pre-existing public sculptures and murals in the park. Over 2,000 people were in attendance for the event, an incredible starting point for the nascent Public Art Project. The Visual Arts program is only one of HOLA’s nine innovative, structured and rigorous programs. HOLA’s elementary, middle school and high school programs are led by highly trained, credentialed teachers and supplemented with a wide variety of enrichment activities that include visual arts classes, a full youth orchestra and choir, private and group music lessons, premiere soccer and basketball leagues, leadership, language and culture classes. HOLA is committed to providing wrap-around services for all of its youth, from targeted homework help to counseling and family services. To promote mental health, strong families, academic achievement and emotional development, HOLA provides its most at-risk students and their families with exceptional intervention and counseling services and resources. HOLA also employs a Parent and Community Resource Director who works to support effective communication with parents and to promote parent involvement in all of HOLA’s youth development programs. HOLA’s Visual Arts program is a key component of a holistic approach to after-school enrichment. Its students receive not only a substantive arts education, but comprehensive support that helps them change their life trajectory and attain a pathway out of poverty. It is critical that HOLA continue to expand its programs and provide as many at-risk Los Angeles youth as possible with hope for a better life, a community that believes in them and a place they can call home.",

Latinos comprise the largest ethnic group in the community at 63% followed by Asian Americans at 26%. Of the families that HOLA serves, 90% are living at or below the poverty line and struggle each day to simply survive. As a result of these poverty levels and the dense and diverse population, this district is home to heavy violence, drug trafficking and over 30 active gangs that begin recruiting youth as young as 10 years of age. According to a LA Times report, during a recent 6-month period, 488 violent crimes were reported in HOLA’s neighborhood alone.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Great Leap, Inc.",
    "summary": "Overview: Los Angeles is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world, but cross-cultural interaction is often hindered by injustice, misconceptions, fear and competition for resources. Can a musical dialogue open cultural borders between diverse Angeleno communities? Can ritual circle dance help us imagine a new vision for Los Angeles? The LA2050 study indicates that Arts and Cultural Vitality significantly enhance the quality of life in Los Angeles. GREAT LEAP is creating the Fandango-Obon Project as a fresh way to boost this potential. This collaboration between the Grammy-winning artists of QUETZAL, and Nobuko Miyamoto will co-create an original composition that brings together two thriving Latin and Asian music and dance traditions – Fandango son Jarocho and Obon. A series of cross-cultural workshops throughout Los Angeles will teach the song and communal dance, and guide a creative process to share traditions and personal stories to deepen understanding between participants. On November 2nd, Day of the Dead, a culminating Fandango-Obon celebration will bring together diverse community members, musicians and dancers in a ritual piece at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center Plaza. A documentary short video will be created from the process and spread through social media to engage the widest audience. We hope to secure a broadcast television outlet for the video as well. Our goal with this project is to inspire other communities to replicate this model, with meaningful, in-depth cultural exchanges that we believe will create a more harmonious, sustainable Los Angeles of the future. A Dialogue Between Cultures: Fandango Son Jarocho is a popular folk form of music and dance rooted in Indigenous, African, and Spanish cultures from Veracruz, Mexico. Musicians playing ‘jaranas’ (small 8-string guitars) in a circle, others singing and dancing percussively upon the wooden platform, generate a spirit of “convivencia” - living/being together, building communication and trust. Quetzal Flores and Martha Gonzalez of “Quetzal” brought what they learned from Veracruz and are strengthening a network of Fandango Groups spreading throughout L. A. and the nation. Obon is an ancient folk music and dance from the Japanese Buddhist tradition, brought here over 100 years ago. The music commonly uses shamisen, a stringed instrument, taiko and voices also performed on a raised platform. Japanese communities dance the circle at summertime Obon festivals to remember their ancestors. Nobuko has been instrumental in translating this traditional form into a vibrant contemporary practice by creating new songs in English. Over 10,000 people danced her popular environmental-themed piece, “Mottainai (Don’t Waste Nature)” at 16 temples during 2011-12. This new collaboration between Nobuko and Quetzal will spark a groundbreaking “musical dialogue” between cultures. The new piece themed, “All Things Connected,” will give space to each form to express its traditional uniqueness, while exploring new improvisational and harmonic possibilities. Choreography from both traditions will be taught by seasoned dancers, however will be fundamental and familiar enough that people of all ages and abilities can learn, enjoy and interpret freely. The Community Workshops: Fandango Son Jarocho and Obon are proven models for community building. In the neighborhoods of Boyle Heights, Little Tokyo and South L.A., Great Leap will offer a series of workshops to teach the music and dance in community centers, temples, and schools to gather participants for the culminating performance/celebration. Hands-on experience with instruments like the Jarana and taiko, and improvisational exchanges with musicians will bridge the public’s connection to these folk forms. Most importantly, we will provide a space and process for sharing personal stories and cultural traditions that will deepen knowledge of each other. The Performance/Celebration: The finale premieres the new Quetzal/Nobuko piece that will engage at least 500 people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds at the plaza of the JACCC. In a ritual of connectedness there will be performances of Son Jarocho, Obon and Taiko communities, and stories about their cultural significance. Documentation and Replication: Videomaking and distribution through social media will extend our journey of creative exchange and engage the general public. Our documentary will dramatize how participants reflect on and are changed by their experiences, and how the knowledge of our interdisciplinary practices can be continued by a new group of artist leaders. As L. A. lags behind comparable metropolitan cities in per capita expenditures on arts and culture, a project like Fandango-Obon, developed at the grassroots and made inclusive and accessible to underserved communities, is vitally important. Our hope is to inspire many bold, innovative cross-cultural collaborations L.A.’s future.",

We are the “official” administrator for the arts and cultural sector of the Los Angeles Green Business Certification Program alongside the Los Angeles Community College District, the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation, and the Los Angeles Visitors and Tourism Board. AEP promotes and works with arts and cultural organizations to integrate comprehensive environmental sustainability into their operations through a certification process. AEP and its partners form a powerful network of arts and arts support organizations committed to finding solutions to the serious environmental challenges that face our communities, our city and our world. The AEP certification process looks at 8 different areas of operations; • Operations and Culture • General Practices • Solid Waste • Water Efficiency and Urban Runoff • Energy Efficiency • Chemical Use and Pollution Prevention • Transportation • Landscape As the message spreads about climate change and the real dangers associated with it we realize that now is the time to make concrete changes that will create real results. AEP is uniquely qualified to lead this effort with experts that have been trained and have a history of working with the arts and sustainability. The sector has largely been ignored to this point and there are large opportunities to empower these facilities to make a difference and expand their mission as a cultural facility to include the environment. No longer will they just be a theater or a gallery. They are a theater or a gallery with a purpose and mission that includes being part of the solution and contributing positively to solutions to mitigate climate change through emissions, waste reduction, and purchasing policies. AEP is not about waiting for others, we are leading, in action and making it happen. “According to the US Census report of 2007 there are 124,624 active cultural and recreational facilities in the US.” This includes for profit and non-profit. Arts and culture provide a unique connection to the general public that other commercial businesses cannot replicate. The mission of a cultural facility is to draw audience from all walks of life and as a result, they reach the broadest diversity of individuals within a community.

    "summary": "Million Trees LA (MTLA) is a citywide initiative launched in September 2006 by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa. MTLA is a collaborative effort of the City of Los Angeles, community groups, businesses and individuals, working together to plant and provide long-term stewardship of LA’s urban forest. Trees provide shade and save on energy costs, clean the air and help reduce green house gases that cause global warming, capture polluted urban runoff, improve water quality and add beauty to our neighborhoods. Million Trees LA would like to have a series of fruit tree adoptions with a focus on food deserts and deliver fruit trees to people who live or own property within the City of Los Angeles. A fruit tree adoption is where tress are available for free to be planted on residential properties and people are provided information on to plant and care for trees. People adopt a tree and pledge to plant it on their private property. In addition to the environmental benefits of fruit trees, such as improving air quality, fruit trees give people access to healthy food that they grow. It is important for everyone to have access to healthy food options, such as fruit. People’s geographic area should not prevent them from having fresh, healthy food. By providing fruit trees in the City of Los Angeles, including food deserts, we are giving people the opportunity to improve their health and help the environment. Giving away fruit trees either at fruit trees adoptions or by delivering the fruit trees to residential properties for planting, gives people access to fresh, healthy foods while planting a tree that will reduce greenhouse gases, help them save energy by providing shade and capture storm water to replenish groundwater tables. Locally grown food also reduces any pollution emitted by the transportation of fruit from far away places. This will also provide people with the ability to add green space where they live. There are also social benefits provided by trees. More than 8% of children in Los Angeles-217,000- suffer from asthma. Studies have shown that an increase in tree-lined streets could lower that number by 25%. Research presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Conference in Chicago showed that the presence of trees could cut crime by as much as 7%. Specific Activities: (1)\tMTLA will work with our partners to coordinate and host a series of fruit tree adoptions and to manage the delivery of the fruit trees to private property located in the City of Los Angeles (2)\tMTLA will work with our partners and community organizations to conduct community outreach and inform people of the availability of the free fruit trees. (3)\tMTLA will conduct outreach to community organizations and businesses to secure sites to do the fruit tree adoptions, focusing on food deserts. (4) Door to door canvassing before the fruit tree adoption will take place in the geographic area around the fruit tree adoption site. (5)\tOur goal is to adopt or deliver to homes 1000 (5 gallon) fruit trees. (6)\tIn order to adopt 1000 fruit trees we will need to have 5 fruit tree adoptions. The adoptions would take place during the June 2013-December 2013 grant period. (7)\t5 gallon fruit trees will made available for MTLA’s Residential Tree Program, so residents of the City of Los Angeles can obtain free fruit trees to be planted on their private property. The tree will be delivered to them with the instructions and the materials needed to plant the tree. Million Trees LA is currently able to deliver free shade trees to people who live or own property in the City of Los Angeles through our Residential Tree Program. With the support of this grant we can expand the Residential Tree Program to include fruit trees and have fruit tree adoptions focused in food deserts in the City of Los Angeles.

LA Kids Rock! will be completely free of charge for the more than 1.2 million elementary school children in the Greater Los Angeles Area (Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and Ventura counties). We expect more than 100,000 children will take part. LA Kids Rock! will be based on two fundamental premises: 1)\tChildren do best when learning is fun. 2)\tPositive affirmation is essential. We will use a specially customized version of the Skoolbo eLearning platform. Skoolbo is the largest ever educational game and since its launch in June 2012, has been attracting both rapid growth and extremely high levels of improvement in reading and math. How will LA Kids Rock! work? •\tLAKidsRock! will be multi-platform and can be played on the web browser or as a downloadable app (iOS, Android, Windows 8). •\tChildren will play fun reading and math games anywhere, anytime. •\tEvery child will receive a personalized learning program based on individual needs. •\tChildren will be encouraged to connect with their parents, grandparents and teachers. •\tLAKidsRock! will be fully compliant with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). How will LA Kids Rock! mobilize the entire LA community? •\tThroughout the two months we will have a total of 12 special live events at various venues around Los Angeles. These live events will complement the online event and will help take LA Kids Rock! to the whole community. The live events will involve local school children playing learning games with community leaders. •\tIn addition to the live events, we will convert an old school bus into a mobile learning lab. This bus will be equipped with study desks and tablets. The bus will visit more than 100 schools, shopping malls and community centers over the two months. •\tParents and Grandparents will share the experience. They will see their child’s results and be able to play with him or her. •\tWe will work closely with teachers and help support them in their vital role. There will be a sub-section called LA Teachers Rock! where teachers will be honored. Teachers will be provided a special portal to view powerful learning analytics and reports. •\tWe will invite community role models and celebrities to use their privileged position to encourage and motivate the children. What about children who do not have access to the internet at home? •\tWe will work closely with schools (especially enrichment after school programs) and libraries to provide access to LA Kids Rock! outside of school hours. •\tBoth the 12 live sites and the mobile learning lab school bus will play an important role in assisting children without internet access at home. •\tChildren will also be able to use LA Kids Rock! at school. What about children from non-English backgrounds? •\tThere will be a special section for the more than 30% of Los Angeles children who are English language learners. This will assist children in their vocabulary and speaking skills. How will the curriculum be chosen? •\tThe reading and math content will be closely aligned to Common Core State Standards. How will LA Kids Rock! motivate children? •\tChildren will find the actual learning games highly engaging. •\tThere will be inbuilt game rewards designed to encourage optimal use. •\tChildren and schools will be entered into a draw for “money can’t buy” prizes. We are planning for 20 children and accompanying parents to attend an LA Lakers game along with a “meet the players” afterwards. There will also be three school prizes where key LA sport franchises will visit the winning schools. •\tLA Kids Rock! will make it easy for parents, grandparents and teachers to say “Great Job!” to children. We know this to be one of the most important motivators of all. How will it impact the education indicator? •\tLA Kids Rock! will lift reading and math test scores •\tChildren will be more engaged and positive in their learning •\tLA Kids Rock! will support teachers in their vital role •\tLower high school dropout rates in years to come •\tBring the community together to focus on supporting children’s learning •\tDecrease the disparity between the education “haves” and “have-nots.”",

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "verynice",
    "summary": "When you are making a billion dollars a year, it is easy to donate a million to a good cause. When you are a small business, or an independent contractor, likely bringing in a revenue that is barely pushing 6 figures, it is really hard to give back. We’ve seen lots of success from models over the years such as the One Laptop per Child initiative, and the famous One for One model from TOMS that proceeded it, but what about the service business? What model of business can be created to turn philanthropy into an integral and viable component of service-oriented business? We hear about billionaires like Bill Gates giving away half of their net-worth upon death, but is that kind of impact really limited to the mega-rich? What would a very nice business look like? 5 years ago I founded a company called verynice to begin to answer these questions. verynice is a full service design and innovation consultancy that is dedicated to disrupting the way the design industry operates. Over 50% of our efforts are given away for free to non-profit organizations around the world. I chose to settle on the “over 50%” philanthropy model because it is my philosophy that anything you spend less than 50% of your time doing is just an extracurricular activity. To have a true impact, I believe we need to make giving back an integral component (at least 50%) of our daily lives. Over the course of 5 years, we have had the pleasure of donating our services to over 200 non-profit organizations, all adding up to a pro-bono dollar amount of close to $750,000. By the beginning of 2014, if all goes according to plan, we will have hit the million dollar mark in donated services. All of this with a staff of 7 people in our downtown LA office, and over 170 people located around the world. A recent article in Harvard Business Review estimates that the annual marketing and design expenditure amongst non-profit organizations in the United States alone is a whopping 7.6 Billion dollars. Let’s put that into perspective. $7.6 Billion dollars can but up to 100,000 homes in the United States. $7.6 Billion dollars can provide over 1 Million college educations. For about a dollar a day, World Vision estimates that a child in an impoverished community can be granted access to fresh water, nutritious food, healthcare, and even an education. Imagine, then, what could be accomplished with the spare funding that would result from the eradication of marketing and design expenditures amongst non-profit organizations… So here is the thing. Myself and the people at verynice have been able to donate the equivalent of $750k. That is amazing, and I have seen the impact that saved money has had on these organizations, but at the end of the day, it took us 5 years to accomplish that. Here is the other harsh reality check - $750k is only .01% of the amount of money non-profits are spending each and every year. That is just not enough. We can’t do this alone anymore. If we truly want to create a world in which any and all marketing and design expenditures belonging to non-profit organizations are eliminated, we need to get serious about the replication of our model. My vision for verynice has never been to build a big successful business. Instead, the vision has always been to build a big and successful model that is capable of replicating itself by inspiring others to leverage it as their own. To do this, I am launching a new project, beverynice, which is a platform for inspiring and holding accountable independent contractors and small business owners for their philanthropy by offering resources and tools to make “extreme philanthropy” a viable endeavor in the small business arena. All of that is getting a bit ahead of myself, but to start this long-term journey, I am creating a “beverynice startup-kit” that will completely open-source the verynice business model for other entrepreneurs in service-oriented business at large (consultants, doctors, designers, lawyers, hairstylists, etc.) to leverage. If all goes according to plan, this startup-kit will pave the way for a successful replication of our model. There is no company in the world that comes close to matching our pro-bono ration while still maintaining profitability. I sincerely hope that this project creates more competition for us. To get started, I already have assembled a team of 14 entrepreneurs / beverynice “alpha testers” from around the world that have expressed specific interest in leveraging verynice’s business model in their own companies, and I am mentoring them all free of charge to make that happen. I have a lot of long-term plans for this project, but in the interest of beging specific for this application, the project’s scope will include the completion, production, distribution, and dissemination of my toolkit, to make Los Angeles a leader in small business philanthropy.",

    "title": "The CITYstage Arts Discovery Project",
    "slug": "2013/the-citystage-arts-discovery-project",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "CITYstage",
    "summary": "Imagine the anticipation: a curtain rises on a magnificent stage; the crowd hushes as orchestral horns and violins burst forth; dancers leap and seem to defy gravity; something magical has occurred. It’s happening right here in your own community, but you’ll never experience it. You’re just a kid, you could never afford a ticket, and no one could take you there. In fact, this world of captivating performance and art isn’t part of your world at all. But it could be. Thousands of LA kids ages 12-18 have never been to a professional performing arts production in dance, music or theatre. Many have never even taken a performing arts class. In fact, less than 10% of LAUSD middle school students receive instruction in a comprehensive arts program. CITYstage would like to change that. Founded in direct response to the diminishing performing arts programs in LA, CITYstage is a non-profit dedicated to inspiring and preparing inner city youth to become the future performers and arts leaders in the Los Angeles community. Currently, CITYstage provides tuition-free summer and afterschool programs in the performing arts for underserved middle and high school students of LAUSD. But this is not enough. Answering the Goldhirsch Foundation’s call to provide more opportunities for participation in and support of cultural and artistic activities, CITYstage proposes an Arts Discovery Project for youth. The goal of this program is to recruit, train and retain the next generation of creative artists. How would the Arts Discovery Project do this? To start, youth would take part in “field trips” to professional stage events, such as Alvin Ailey at the Music Center, Lion King at the Pantages, or the LA Phil at Walt Disney Concert Hall. It’s Saturday. Imagine going to the Pantages Theatre with 49 of your classmates to see the Lion King. Before leaving for the show, you learn about the costumes and puppetry that bring the animals to life, explore the themes of the story, and learn the lyrics to “Hakuna Matata” which you discover means, “No worries.” With much excitement, you are finally off to see the show! You arrive at the most beautiful theatre you have ever seen – the historic Pantages – where 50 ft. high dancers and giraffe puppets ascend the aisles amid thundering African beats. You’ve never experienced anything like it. Something magical is happening! After the performance, you meet the cast, see the puppets up close and get to ask all your burning questions. After school on Monday, the Arts Discovery staff brings in a puppet from the show and introduces you to African drumming and dance classes that you weren’t even aware were available in your very own neighborhood. In an effort to increase access for youth participation in “formal” arts in Los Angeles, the CITYstage Arts Discovery Project would provide tickets and transportation for 50 LAUSD youth to attend 9 events (3 Theatre, 3 Dance, 3 Music) for a total reach of 450 youth per year. The project would foster awareness and appreciation of LA’s rich cultural offerings, making professional performing art accessible for low-income youth. According to a recent study by the Arts Education Partnership, even a small exposure can effectively result in long-term participation in the performing arts. In addition to arts “field trips,” the Arts Discovery Project would host free weekly community events, where art would be taught, learned, appreciated and shared. Fridays, from 6-8 p.m., LA residents would present art from their neighborhood and culture in an informal setting at Art Share LA. For example, dancers from Ballet Folklorico de Los Angeles might perform and instruct the audience in Mexico’s traditional dances. It’s Friday night. Female dancers appear in colorfully embroidered skirts that seem to spin and dance on their own. Live mariachi guitars and trumpets resound with joyful, energetic melodies. Men in traditional Mexican costume stomp out powerful, percussive dance steps that interweave with the music. Your pride as an Angeleno grows as you begin to realize the diverse cultural heritage of LA. The eyes of parents in the audience light up as the value of a traditional art is passed down to a new generation. With the Arts Discovery Project’s collaborative approach, we can impact the indicators identified by the Goldhirsch Foundation. Fieldtrips for 450 students to attend professional arts performances will increase youth access to and participation in the arts, as well as fostering support and building a youth audience for formal art in the concert setting. Additionally, the project’s community events will provide weekly opportunities for youth arts enrichment within their own neighborhood. Introducing our youth to a mix of formal and informal, institutional and community arts affords our students many points of entry in our effort to recruit, retain and train the next generation of artists and leaders in the LA arts scene.",

You are reminded of 6th grade when you took your fist CITYstage Arts Discovery “field trip” to see the Alvin Ailey company at the Music Center. The agility and grace of the dancers inspired you to try a dance class in your community. For the next 7 years, you attended classes at CITYstage and Lula Washington Dance Theatre and experienced breathtaking performances through the annual Arts Discovery “field trips.” You realize now that the introduction and continued exposure to the arts as a child helped you grow into the passionate, creative and dedicated teacher you are today.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Since our inception in 2010, CITYstage has served over 100 of LA’s at-risk middle and high school youth with tuition-free performing arts instruction in the disciplines of dance, music and theatre. Our first pilot program at Manual Arts High School provided 25 students with free dance instruction and resulted in all program graduates going on to attend 4-year universities, as well as continuing to pursue the arts."

    "organization": "Swipe Out Hunger",
    "summary": "In September 2009, “Swipes for the Homeless” was established as an official university student organization at UCLA in order to help alleviate the destitution of the neighboring homeless community, specifically the growing homeless student population. Having seen on-campus students collect hot meals for the needy in past years, UCLA students Thach Nguyen and Bryan Pezeshki came up with a brilliant idea. They set out to create a partnership between the multiple campus departments to fully institutionalize a program that would allow the impact and influence of their idea to grow to its full potential. What exactly was this idea? On-campus residents with meal plans that allow them to roll over unused meals from week to week, tend to accrue many unused meals, or “swipes”, by the end of each academic quarter. At the end of the quarter, these students can donate their unused meal swipes, which would otherwise go to waste, to Swipes for the Homeless. These swipes are then transferred into non-perishable goods and then taken to homeless shelters, homeless living on the streets, and homeless and hungry students on campus. In addition, many other sub-projects target wasted food in the residential dining halls, fast-food eateries on campus, and community businesses in order to salvage that food for those less fortunate on a daily basis. The organization has collected over 30,000 meals to date, with a record of 7,421 meals this past university quarter The simplicity and effectiveness of this idea quickly led to its expansion onto numerous college campuses worldwide, amongst those being USC, UC Berkeley and University of Paris in France. In April of 2012, after a nationwide search and vetting of thousands of applicants, President Obama recognized our organization as one of five “Champions of Change,” personally inviting our group to the White House to honor us for our impact on the community. “Swipes” has since become a state-certified 501(c)3 non- profit organization with the aim of spreading its impact on to every campus in the world. Although our main indicator would be “housing,” Swipes for the Homeless affects several other indicators on many different levels. For example, our dual mission is to tangibly and tactically partner with college campuses to alleviate hunger while raising young people’s awareness of homelessness and hunger through education and outreach. Through this we hope to facilitate the spirit of giving and volunteerism, a crucial component of social connectedness. Swipes for the Homeless is also environmentally-focused because it helps University campuses reduce their food waste. We understand that all indicators and social issues are inter-connected, and that improving one area would correlate with an improvement in another indicator.",

    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "Since its humble beginnings, Swipes for the Homeless has donated over 35,000 pounds of food just in Los Angeles and thousands of additional meals around the nation. In fact, we have recorded a whopping number of 57,268 pounds of food donated as of January 2013! All of this couldn’t have been done without our dedicated university chapters. We are continuing to spread our mission to university campuses, and additional students from over 30 universities have recently reached out to us to establish a chapter on their perspective campuses. Swipes for the Homeless has been featured in many publications and media outlets such as the Los Angeles Times, MTV, GOOD Magazine, Forbes, UCLA Magazine, and many others. Our biggest (and most exciting) achievement to date was when our organization was recognized by President Barack Obama as a Campus Champion of Change in 2011. The Champions of Change challenge was launched by the White House to honor five young leaders for outstanding leadership on their college campuses. After reviewing a record number of entries, fifteen Challenge finalists were announced and the public chose the top five projects they think best embody the President’s goal to win the future. Swipes for the Homeless was voted as one of the top five! Our members were honored with the opportunity to travel to the White House and personally meet Obama for a press conference with the other winners. In 2012, Swipes for the Homeless was also recognized as Most Influential College Organization at the 2012 Stay Classy Awards, the largest philanthropic recognition ceremony in America. From these various recognitions, we have been blessed with the opportunity to bring this important cause to further light on the national media scale, and would like to thank all of our supporters who have been with us every step of the way.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "According to a 2012 article in the Huffington Post, “more than 51,000 homeless people live in Los Angeles County, from Antelope Valley to the South Bay, with double-digit percentage increases in the number of families, seniors and veterans over last year.” The LA2050 website quotes that “Los Angeles is considered the ‘homeless capital of the country.’” Swipes for the Homeless is especially prominent and beneficial in Los Angeles because of two main reasons. Firstly, the statistics tell all – there is a strong need for support and services for the local homeless population. With such a large homeless population and shelters lacking in resources, every act of giving and every helping hand counts. We hope that Swipes for the Homeless has helped – and will continue to – alleviate the strain on homeless shelters and missions in Los Angeles. In addition, Swipes for the Homeless has two very strong chapters that are based in Los Angeles – UCLA and USC. UCLA is our oldest and most established chapter, with a fully self-sufficient and independent team that runs smoothly every quarter. USC is a relatively newer chapter, but during their first donation drive in Fall 2012 the Trojans managed to collect 2,300 pounds of food! Despite the friendly rivalry between both schools, here is a wonderful example where students from rival universities can work together for a greater cause. Combined, our UCLA and USC chapters prove to be a strong force that is united in its mission to fight homelessness in Los Angeles and its surrounding areas.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Our dual mission is to tangibly and tactically partner with college campuses to alleviate hunger while raising young people’s awareness of homelessness and hunger through education and outreach. Because of our commitment to fighting homelessness, our vision for the year 2050 would be a large national decrease in (if not a complete eradication of) homelessness, especially amongst the student population. We hope that through our advocacy and outreach on this issue, we can influence and mobilize youth for generations to come. In addition, we would also like to see a reduction in food waste across campus dining halls on a national level. The future of the environment is already in jeopardy, and it is frightening to think what our cities will look like in the year 2050 if we don’t take action to reduce waste and implement sustainable measures now. Ultimately, we want to advocate for the idea that each individual person, each small act of kindness or helping hand can make a difference in the lives of others.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Swipes for the Homeless has engaged with several organizations and companies that span across a wide range of industries. For example, we have conducted talks with companies such as TowelSafe (a cutting-edge company with a program that allows people to donate one pocketed towel with a toiletry kit to a local homeless individual) and KNOclothing (a socially-minded business that donates an article of clothing to those in need for every purchase). Our talks have focused on partnership possibilities and ways that we can support each other. Recently, Swipes for the Homeless collaborated with Ebay's Giving Works program. Through this program,customers can donate to a non-profit or charity of their choice, simply by buying or selling an item.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "The meaning of success for us is multi-faceted. If the past three years have served as any evidence, we anticipate exponential growth and impact. From a pragmatic standpoint, we want to streamline our relationships with our campus chapters by providing more communication, training, and development. Our executive team has spent last summer redefining our vision for the organization and made plans to establish stronger ties with our campus communities. Short-term strategies include institutionalizing quarterly video conferences and developing grant-writing/campus development kits; our long-term strategies include providing financial and web-based support for our individual chapters. These new tools aim to elevate resources available at-hand for our campus leaders. From a high-level vision, our hope and goal is to maximize the impact of our organization by being more intentional about our programming initiatives."

    "slug": "2013/making-la-traffickfree-ending-trafficking-1-community-at-a-time",
    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Oasis USA",
    "summary": "We want to see human trafficking end in Los Angeles and throughout the United States. We believe it is possible to end human trafficking 1 COMMUNITY at a time using a multi-sectored approach that mobilizes and empowers individuals from within the community to address vulnerabilities for trafficking in their own local area. Oasis has developed the TraffickFree Community (TFC) model to mobilize and equip citizens to lead local, grassroots action by working with 8 key stakeholders with the collective power to end slavery. To initiate this kind of change in LA, Oasis would like to start 10 new TFCs by the end of 2013. Human Trafficking is a global problem with a local face that will only be effectively addressed as local communities take responsibility for responding to specific issues in their area. Oasis was founded in the 1980s in London with a vision for community transformation; it’s now grown to 10 countries across the world, each fighting human trafficking by empowering local communities. In the US, the secret to success is the TFC model of local ownership by citizen leaders who leverage their social capital for cooperative change that benefits the whole community. Oasis provides the necessary training and support to build skills and opportunities that foster mutual trust and constructive social interaction. Oasis has identified 8 key community stakeholders that could potentially engage with the life of someone who has been trafficked – schools, local business, consumers, media, faith communities/NGOs, first responders, law enforcement and local legislatures. When working together, using their collective power for the benefit of the vulnerable and marginalized, these stakeholders strengthen the community to function as a whole – a place where everyone is included, making a contribution and reaching their ultimate potential. Communities should be healthy, inclusive, integrated, empowering and supportive, where every citizen can experience wholeness and fullness of life. Trafficking is not able to exist or flourish here. The uniqueness of the TFC model is its ability to replicate anti-trafficking campaigns and activities in a variety of contexts, regardless of social, racial, ethnic, socio-economic or other demographic factors. Each TFC looks different because each community is different. Therefore, it is essential that local citizen leaders from within the community drive the vision, strategy and activities of a TFC. TFCs are catalysts that motivate, encourage and lead by example, united by a common ideology that trafficking has no place in our communities – in LA or globally. 10 new TFCs will be strategically established throughout LA using the following criteria: •\tproximity to known trafficking routes; •\tcommitted and engaged citizen leaders; •\texisting anti-trafficking networks and momentum. In addition to receiving training on the global and local dynamics of trafficking, new TFC participants will be trained in research design to discover the vulnerabilities and issues specific to their community. They will learn how to engage the 8 stakeholders, first focusing on existing networks and those that influence the most significant vulnerabilities in their communities. Empowered with information and strategies for engaging the resources and networks necessary for bringing about change, Oasis will continue to develop, resource and support these citizen leaders to act - creating stronger more connected communities. Additionally, these new TFCs will have the opportunity to engage and learn from one another and existing TFCs - sharing best practices, team and community building techniques, advocacy tools, challenges and stories. Furthermore, Oasis will equip these civic leaders to be creative catalysts empowered to educate, organize, train and lead others. In addition to creating 10 new TFCs, Oasis will sponsor and facilitate no less than 10 additional community engagement events. These events will provide models for awareness and outreach events, while resourcing new TFCs with a solid foundation on which they can build their networks and implement strategies specific to the needs of their communities. Such events could include general human trafficking awareness and education for Angelinos, specialized stakeholder trainings, leadership and community building workshops, and strategic listening groups between stakeholders (e.g. police and youth; police and first responders; teachers, parents and students; businesses and consumers).. Effective collaboration and partnership between and amongst TFCs requires efficient and user friendly communication tools and platforms. Part of this project will invest in communication tools, training curriculum, campaign promotional materials, marketing and/or other resources for training and supporting TFCs as they work to educate, engage and unite their community in the fight against slavery.",

The new TFCs will greatly benefit from our networks and resources as a founding member of the L.A. Anti-Trafficking Task Force, and our close relationships with two leading LA NGOs - the Coalition Against Slavery and Trafficking and Saving Innocence. These partners, including local and federal law enforcement, city/county agencies, political officials, NGOs, and direct service providers can contribute their expertise and field experience through training, networking, workshop participation and city-wide event promotion."

It would be hands-on, where real people would get to shake hands and listen to each other’s stories. If this were a happening thing, it would give affluent people a simple way to be volunteers, where it wouldn’t be a big decision for each individual about which organization to give themselves to, but the group nature of it and the widespread practice would make it a natural for many people to participate. One of the unofficial ways I “give” is to the people who work for me, who clean my house and do my gardening. I am generous to them beyond the fees they charge for their services. When you know people personally, if you are of a generous nature it is very satisfying to help them. This would be the same thing, writ large and systematized. So, let a block from Beverly Hills get to know a block from South Central, with the idea of seeing how they can help. Facilitation would be needed at the start. And meeting places, like schools or banks or community rooms. But it is so simple and so doable and could be so far reaching, even creating a model program for the rest of the world.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2013",
    "organization": "Union de Vecinos",
    "summary": "Just like TreePeople has trained and organized volunteers to plant trees, Union de Vecinos proposes to train and organize 1,000s of Angeleno volunteers to design and build DIY social space for their neighborhoods. Los Angeles’ social connectedness deficit is rooted in our poorly maintained car dominated streets, alleys and neighborhoods. Most Angelenos wish for a more walkable, safer, neighborly environment, but see no way they can make a change when even the simplest public space project seems to take years and hundreds of thousands of dollars. We think we have found a solution: DIY social spaces created by volunteers in a few months for a few thousand dollars. In the last year we have, brought neighbors together in five locations in Boyle Heights to use their DIY ingenuity and innovation creating create shared spaces of social connectedness. This included transforming streets and alleys by building physical improvements and organizing activities to reclaim the space. Our vision for 2013 is to organize Boyle Heights neighbors to build DIY social spaces across the community so every resident lives within two blocks of a local commons . Our project will also create the tools and materials that will enable us to help Angelenos replicate this process across the city. Neighbors building their own shared social space, builds social connectedness in many ways. •\tBarn Raising— This is where neighbors share time, tools, skills, food. Together, they build relationships that flourish long after the last nail is driven. •\tClaiming and Shaping Shared Space – Through the project neighbors create their own public space which deepens their commitment to the neighborhood and recruits other residents to do the same. •\tSparking Conversations and Relationships - Over time there will be 100s of spontaneous connections made by residents who meet or cross paths in the space during the course of the project’s life changing the quality of relationships between neighbors. Our process engages the local neighborhood’s untapped potential by bringing people together to address common neighborhood problems. We start by building Networks of Neighborhood Committees, composed of neighborhood residents that make a commitment to work together to make positive changes in their local neighborhood. These changes include building a team that creates opportunities to get to know your neighbors and to together to build simple DIY projects that have long lasting and transformative impacts in the community. In Boyle Heights, we began organizing activities on our streets and in our alleys such as regular cleanups, movie nights, mercados, and childrens activities. This started to transform spaces that had been deemed unsafe into healthy, thriving, and desirable places to live where neighbors can play, be active, and engage in constructive community building activities. However organized activities alone cannot fully complete a transformation. When no activity is occurring, the streets and alleys can look and feel empty. We have realized that we needed to reinforce the impact of our activities with physical improvements to create and promote sustainable active and healthy alleys. In addition, given limited municipal resources, we found ways to make the physical improvements that led into immediate changes with low investment , and without waiting for it to be done for us, but rather by doing it ourselves. To provide an example, one of our neighborhood committees, called Bienestar, identified a specific alley as problematic. It was unlit, dark, filled with potholes, and painted with graffiti. Residents also complained about the need for space next to their homes in which children could play safely. Last year, this committee came up with a plan to transform the alley into a small plaza. They organized regular cleanups and removed the graffiti. The youth in the neighborhood designed a mural and received permission to paint it on one of the buildings. As the city did not have resources to repave the alley, neighbors was able to raise money to buy materials and the residents donated the labor and repaved the alley themselves. They also installed solar lighting and designed and built planters. Finally, they finished painting a design on the floor of the repaved alley. Today, when the residents want to bring their children outside they use the planters to close the alley to cars and create a small plaza in front of the mural they painted. This was all accomplished with 6 months, less than $3,200. By adding countless volunteer hours, the considerable skills of neighborhood residents and the passion and ownership that comes from doing it yourself, we were able to transform an alley for a small fraction of the time and resources the City or anyone else would spend to have the same impact. This is an example of neighbors taking initiative coming together to rebuild their city one block at a time.",

For this project we will be partnering with Shared Spaces, a landscape architecture partnerships. We will also be working with local business especially those that line the alleys along the commercial corridors in Boyle Heights. Other partners include the LA Human Right to Housing Collective, Green LA, and the artist collective Ultrared.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?": "Our criteria for evaluating our progress is rooted in three core questions: 1) Has our strategy engaged, empowered, and activated new community residents to participate in the project?; 2) Have our strategies strengthened relationships and collaborations between local neighborhoods? and 3) Did we transform the alleys into safe and healthy environments? If not, what were the obstacles to accomplishing this? Evaluation of the work occurs monthly with staff and community members. We also will review the number of alleys transformed, whether the alleys have a core group of community members committed to maintaining them, the costs and labor involved, and where additional resources can be found.",
    "What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?": "Success for us would be that every alley in Boyle Heights would have a group of dedicated community members working to maintain and transform their alley. Success would mean that there are physical improvement projects that were built in the alleys such as solar lighting, greening of the alleys, street furniture, bulletin boards, etc. Success would mean that community members would organize activities in the alleys so that the space was not just a place for cars and trash but a place to come together and build community. Success would mean that other communities in Los Angeles would grasp this form of transformative change and replicate it in their local neighborhoods.",
    "What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?": "In 2000 we won a Best Practice award for our community organizing from the United Nations’ Huairou Commission. In our model, solutions to a problem are developed by those most affected. It places the community first and at the center of our work. We take a bottom up approach. We start with the community’s understanding of their problems and engage the community in addressing these issues. We organize block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood and bring this network together. We do this through reflection, action, analysis and start again with each phase bringing new information. Through this process community members learn to negotiate and prioritize their demands amongst themselves. Our organizing campaigns as identified by our community members include the following: preservation of healthy affordable housing; the right to clean water; the right to clean air; and the right to safe and healthy neighborhoods.",
    "How will your project benefit Los Angeles?": "Our vision for 2050 is a city where DIY social spaces are more common than gas stations, Starbucks, liquor stores or police cars. A city where each neighborhood, each set of blocks, has its neighborhood space where people regularly meet, catch-up on the news and gossip, hatch new projects and just enjoy being connected."
