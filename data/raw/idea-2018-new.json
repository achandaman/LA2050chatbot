    "organization": "The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's",
    "summary": "YouthCare is the most affordable intergenerational respite and memory care program that partners trained college student volunteers and persons with early-stage dementia in a community-based setting.",
    "goal": "LIVE",
    "projectRanking": "Honorable Mention",
    "How will your activation mobilize Angelenos?​": "Trainings and/or in-person engagements",
    "How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to LIVE​": "Our program provides positive benefits for Angelenos affected with dementia, their family members, and students. Our ability to reach the maximum number of Angelenos requires three key steps, all of which we are working towards addressing already.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​": "Our program addresses three key demographics: students, older adults with Alzheimer’s or dementia, and their caregivers. We plan to measure our success based on the qualitative feedback from these three groups, as well as our quantitative impact.",
    "Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.": "YouthCare is the most affordable intergenerational respite and memory care program anywhere. For three hours, twice a week, student-senior pairs play games, participate in artistic activities, and deliver the research-backed Brain Boot Camp to help address cognitive decline. If our program reaches 17% of Angelenos with dementia and allows them to age at home for just two more months, we will save the healthcare system five-billion dollars.",
    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to LIVE?​": "One of the most difficult realities of a dementia diagnosis is that there are no effective treatments for the disease, nor is there a cure. We do, however, have the opportunity to mitigate the difficulties of its decline. As the rates of this disease double in the next twelve years, effectively bankrupting our healthcare system, cities that implement avant-garde solutions to address its care will be ones that stand out in the international challenge to solve what is likely to be the greatest public health crisis of modern history.",

    "Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?": "In 5 years, we plan to transform access to care in Los Angeles to seed it as the world’s leader in respite care provision. Our organization is connected with national and international leading Alzheimer’s nonprofits, and all of them have remarked that our organization has been the first to create this unique intergenerational social enterprise. We believe we can scale rapidly to at least forty of the one hundred and one colleges in LA county -- servicing over 1000 Angelenos annually. For each senior that we service, we will also be inspiring another student to enter fields of Alzheimer’s and Aging. Our confidence stems from our development of a strong referral system that expands into all parts of the county and because we are investing in the development of mobile-based technology that will seamlessly bring together students and seniors and lower our cost-to-client by 33% in the next three years."

This diverse community, with new Latin American immigrants, indigenous communities, and historic Black communities (of diverse ethnicities), will be reached through door knocking and mini pop-up events in the corridor where we will share information and build relationships to invite them to the larger “Street Beats” and smaller “Rise and Shine” activiations. Each event is likely to bring around 150-300 active participants and all participants will have interactions via social media hashtags with prizes as incentives to tag us to help bring attention to their stories and the project. Our secondary audience will be Angelenos at large, public agencies, and community based organizations doing similar work who will be reached through indirect means listed below.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​": "Our achievable goals for the duration of this project will help lay the foundation to make zero loss of life for this community a reality. Rates of volunteerism will go up in this corridor by 50% using a baseline of membership that each group currently has in the corridor through providing public and open streets events that are multicultural and multilingual. This will foster opportunities to reduce racial segregation amongst the diverse population in the community. Our goal is to reach 2,500 community members in the corridor to receive social and emotional support through resources and education regarding the complexity of law enforcement and renters’ rights. Cultural events will include the development of a community-shaped narrative about the community’s identity, values, and needs through the documentation and curation of 30-50 diverse community stories. Additionally, images of the community and their history is present in the built environment through communal art making. Lastly, through this effort our goal is to increase government responsiveness to residents’ needs around the built environment and housing policy.",

We will bring students together with adults from outside their communities, and will work closely with our corporate partners in order to ensure we have enough volunteers to complete service projects all over the city. We rely heavily on our corporate partners to recruit and bring in volunteers to help us complete our projects. Past corporate partners have included Comcast NBCUniversal, Sony, Aramark, Hulu, The LA Clippers, Starbucks, Holland & Knight, Dreamhost, The Wonderful Company, AT&T, TSA, The Honest Company, and the LA Rams. We also partner with independent schools in Los Angeles to complete service projects, helping students learn the value of service together with their families. Additionally, we engage our own Board of Directors and Associates Board to help bring together people from their networks to engage in projects. Of course, our most important partner and collaborator is the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). We work closely with LAUSD to determine which schools most need our help and can benefit from our service. These are the places we most frequently deploy our volunteers.",

We know a Day of Service has been successful when our volunteers leave feeling engaged and educated about our work, and when a school is happy with the work we have done. In order to measure success with our volunteers, we use volunteer surveys. It is always our goal that based on these surveys, we maintain a Net Promotor Score of 90 or above for each project. This shows us that volunteers believe the day was enjoyable, well-organized, and had an impact on the community.",

It is our hope that this activation will serve as a catalyst to further grow our services and partnerships in Los Angeles. Through our activation we will grow the number of corporations and individuals in the city who know about our work, and will also have the opportunity for forge new relationships with schools we haven’t had an opportunity to work with yet.

However, air pollution was once so bad that people were forced inside. Our oceans were unsafe to swim in. Through the tireless work of environmental nonprofit organizations Los Angeles we overcame these challenges, and while we have come a long way, there is a lot more that needs to be done. We need a sustainable energy infrastructure, oceans free of plastic pollution and clean air to breathe. We rely on organizations like the Coalition for Clean Air, the Surfrider Foundation and the US Green Building Council to advance these changes. Yet while we rely on the nonprofit environmental sector for transformative change, they operate in an extremely resource-limited field. Only 3% of charitable giving in 2015 went towards environmental issues. That is where we come in.",

This data will include accessibility concerns (width, incline, barriers, etc), general attributes (cleanliness, potholes, weeds, etc) as well as add local-specific attributes, shade hours for example.

    "How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to LIVE​": "For all of us who have walked around LA, it’s impossible not to notice the poor condition of our sidewalks. From buckled concrete, to lack of shade, to missing curb cuts to whole neighborhoods that don’t even have sidewalks, we’ve surrendered transportation to motorized vehicles. It is simply unpleasant to walk in many of LA’s neighborhoods. This steers people away from healthy walking lifestyles, as well as away from using transit because getting to the bus or rail station is difficult or unpleasant.",

A recent review of studies on the relationship between poverty and disasters in the U.S. by Fothergill & Peek revealed that socio-economic status is a significant predictor of the physical and psychological impacts in the pre- and post- disaster stages. Using a platform developed by Palantir, Team Rubicon maps neighborhoods that are most vulnerable from a socio-economic standpoint by overlaying tax records, insurance information, and census data. In many cases these communities lack the tax-base to provide professional, community based disaster services, or are overshadowed by wealthier areas impacted by the same disaster. Within urban areas, Team Rubicon’s focus is often on communities of color and non-native English speakers. These communities are disproportionately impacted by disasters, lack the personal or community-based resources to fend for themselves, and cannot agitate for government support as effectively as their affluent neighbors.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​": "Team Rubicon understands the value of collecting both qualitative and quantitative data when conveying the impact of our programs on the community. We measure our impact two ways: impact we have on the communities experiencing a disaster and impact on the lives of our volunteer members.

    "Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?": "Team Rubicon strives to recruit and train thousands of new volunteers in Los Angeles and throughout the country. By focusing on localized preparedness, we hope to build more resilient communities that will be prepared for disasters whenever they strike. Team Rubicon's ultimate goals are to empower volunteers to responsibly and cost-effectively respond to disasters, serve vulnerable communities affected by disasters, and create a more resilient Los Angeles."

    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to CREATE?​": "Minorities and women have registered gains in several key areas of television but remained disproportionately represented in most areas of the entertainment industry, according to the 2018 Hollywood Diversity Report by UCLA. This year, there has been an impact of diverse representation as seen through films like Coco, Black Panther & Ava Duvernay’s A Wrinkle in Time in the box office figures and viewer ratings. America’s audience demand for inclusivity has resonated throughout the entertainment industry and we’re seeing the shift in the growing need for content creators to create more of these inclusive stories. By the year 2050, minorities will become the majority and for Los Angeles’ biggest industries, the need not only for diverse stories in entertainment but a more inclusive workforce, is imminent. Since it’s inception, NALIP’s mission is to advance Latinx content creators and their careers by providing resources and guidance in order to provide more accurate representation behind the camera, from producers to directors to even those just starting their career. With the Emerging Content Creator Inclusion Initiative, NALIP aims to support ALL creators from diverse backgrounds in preparing them to enter the media workforce. The Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative will help make a LA the best place to create by providing access to college ready youth and those interested in media opportunities to learn and prepare for the entertainment industry workforce. It is intended to be an informative step by step guide for young content creators to successfully transition into the industry through forums, networking, mentoring, summer programs, workshops, and funding college-entry projects. Top industry professionals will share their insights and experience, along with some of their biggest challenges. Through the physical, and digital platforms NALIP will provide, the ECC Inclusion Initiative will reach over 100,000 Angelenos and promote the advancement of emerging talent, reach youth and create awareness. With the support from LA2050, the Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative will be able to stand as its own program by funding additional staff, supporting the production of workshops, digital team, funding production of projects as well as aid in leveraging NALIP’s industry partners such as CAA, Youtube, CBS, Google, and more by providing participants access to mentorship/job opportunities after undergoing the program. The initiative will aid in bridging the gap between diverse content creators and the media companies that need them, creating more opportunities for underrepresented communities as well as providing more representation in the media landscape. As a result of the ECC Inclusion Initiative, college ready youth will be able to gain access to resources in regards to both film/media universities and serve as a pipeline to the entertainment job market in Los Angeles to give a more diverse, equitable, and creative Los Angeles.",

We, the kids, will build up our community, and Larchmont Social Justice Youth Alliance will collect our voices and set them free.",
    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to CONNECT?​": "As the world has seen, high school students in Parkland, Florida, have made their community, and the world, a better place. Florida is notoriously gun-friendly place, yet the students were able to lead common-sense gun law reform when their voices were raised and heard. Larchmont Charter School believes student voices need to be raised and heard on social justice issues in Los Angeles. Our student population is 40% low income, and we serve students from all over the city. They KNOW what poverty is, and are confronted by its confines every day. Larchmont Charter School, a grades K- 12 school, has established itself as one of the top performing public schools in Los Angeles. Unique among public charter networks in our focus on racial, ethnic, and socio-economic diversity, Larchmont Charter School aims to provide a richly diverse community of students with a high quality public education. Social justice is woven into the mission of our school, and who better to rally youthful members of the community to fight injustice but our students? The Larchmont Social Justice Alliance will pivot from this deeply held value system into an activist platform. Joining student voices toward social justice, our Poetry Slam Competition (already a prominent feature in our curriculum and in student life in the upper grades) will support a new level of community activism. Our students can reach more students through guided use of social media, events, civic-minded field trips, and historical perspective on the importance of politics. We want to empower young members of the community with literary avenues for their voices, as well as rallies, service learning, and spoken word. This alliance seeks to use the power of student voices for social change. Homelessness, environmental degradation, and immigration are 3 issues that affect our population. Those are 3 among many our students want to improve. We plan to measure how many new students are reached with a pro-change message, how many new members of the community join us, and what impact we have in the community through social media analytics and surveys. We are happy to join the initiatives of My LA2050 to drive a strong, united, youth-driven message for social justice.",
    "How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to CONNECT​": "Our activation will require strategic effort to make student voices for social change heard. We plan to make use of our talented faculty, and this grant will allow us to deploy the brain power and leadership of our educators in service of the student voice. Our budget includes funds to pay our selected faculty to help student leaders strategize effective social change. This will include 1.) prioritizing top issues around which to rally, with relevant research (including student-led research) on what bills and local initiatives need ballot support or protest; we are interested in gathering youth around the common cause of social change and the action required to make it; timelines for activation need to be built; with student leaders, we will define goals and build a media strategy to achieve them; we will use strategic social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, etc.) to promote our events, rallies, partnerships with other youth groups, issues, literary interpretations of events, and historical and political context for our initiatives. We will also build a sense of unity with tee shirts and field trips that include students from all over the city.

Potential hyperlocal leaders will be identified & supported through a network of resident leaders from over 400 of LA’s densest blocks.",
    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to CONNECT?​": "Los Angeles has a history of trucks rolling down the street to deliver value. From the Helms bakery trucks and their baked goods-announcing whistle to the iconic twang jingle of an ice cream truck drew families from their homes on summer nights and weekends to join together for a cool treat, trucks called people from their homes to meet on the street. In the 21st century, Angelenos continue to expect mobile delivery of what they want from the Kogi-launched gourmet food truck industry to Amazon’s on-demand packages. Yes, people are more connected than ever to the world but less so to their neighbors. Learning from the past, The BlockMobile models home-delivery of treats and goods and applies that to civic engagement and neighborhood leadership."

We plan to do that and more with this activation! There are currently 63,000 youth in Los Angeles that can be classified as homeless. During the summer months there are very few programs that offer support, even fewer that are free. Summer engagement is directly related to high school reading levels, school year attendance, and school year academic success.

Moreover, facilitating KidBot at more sites enables students to compete against their LA’s BEST peers during regional competitions in addition to non-affiliated schools.",

It is amazing to bridge the gap between our communities (those doing well and those not) because we are all human and we want children to realize that at a young age. Homelessness can happen to anyone and without help these people cannot get back on their feet! Kids need to know there is more to life than social media and burst out of the bubble and their comfort zone (at first) to experience this humbling opportunity!",

I Would like to have Stella’s Socks in 5 of the major cities battling homelessness. I think this is a very achievable goal. We can have other kids run the branches and we would get together to do an event all together each and every year. Maybe we can do the barefoot run we mentioned earlier and get all of the branches together to participate! The possibilities are endless. Stella also recently spoke at an LA City City Counsel and was recognized with an award from councilman Mike Bonin for her work in the community.

And as the political tide turns for the right, less and less resources are being made available to them. Through our social media, website and monthly Sock Sesh’ Community Meetups, we engage people all across Los Angeles. Sock sessions inspire kids and families to get involved and connect with their community. From Venice Beach to Skid Row, We motivate young families to ‘give back’ and make our city spectacular. Inspiring Angelinos to work together for the greater good of the city and their struggling neighbors living on the streets. The experiences our volunteers, young & old, have had is something we want to expand. We’ve had kids out at 8am on Venice Beach, barely awake and partially upset they have to be up so early on the weekend and by the end of our sock session everyone is laughing, having a great time and interacting with our homeless population, because they often are the ones who get overlooked and sometimes feel invisible. Angelenos of all economic backgrounds need to work together to make our communities thrive and we hope with Stella’s Socks that we can be that bridge.",

This content development is led by specialists in Latino-focused communications and parent advice experts. We’ve also formed a Latino Advisory Council to help forge new partnerships with grassroots LA organizations serving Latino families.

We want to expand the range of these in-person trainings to other schools and community organizations so they may help more Spanish-speaking families understand the impact of media on their kids and teach them how they can play an active role in helping their kids harness media and potential to its full potential. Our content is readily sharable, and our train-the-trainer model facilitates easy adoption in schools and grass-root organizations.

The tactic of using art to stimulate dialogue, create narratives, foster understanding and compassion, unite diverse communities, and humanize complex, controversial issues has been successful. Local LA artists have created exhibits using actual jail beds, which we know tell a powerful, visual story about the devastating toll mass incarceration takes on society.

Quantitative measures include number of people who attend the event at the LA Film Festival, number of people who submit films for consideration, number of people who view the films on the interactive microsite and on the YouTube playlist and number of people who engage on social media. We aim to engage creators and community members who reflect the broad demographics of Los Angeles across race, gender, ability, sexuality, immigration status and socio-economic status. We will collect these stats to meet program benchmarks. Additionally, qualitative measures include collecting the sentiments of engagement on social media, the points of view and stories we receive from all submissions, not just the selected short films and the conversations that arise out of the LA Film Festival event. We will survey the Festival attendees to ask demographic questions, as well as open ended questions about whether they are inspired to participate in future community discussions, whether they feel like they learned about other neighborhoods in LA, how eager they are to visit neighborhoods across the county, whether or not they connected with the filmmakers on social media and more.",
    "Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.": "To show the diversity and beauty of what it means to live in LA today (and hint at its future), we will engage people through a call for submissions to create films focused on their LA neighborhood or community. 50 films representing 50 LA neighborhoods will be hosted on a playlist on Film Independent’s YouTube channel and on an interactive online map. A free community screening at the 2019 LA Film Festival will feature a selection of these films, followed by a discussion and networking event.",

    "Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?": "We expect that in five years, this map will continue to be a way for Angelenos to learn about the diversity of their community and the different neighborhoods our unique county includes. Film Independent is always exploring ways to increase diversity and inclusion in the film industry and find exciting avenues to engage artists and community members. This activation will further our goals for serving community members and filmmakers alike. It will provide a forum for talented, diverse filmmakers with unique voices to celebrate all that LA offers and encourage their peers to create stories that draw from their own diverse surroundings.",
    "Which of the CONNECT metrics will your activation impact?​": "Attendance at cultural events",
    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to CONNECT?​": "LA is one of the most diverse places on earth and is home to people from every country and culture. It is also home to the film industry — a place that falls dramatically short of reflecting the diversity of Los Angeles. To quote Mayor Garcetti, “When ‘Oscars So White’ and ‘Time’s Up’ put a spotlight on inequality in Hollywood, they captured the frustrations of people shut out of the opportunity in what the world knows as LA’s signature industry.” With Made in LA, we aim to open the door for those opportunities, giving a voice to everyone in LA and creating a more connected sense of community by including these important stories in the conversation. We will empower 50 filmmakers (or 50 filmmaker teams) to show us their LA through a series of shorts to be featured as part of an online interactive map and with select films premiering at the LA Film Festival."

Each client will be registered or continued in individualized case management by the local homeless services organization with whom we are partnering. These pop-ups around the City of LA will demonstrate a practical, neighborhood-based solution to a widely distributed crisis.",
    "Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?": "It is our sincere hope that this activation will become a very self-generating tool / coordination plan for local communities and widely replicated in 5 years, not just in LA but across the state and hopefully other regions in the US. We want to contribute meaningfully towards increased buy-in by a large and diverse cross-section of the public towards new ways of drastically reducing homelessness, including support for the most important preventative, more affordable housing. We hope that the activation will have shown all stakeholders, regardless of their present views on how this crisis should be solved, that those who are homeless can be better connected to services when consistent shelter is provided, and that it takes localized situating of that shelter in order to engage local homeless individuals who have an attachment to place.",

    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to LIVE?​": "We need to rethink what an emergency homeless shelter can look like, where it can be located, and how it can better serve and maintain dignity for those experiencing homelessness. LA has the highest numbers in the country of homeless who are without access to shelter, and we also top the percentage of unsheltered homeless (78%) amongst US urban areas. That means over 45,000 people do not have a sanctioned place to sleep as of the Jan 2017 count; the number will likely be higher once the 2018 count is reported in May, given the 26% rise in homelessness between 2016 to 2017.",

They will be involved in helping to make emergency shelter pop-up sites successful in their own unique communities. Our project will empower them in local decision-making around siting, operating characteristics and, most importantly, how to realize a common goal by using creative resources.

County-wide efforts to address homelessness are critical to systemic shift, yet community level interventions have tangible impact on neighborhood culture, connectedness, safety and health. By taking a local approach to addressing youth homelessness and leveraging key organizational skill sets, Podshare and Safe Place for Youth (SPY) are poised to take on youth homelessness in West LA, improving the lives of housed and unhoused Angelenos alike.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​": "Within 3 months of funding, “SPY by PodShare” will be fully operational with SPY filling the pods and providing services to guests. Over the first 2 years, “SPY by PodShare” will maintain an average nightly occupancy of 95% (19 pods) maximizing our ability to provide immediate night-time shelter to young people in need. SPY Housing Case Managers will work with guests to identify their long-term housing plan and provide supportive day services at the SPY Drop-In Center. Additionally, an on-site case manager will help guests address needs that arise at “SPY by PodShare.” Through this coordinated care, a minimum of 80% of guests will exit “SPY by PodShare” to a higher order housing intervention (i.e. bridge, transitional, rapid rehousing, or permanent supportive housing.) While mental health services will not be mandated for guests to support each person’s right to self-determination, SPY will strive for at least 50% enrollment in wellness supports through youth friendly language and staffing. Similarly, education and employment supports through the SPY drop-in center will be made available to all guests, aiming for 65% enrollment.

In doing so, we will enhance the lives of each guest, intervening in their lives at a critical time and improving their long-term mental health, employment, and housing stability prospects. Additionally, we will engage housed Angelenos in the process, creating a deeper sense of community ownership and connectedness to their city and unhoused neighbors. These dual processes will enhance individual and community well being, and move us towards the LA we all want to achieve. We must act fast if we are going to outpace the rise in the homeless population each year. The LA2050’s goal of having fewer than 1,000 homeless people on the streets by the year 2050 is achievable. PodShare and SPY are here to help get it done.",

Once built, we will jointly fund raise to secure ongoing rent and maintenance costs for the facility, apply for Measure H funds to for basic services and staffing, and use other private funds for additional programming. This activation will decrease the number of homeless Angelinos on our streets and make temporary housing affordable and scalable, helping hundreds of young people find affirming community.",

    "How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to LIVE​": "The Podshare and SPY LA 2050 Activation will focus on engaging housed Angelenos around issues of youth homelessness. The crisis of youth homelessness is currently largely unknown to the broader community. SPY knows from experience that in order to implement successful and lasting strategies to mitigate youth homelessness, it is critical to garner the active support and participation of your surrounding neighbors. Safe Place for Youth has a Street Outreach team that goes out five times a week to places where homeless youth sleep, develops rapport with the young people, and works to connect them to SPY’s on-site programming. In that same way, so too does our plan to engage housed Angelenos focus on building of personal connections that are motivated towards action, whether that’s donating, advocating, or volunteering. These connections will be catalyzed through a host of outreach strategies, including flyers in public spaces, implementing a robust social media campaign including a compelling LA2050 video, hosting community presentations on the issue of youth homelessness, and empowering youth to tell their own stories. Through these different interactions, Angelenos will gain deeper insight into the crisis of youth homelessness, and will in turn be motivated to support crisis housing for youth both financially and with their time, in order to make LA the best place to live."

Yet in the country that invented the Internet, nearly one in five Americans (64 million), disproportionately from low-income and minority communities, are not connected to the Internet at home, forcing them to use inconvenient public sources to access basic services. The global impact of the digital divide lies in how it compounds and deepens other social inequalities. For example, 80% of K-12 students need Internet to do homework, 90% of college applications are filled out online, and 90% of job applications are hosted online. An unemployed person who has Internet at home will be employed over seven weeks faster, due to availability of online job search platforms and advice, which translates into over $5,000 in additional income over a year.

    "goal": "CONNECT",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?​": "Central LA",
    "How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to CONNECT​": "Our sensational outreach campaigns will feature compelling messaging in English and Spanish about the dire need for loving homes for foster children. Building on our success of inclusivity, these messages will continue to target both the LBGTQ and heterosexual communities, along with further expansion into the Spanish language speaking neighborhoods throughout the city, representing approximately 48% of L.A.’s population. Additional bi-lingual staff will enable RaiseAChild to make additional inroads into the Hispanic community. We also plan to expand discussions with several inclusive and welcoming faith-based organizations to further engage Angelenos and promote our mission. Fostering and adoption are slow processes, but our goal is to motivate and engage 100,000 Angelenos through social media, targeted outreach campaigns and solid business practice technology, to help to solve the foster care crisis in Los Angeles.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​": "Our technical partners and staff will closely monitor and track the number of prospective parents who come to us through campaigns, events, websites, word of mouth, etc. and the number of prospects who have begun the necessary orientation, training and certification steps -- or where they are in the process. Using the newly-created best practice business technology, we will be able to further customize each subsequent interaction. Analyzing information from the existing pool of possible resource parents will allow us to identify the best current prospects and allocate staff resources strategically to maximize returns. As the survey and messaging results are obtained, collected, and aggregated, the information will afford staff greater efficiencies in managing its thousands of prospective parents and enable them to provide more effective one on one attention. By using this information to proactively make system-wide improvements aimed at preventing drop-out, we will be able to increase and improve our retention success rates for potential parents who in turn will ultimately be able to positively impact the safety and well-being of the children in their care.",
    "Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?": "RaiseAChild has a program that has been tested and proven unlike any in the country, which provides measured and ongoing support and guidance to all its prospective parents as they navigate the foster/adoption process. Since our inception, we have slowly introduced innovation and groundbreaking approaches into the child welfare system and are now beginning to see the positive results of our efforts. In five years, we hope to see the system completely overhauled and the process for fostering and adoption taking half the time for prospective parents to be vetted. We anticipate increasing our retention rates by an additional 40%, and the foster care crisis, now fueled in part by the opioid epidemic and new federal policies on immigration, be significantly diminished. Ultimately, we look forward to finding forever homes for 15,000 children who are the innocent victims as there is a severe shortage of foster homes in L.A. When we look at today’s children, we see tomorrow’s leaders, but for foster children to thrive in Los Angeles, we must engage Angelenos to help support their development, help build them loving families and promote public policies that work for both. In order for communities to come together cohesively to create a prosperous Los Angeles by 2050, we must invest in these children now.",
    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to CONNECT?​": "RaiseAChild’s pioneering multi-media recruitment campaigns have been steadily growing. With last year’s state-of-the-art events generating well over 1,750,000 impressions and directly reaching thousands of people, we anticipate successfully connecting with more than 100,000 Angelenos over the next two years and mobilizing them for the greater good of children in foster care. Through Activate L.A., we plan to expand by 50% the scope of these events and continue to create, produce, and manage unique outreach campaigns that promote family building to a broad spectrum of prospective families. Using radio, television, digital media, social media, and street-light banners, campaigns will be scheduled twice a year throughout Los Angeles. The spring campaign will coincide with National Foster Care Month, Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Gay Pride Month and the fall/winter campaign will take place during National Adoption Month and the holiday season. Each will prominently feature the LA2050 name on all related materials and its logo on 100 % of the street-light banners. Our innovative Parent Advocate Program, which combines the attention of a mentor with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system, will also expand to track and facilitate the progress of all identified prospective parents. Inspired by our participation in the 2017 #HackFosterCareLA event (to engage the technology sector in improving the lives of children and families involved with the foster care system), we will also embark on a unique retention collaboration designed to improved methods of communication and support services to thousands of prospective and current parents. By simultaneously developing and implementing this technology, we will have the capacity to incorporate this additional flow of prospective parents into our database, and also more effectively and efficiently meet their needs to assure their retention.",
    "Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.": "We seek to ignite true innovation within Los Angeles County's foster care system, the largest child welfare system in the nation, through a radically different approach to improve public awareness and civic engagement.

    "How will your activation mobilize Angelenos?​": "Advocate for policy",
    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to LIVE?​": "The city of Los Angeles sends over 3 million tons of waste to landfills or incinerators annually. Much of this waste could be recycled or composted if residents had sufficient access to disposal systems. Many Angelenos however lack access to recycling services in their apartments or workplaces. Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color are disproportionately affected by the unequal distribution of municipal services. Hindered access to responsible disposal systems can increase exposure to environmental hazards and health problems that emanate from poor air and water quality. Lack of access to environmental education is another contributing factor. Only 10% of the students enrolled in our youth program for example, recalled receiving environmental education in their schools. The environmental impacts for marginalized communities and gaps in environmental education are causes for significant concern. These concerns are addressed by Mar Vista Family Center’s (MVFC) Youth New A.G.E. Initiative. The Initiative aims to create a more sustainable and conscious relationship between Angelenos and the environment while introducing creative strategies for community fundraising.",

The initiative is collaborative with the potential to engage all levels of contributors: from individuals with a passion for environmentalism, to corporate sponsors seeking to develop their social responsibility efforts, to fellow youth-serving organizations looking for diversified streams of revenue or strategic partnerships.",
    "Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?": "In 5 years time we expect MVFC Youth to be recognized as leaders in the pursuit for environmental justice and equity in the city of Los Angeles, we expect to have transformed MVFC into a reliable and well-known recyclables drop-off site which includes pick-up services to ensure that vulnerable communities--like our own--have access to proper and sustainable disposal systems for recyclables including plastic, aluminum, e-waste, and paper. We expect to contribute to a small percentage of MVFC’s earned income and stimulate local job creation by hiring youth alumni to assist with waste disposal and pick-up services. We would like to see this entrepreneurial and environmentally charged model adopted by local schools and neighboring non-profits and amplification of the “Green-Giving” Model. We would expect to see an increase in environmental literacy among local residents and youth.",

Richer communities will be able to afford better access, complementary services, and local cache offsets to remote Internet and power services. Lower income communities will obtain subsidies for charitable class home installations, co-op membership, and increased access to local and remote jobs online or in local network maintenance. Home care providers in particular (who are still disproportionately women and mothers) will be recruited and trained in routine network maintenance for their local cooperative, in order to both provide them with better paying on-call jobs and prevent the high expenses of site visits and truck rolls from remote service centers. These home and hyperlocal work forces will also act as the front line of customer service and novel service studies for each neighborhood cooperative, to give them each a faster lead in customer innovation testing and scalable demand assessments.",

Thousands of new local and remote-online jobs will be created in these service areas, and millions more Angelenos will have the same or better bandwidth connections to the Internet at much lower aggregate service costs. About half these service areas will gain complementary online and local sharing logistics services in addition to greater Internet access capacity, and half of these regions will gain affordable Internet bandwidth where almost none was readily available previously."

The youth served by CASA/LA have entered the Los Angeles County juvenile dependency system because of abuse and neglect by their parents or caregivers. CASA/LA not only works to promote the permanency, safety, and well-being of youth who have experienced abuse and neglect, we are advancing justice amongst the most vulnerable young adults in the system. It is well-documented that child welfare struggles with racial, ethnic, and economic equity. A 2004 study found that in addition to being the largest system in the nation, Los Angeles County also has a disproportionate number of African American children in the system in comparison to their population size within the region. In 2016, 25% of children in DCFS were African-American (compared to 38% served by CASA). Throughout LA County, only 7.5% of all children were African-American. Over the last several years, CASA has developed specific recruitment strategies in order to better diversify our CASA volunteers. In the last year, CASA was proud to report that 36% of CASAs recruited were people of color. Through the Youth to Youth program, CASA/LA will recruit significantly more volunteers from more diverse environments to serve as peer-to-peer mentors for some of the most vulnerable youth in care.",

When a case is assigned, both the Advocate Supervisors and the CASA volunteer examine the case and rate the status and level of risk of the child on a baseline scale along the three core dimensions of safety, permanency and well being. We are documenting in the database the initial assessment related to these dimensions; the advocacy goals and plans (steps and procedures to be implemented); the degree to which the plan is then implemented; and how the assessment of safety, permanency, and well-being measures changes over time. Through ETO, we will not only be able to track who has become activated through the LA2050 program, but how their work has changed the lives of the young adults they have been appointed to serve.",

We envision a Los Angeles where all residents have high quality, clean, safe, and sustainable parks and open spaces within a ten minute walk of where they live. Play LA! is about building a sense of activism and solidarity as well as awareness of the importance of park access. More than that, it’s about getting outside, being together with your fellow Angelenos, and having fun! Through this LA2050 opportunity, we intend to harness the power of the community, stakeholders, and thought leaders to help push an interdisciplinary approach to advocacy, policy and design.

    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​": "Success is defined by the impact participating teachers have on student learning. This will be measured based upon 1) Participant Surveys: Participating teachers will complete a survey at the end of each training day and at the end of each lesson study cycle assessing training effectiveness; 2) Expert Observations & Evidence: NGSS training team members (experts) will participate in lesson study cycle as observers and will gather evidence based upon an instrument used for teacher observations by the district to evaluate performance; 3) Expert Review of Developed NGSS Lessons: Training team experts will review lesson plans developed by participating teachers for the lesson study cycles to assess quality based upon NGSS standards; 4) Consistent Attendance: Tracking attendance for all components of the training (in-person training, lesson study cycles, etc.).",
    "How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to LEARN​": "Our activation focuses on schools in LAUSD-Local District South and Compton USD. These districts were selected because implementation has been limited and because the largest achievement gaps in science among student groups are defined by race and income. LAUSD enrollment is 90% students of color and 80% are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Compton USD enrolls almost 100% students of color and 87% are socioeconomically disadvantaged.",
    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to LEARN?​": "In 2013, the California Board of Education adopted the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for K-12 public schools. Those standards were developed by 26 lead states in collaboration with key stakeholders in science, science education, higher education, and industry, based upon the new Framework for K-12 Science Education developed by the National Academy of Sciences. NGSS emphasizes “three-dimensional learning”: disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and science and engineering practices.

    "Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?": "In five years, it is the goal that the Master Chorale will have created a revenue model and the organizational staff capacity that allows for Big Sing LA to be sustainable. However, it is also a goal to craft this program with the purpose of it being replicated and self-organized by more communities at their local parks in Los Angeles, which is aligned with the metric of increasing the number of parks with inter-generational play opportunities and increase attendance at cultural events.",
    "How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to CONNECT​": "The targeted participants are adults, children, and families from diverse and eclectic backgrounds throughout Los Angeles who love to sing. Although parks are often used for concerts, these are often passive affairs—spectators & performers. Big Sing LA places the spotlight on the audience members, who are also the performers, as the conductor guides and brings it all together. These events will also activate parks as a place to play sports as well as playing music and connects people from all walks of life.",

If all of the LA-based direct service, business, parent, civil rights, community, and faith-based groups that care about young children were connected and spoke with a unified voice, there would be significant policy changes for kids in LA, and infant and toddler outcomes would dramatically improve. Children Now has already established a network of these groups through The Children’s Movement. We will engage the more 470 members in LA County in this network. Engaging groups with existing, large social media followings is a key strategy for maximizing reach to a broader audience. So, in addition, we use social media analytics to identify influencers with a strong interest in early childhood development to further our messaging.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​": "Children Now’s ultimate goal is for policymakers to take action on a unified, long-term policy plan for a comprehensive system of support for infants and toddlers.

For this project, we will measure our success by the following metrics:",
    "In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?​": "County of Los Angeles",
    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to CONNECT?​": "In the first three years of a child’s life, foundational brain architecture is established, making children’s earliest experiences the most important. The creation of healthy brain architecture is dependent on good health, positive and nurturing relationships with adults, exposure to enriching learning opportunities, and safe neighborhoods. Yet, many of LA’s babies don’t receive the supports they need for a health start.",
    "Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?": "This activation is a key component of our broader agenda to develop and sustain a comprehensive, family-centered, high quality early learning system that is accessible to all children and families, particularly those living in poverty. Public awareness and support building is a crucial piece of putting pressure on LA policymakers to make real change for young children. LA is the ideal place to be the most connected for children’s advocacy, because if the policy change is scaled here, there is no excuse for not scaling it throughout California, and, then, given California’s size and diversity, throughout the country."

UPAS will facilitate the empowerment of local communities to raise concerns and drive action related to the issues they believe are most critical to their success and well-being, including job creation, quality schools, public safety, and access to healthcare and affordable housing. UPAS, and those who graduate from its training program, will host forums for open and authentic discussions that lead to effective collaborative action on racial and economic disparities, bringing people from historically underserved neighborhoods together with elected and public officials. In the long-term, UPAS activations will generate more elected officials from places like Watts and West Athens, officials that will bring a genuinely deeper understanding of their communities’ needs and vision to institutional centers of power. These voices, supported by informed community action, will redistribute power and resources to frequently marginalized neighborhoods, eventually attracting good businesses with high paying jobs into these communities, strengthening Los Angeles by diversifying local economies and tapping into the enormous intellectual capital and drive that exists in low-income communities."

    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to LEARN?​": "Across Los Angeles, young women, particularly women of color are underrepresented in math, science, and technology. Girls typically are not found in high level math and science classes, having been discouraged early on in their educational journey. The Girls Academic Leadership Academy (GALA) aims to break this pattern by providing girls with a STEM-centered college prep curriculum in a learning environment that strongly supports girls to be smart, self confident, and successful. GALA provides leadership training and the skills necessary to persist in STEM fields. The GALA Launch Her Future focus is a project based medical and biomedical program which will focus on the intersection of medicine and technology, allowing our girls to become true leaders and innovators in this burgeoning new field. Supporting the LA2050 LEARN metric of students’ immersion in science, technology, engineering, and math content, GALA is requesting support not just in STEM but in the newest field within STEM, including project based medical and technological innovation. GALA aims to encouraging learning and growth in this field by investigating medical mysteries, and using technology to solve them, which will advance the goal of 100% graduation and 100% college matriculation. In studying medical inventions, technological and biomedical innovation, students will work with the same equipment and tools used by professionals in the field. GALA students will be empowered to explore and find solutions to some of today’s most pressing medical challenges. Through activities that connect learning to life, students will step into the roles of biomedical science professionals investigating such topics as use of technology in medicine, genetics and issues in public health. Students will work together in teams to explore problems and find unique solutions, learning in-demand, transferable skills. One of the student inspired goals is health care advocacy and accessibility for Los Angelenos in need especially focusing in on homeless women. Our students hope to one day create an app or digital website that could be used to connect these women to health resources. This connects to the LA is the Healthiest place to LIVE part of LA2050 in that the girls long term goal is to affect greater change through access to medicine in the city. With access to the curriculum and resources, GALA students can explore public health issues such as how to detect and fight infection; screen and evaluate for disease and treatment options; and develop technology to support their findings. Through real-world cases, students will be exposed to a range of interventions, diagnostics, and devices related to immunology, surgery, genetics, and pharmacology. GALA’s mission is to provide its diverse community of young women with an excellent STEM education that prepares them for success in both university studies and their careers. The Launch Her Future biomedical technology project will do just that.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​": "GALA offers students a rigorous college preparatory curriculum in all grades, and the opportunity to earn college credit through Advanced Placement Testing beginning in ninth grade, with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of women in Los Angeles opting for careers in STEM fields. The immediate measurement of success will be incorporating a biomedical strand to our STEM curriculum, building interest in the medical field and encouraging leadership through a project based integrated curriculum focusing in the biomedical sciences. Currently, our 9th grade girls are researching STEM based medical professions and completing a project predicting what the future women will look, act and evolve into. A measure of success we anticipate is increasing the interest in STEM fields and supporting more young women in pursuing their dreams of becoming doctor, medical investigators, and innovators in the medical field. The long term measurement of success will come in 2020, when we graduate our first class and all young women are accepted into a four-year universities. GALA students will learn the techniques the students in college are already learning. They will be that far ahead by combining their technological knowledge and understanding of medical issues to become the future leaders finding solutions to public health issues.",

Skills like self-control, resilience, teamwork and a growth mindset have particular importance for kids that grow up in low-income urban communities. We believe that with intentional program design and talented coaches, the sport itself and its complementary academic support provide the perfect context to teach these skills. This model transcends a typical after-school sports program by providing wrap-around programming in a safe, structured, year-round environment that is centered on immersive academic and sport-based learning. We know that the sport is naturally engaging for all kids and we are hopeful that together, with LA2050, Harlem Lacrosse — Los Angeles can continue to deepen our impact and provide the kinds of experiences that are truly life-changing to even more young people in our community, intergenerational families, and the community at large.",

Coupled with The Human Element (https://thehumanelement.com) this program would not otherwise be accessible to this population due to the prohibitive costs. As a certified practitioner in both practices, Leili Eghbal along with the MAPPS team will be responsible for the delivery of these trainings not only at HSRA but at other partner organizations such as the YWCAGLA, The Anti Recidivism Coalition, and Dignity Health among others. We believe we can affect district wide graduation rates because HSRA's current model attracts drop-outs, meaning that all those kids now have a real shot at a high school diploma. We want the kids that no one else wants. HSRA boasts a 100% college acceptance for graduates. In addition, MAPPS which will be part of the curriculum, is a choice-based approach to career exploration and planning unlike any these kids will ever be exposed to. Organizations across the globe have used this methodology with impressive results among various populations.

    "In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?​": "Central LA",
    "Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place to LIVE?​": "UCLA Center for Health Services and Society collaborated with Healthy African American Families to develop B-RESILIENT, a resiliency-based mobile intervention for depression self-management using the Community-Partnered Participatory Approach to enhance mental health quality of life and to help improve patient engagement and outcomes for individuals living with mild to moderate depression. The B-RESILIENT texting intervention was born out of community and patient partners’ requests to increase the availability of coping resources used in Building Resiliency in Communities for Health (B-RICH)--a manualized, 7-week class led by lay health workers to introduce CBT concepts--that emerged as a key innovation in Community Partners in Care (CPIC). Consistent with tracking and building on community input and engagement in interventions, the present study uses the same community engagement approach to expand access and availability to core coping and symptom self-management resources as well as information on and encouragement to receive needed services, through a mobile platform (Chorus). Our B-RESILIENT intervention introduces and reinforces principles of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in order to support personal resiliency and reduce the risk for and impact of depressive symptoms and promote symptom self-management in response to multiple stressors in under-resourced communities of color. This app is a 30 day program where users will receive daily affirmations to start off their day and education on how to improve their mood (\"boost\"), reward themselves/enjoy activities (\"break\") and how to ask for support (\"buddy\") through interactive texts. After the 30 days, a user can convert to the mobile app to refer to as a guide if still needed. We then created a mobile web application in which participants followed-up on their experience with B-RESILIENT through surveys and also monitored their depression over one month to see the impact the B-RESILIENT app had. For this new iteration, we would like to expand the app to include content 7 days a week for one month instead of just doing the week. We would also like to make this app accessible to more populations in Los Angeles, especially under-resourced communities (ages 18 and over), in improving the mental health of more communities and how a person can better manage depressive symptoms. We would also like to add more features, such as creating professional videos to complement the text messages and provide more encouragement. We plan to add interactive features, such as fun games as a way to provide \"breaks\" and a simple distraction, daily mood ratings and tips for boosting low moods, and activity schedules. The previous piloting of the app made a positive impact on users, especially the daily affirmations and our biggest feedback was that users wanted more content.",
    "How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to LIVE​": "A healthier LA is a happier LA. Individuals living with depression have been presented with many barriers, from lack of resources, access to care (psychiatrists/therapists) to the cost of medications and therapy along with the uncertainty of their effectiveness, not to mention the time it takes to find the right therapist and medication. One of the biggest challenges, though, is fighting through the stigma and getting the support from family and friends to aid in the recovery. It is this challenge that makes it difficult to get help and treatment. We want to change this with the B-RESILIENT app. We have spent many years working with under-resourced communities and improving depression care in those communities, specifically South Los Angeles and the Hollywood Metro area. After the success of our Community Partners in Care study where we worked with over 95 agencies in the community and gained the trust of the community, we used this expertise in developing the B-RESILIENT texting app which we have piloted twice to positive results which included positive reinforcement for those experiencing low moods, educated clients on resources available for depression, provided mentorship on how to reach out to family and friends for support (“Do You Need a Buddy?”), and encouraged clients to reward themselves with pleasurable activities and breaks. We believe this app will continue to make an impact on more populations and communities in Los Angeles.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​": "Success will be measured through data obtained through using the App on: 1) number of users; 2) frequency of use and of interactions with specific features; 3) a measure of how people are doing on days of use; 4) a daily mood measure on days of use. Independent of use of the App, we will also field monthly brief mental wellness measures such as a three-item measure from prior studies (Wells et al., 2013). We will track how many users are \"core\" and use the App at least 5-6 times and how many are familiar with the App (used at least once) to be a resource for future needs. In addition, for the adapter work group, we will have more extensive measures of user feasibility, accessibility and effectiveness. We will also examine feasibility on first use of brief demographic measures that maintain confidentiality (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity) to allow review of uptake, reach, response and effectiveness for different demographic groups. In addition, we will track the number of people who visit the webpage about the overall project to understand basic awareness of the program.",

    "How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to LIVE​": "Creative Reuse Coalition workshops will be open to the public and will take place in 6-8 different locations across LA to attract a variety of participants. Workshop locations will be chosen based on the following criteria to ensure accessibility and diversity: 1) proximity to public transit; 2) location in or near highly frequented centers; 3) location near diverse communities to ensure participants of various backgrounds and financial means. The activation will engage up to 240 Los Angeles residents through free public workshops featuring local artists, artisans, technicians, chefs, celebrities, social influencers, makers, menders, etc. The workshops will give attendees a hands-on experience and the skills/knowledge that they need to repair items in their everyday lives. In addition, Global Green will engage community members after the workshop by developing and posting video guides and blogs following each workshop to educate those who could not attend workshops and to further educate/increase skill levels for participants. The ease of accessing and sharing these free videos and guides will increase program accessibility for all and provide an opportunity to engage more Angelenos. Based on current levels of viewership on Global Green’s Youtube channel, we anticipate 1200-1600 people will watch these videos. Post-workshop surveys will be administered, so that participants can provide feedback to ensure that we are progressing towards making LA the best place to live.",

Therefore, in five years, we hope that our workshops inspire Angelenos in every neighborhood to repair and reuse their broken, worn out, or damaged belongings rather than throwing them out, and to share those lessons with others, making reuse the first instinct before disposal. We hope that our model workshops may inspire regular repair cafes in a variety of areas around the city, as well as increase the frequency of events, focus, education, and policies on repair and reuse strategies for waste prevention. In time, we hope that with more interest and enthusiasm for reusing and repairing old items, the City of LA will be a model city for waste diversion, with the incorporation of strategies encouraging repair and reuse as key approaches to meet diversion goals in its updates to the City’s Sustainability Plan.",

We aim to educate up to 240 Angelenos in these workshops to empower them to “upcycle”, creating a cycle of reusing and repairing items that would otherwise go to landfill. During the workshops, residents will learn how to transform their unwanted, worn out, or damaged items into “new” or improved materials, creating a space for creative reuse and waste prevention in the City of LA. Each workshop will focus on a specific need (i.e. textile mending) based on pre-surveys provided by Global Green to participants, and will include the tools and resources required for residents to reinvent ‘wasted’ items to create greener, more resilient communities. In addition to providing its own expertise for these workshops, Global Green will invite local, relevant experts to lead each workshop and provide one-on-one assistance to attendees."

In Los Angeles County, 57,794 people experienced homelessness on a given night in 2017. Of this number, over 17,000 are women and nearly 500 are transgender. The average homeless female in Los Angeles County is a woman of color and is of reproductive age. Most of these women and girls will menstruate each month, which is a natural part of the reproductive system, yet it remains taboo. As a result, the challenges of menstrual hygiene are heightened due to the socioeconomic status of these women. A 3 foot high, 25-foot art installation of the words PERIODS and #HAPPYPERIOD set in five locations within Los Angeles county. The letters will be made of recycled materials with bins built in the back of each letter. The front of the letters will to be filled with packages of period products. The back bins will be made to also be filled with donations. The public will be encouraged to take photos with the installation and donate their unwanted disposable or reusable products for a homeless passer-by to take for themselves or someone else in need. #HappyPeriod will be able to refurbish and collect donations for shelters.

It is the transformative power of bridged social capital that gets families to better solutions faster, and in the process build stronger communities. In fact, at LIFT we’ve actually proven it works by tracking growth in our members’ social capital and comparing it to their progress against economic outcomes and found an undeniable correlation between the two. In short, the more social capital you have, the more likely it is you achieve your goals.

But they also likely think of the traffic and the smog, and their effects on our environment and our kids. It’s true that in our state, emissions from our transportation system accounts for a majority of the emissions that lead to climate change, and dirty air days are on the rise for the last three years running. These impacts are magnified on our city’s kids, leading to an astounding million days of missed school for kids suffering from respiratory problems, who travel to and from school on polluting school buses powered by dirty energy we don’t need. It shouldn’t be this way. Through intentional policies, we have the power to end this problem and create a more livable, breathable, and greener city for all—most importantly for our youngest residents—while creating pathways into good, clean manufacturing jobs for youth and underserved communities.",

However, top-down resilience-building initiatives marginalize the voices of the most vulnerable among us, and inclusive resilience-building initiatives bank on the participation of people who are already overwhelmed and under-resourced. The organizations that provide the services, education, and support to these vulnerable populations are the backbone of LA’s human safety care net. These are the groups that do gang prevention/intervention, wraparound services to youth in foster care and probation systems, legal and educational services for undocumented immigrants, primary health and dental care to low-income people, and supportive housing for those without homes. Their front-line staff, organizers, and volunteers often share some of the same vulnerabilities of the people they serve, and the work itself is challenging and draining. Although it is well known that vicarious trauma and significant burnout are commonplace, funding challenges prevent organizations from providing the support their people need to make programs and initiatives effective and sustainable. If the people supporting the community are stumbling under the weight of their work, the community itself suffers and does not have the bandwidth to engage with large-scale change efforts. To activate community level resilience, we need to take a foundational step; we need to grow the resilience of the people on the front lines of the safety net. By resourcing and connecting the professionals, peer specialists, and community members, the people who are needed to make systems change will have the needed social-emotional support and actually be change-ready.",

By 2019, we plan to have 50,000 Angelenos using the platform. By 2020, we anticipate that number climbing to 100,000 users. Increased community engagement will be measured by analyzing the number of individuals who are registering for, attending, and being waitlisted for our community training workshops. By 2019, we plan to reach 1,000 Angelenos through these trainings. By 2020, we plan to reach 2,000 participants. We will also record how much platform-related feedback we receive from the community, and how often individuals are downloading data and/or creating a login with the platform. Additionally, we will track inquiries from community groups requesting collaborations on data stories, as well the number of community partnerships to support NDSC training workshops.

Since the platform launched in October 2017, the platform has been viewed over 30,000 times. NDSC will scale up current activities to reach a total of 100,000 Angelenos over the next two years. Working with a range of community organizations, we will increase the number of trainings within LA County neighborhoods, to ensure that all Angelenos are able to locate the neighborhood data needed to activate change within their communities. NDSC will strategically partner with Neighborhood Councils, ensuring that we reach the full diversity of neighborhoods across the region — big and small, urban and rural, wealthy and under-resourced. A webinar will also be created to reach people that cannot attend a training. Training content will be promoted on the NDSC platform, in a monthly newsletter, and on the NDSC Twitter handle, which shares training schedules, new datasets and new data stories. Lastly, additional outreach will be conducted to engage more community partners in co-developing biweekly data stories published in partnership with KCETLink. Through these strategies, NDSC will provide a ladder of local data engagement for all Angelenos — from attending a single community training to participating as a full partner on new data stories.",
    "Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?": "In five years, Angelenos from all neighborhoods, with different backgrounds, goals, and aspirations for their neighborhoods, will use NDSC to activate change within their community. Civic actors will recognize NDSC as the go-to resource for accurate, timely, and policy relevant information about the challenges, opportunities, and trends facing local neighborhoods. Civic actors will have the information needed to generate informed and evidence-based policies and programs that address the unique needs of their communities. And, they will have a platform to share stories relevant to their community, using NDSC data stories to voice their opinions, influence policymakers, and advocate for their needs. NDSC will remain free to all users retaining its commitment to democratizing data; NDSC is the byproduct of a community-owned vision for accessible, transparent neighborhood data, and it is the community that will continue to shape the evolution of the platform. By working directly in partnership with nonprofit organizations, businesses, advocacy groups, neighborhood councils, and other civic actors, NDSC will activate a new era of civic engagement in Los Angeles, helping Angelenos build and track progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles."
