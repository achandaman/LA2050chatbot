    "yearSubmitted": "2020",
    "organization": "Malibu Foundation",
    "summary": "We aim to establish an annual summer surf camp for children experiencing residual trauma from the fire and children with developmental or physical disabilities. The 4-week long camp serves as surf therapy, allowing children to grow in their confidence and seek recovery from trauma. The camp will feature a final day showcasing environmental efforts to protect the beaches and ocean that makes this opportunity so special.",

    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this proposal?​": "Direct Impact: 200",
    "Which of the PLAY metrics will your submission impact?​": "Youth sports participation",
    "Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?​": "LA is the best place to CONNECT",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project?": "Expand existing program",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "Last year we supported 120 kids through our 4-week camp. We received 100% positive feedback and many requests for an extension. We presented participants with pre and post-camp surveys and analyzed those results. Last summer, children, on average, reported an 83.3% decline in fear (metric on a scale of 1-10; instructors walked kids through the meaning of each #). Children, on average, also reported feeling 66.7% more confident in themselves and their abilities. Both children and their parents reported leaving the camp with a high level of enthusiasm, and a new therapeutic outlet.",
    "Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?​": "Access to the LA2050 community",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Westside",
    "If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.": "We are not submitting a collaborative proposal per se but we do have partners lined up to help us should we receive funding. We will hire surf instructors from Mighty Underdogs to administer the surf teaching. We will also hire a consultant from Roots & Wings to administer the program communication training at the beginning of the summer. Lifeguards and CPR trainers will be hired through LA County.",
    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "Originally we started Endless Summer Surf Camp (2019) in response to the trauma inflicted upon our youth by the Woolsey Fire of 2018. We wanted to find a way for kids to connect with nature in a positive and healing manner, while providing a nurturing environment during the out-of-school summer months. The surf teachers who we work with specialize in teaching kids with autism and other special needs. We saw the benefits of their surf therapy for these children and sought to expand it to all who might need a boost of confidence and nature therapy.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "Our goal as an organization is to create a resilient Malibu. Part of this resiliency comes in promoting the wellbeing of Malibu’s children. Many children suffered from the Woolsey Fire and may continue to experience the negative effects of this trauma, on top of current fears with the coronavirus pandemic.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "The ocean stimulates our physical, mental, spiritual, social and emotional well being. We bring the skill and build the necessary trust and then let the ocean do the rest. With this program, we hope to help children discover that they can achieve anything, including overcoming traumatic experiences. Helping children overcome adverse childhood experiences and trauma reduces the likelihood that these effects will carry over into adulthood. By inspiring this confidence in children, we hope they will not only find an easier road to trauma recovery but also gain confidence in their abilities as stewards of the environment. We hope to encourage a positive relationship with nature and spur our youth to action in protecting our oceans."

    "summary": "Through a major expansion of our in-school program, Inner-City Arts will help close the equity and access gap on arts education for LAUSD students. With the expansive of digital platforms and tools now available (and recent integration of virtual learning on a wide-scale due to COVID-19), we will combine 30 years of hands-on experience with new virtual tools, to bring the highest caliber of sequential, curriculum-based arts education to the broadest segment of LAUSD’s least resourced classrooms, educators, and communities.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "Our project’s intended population are students at Title 1 schools, prioritizing partners based on current access to arts instruction (using LAUSD’s Arts Equity Index). The broader impact of our proposal is that we go from serving typically 5,500+ primarily low-income students and their teachers each year, to transforming hundreds more classrooms across our city, with the potential to reach thousands more students (as indicated by rough estimates listed above). This means also supporting more educators with training in arts integration to support whole-school, systemic change in underserved communities on a scale never before possible.

    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "Inner-City Arts has been partnering with LAUSD for three decades, and we have extensive in-depth relationships with LAUSD teachers, administrators – we even have a long-standing friendship with the bus drivers’ union. At every level, we are experts in navigating LAUSD’s multitude of complexities.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "For us, project success is clearly measurable using the following questions – Are we significantly increasing the percentage of LAUSD students receiving arts education as part of their school day? Is the programming in which students are participating comprehensive and of the highest quality? Are educators reporting positive impact of participation, as evidenced by improvements in students’ academic outcomes, and Social Emotional Learning outcomes? We will answer these questions by methodically collecting quantitative and qualitative data, pre- and post-participant surveys, and classroom observation."

We want LA to be a great place to live with clean air, fair wages, and the health and prosperity of citizens considered above all. If this means peaceful actions, art projects, social gatherings, or interviewing climate change leaders on our podcast, we'll make it happen.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "The ultimate measure of success would be collaborating with residents and other organizations to stop neighborhood drilling in LA, protect the environment, and move toward a clean energy future. On a mission-based level, this would include growing our mailing list and social following, growing attendance at SoCal 350 meetings and creating a true sense of community that inspires and motivates on-going action, creating on-going partnerships with youth groups and like-minded activists, and being able to inform, educate, and mobilize the community in a way that puts pressure on government leaders to shut down neighborhood drill sites.",

These are just some of the issues that bounce around in the collective brain of SoCal 350 members. We're responding to a need throughout our community for information. We want to inspire and motivate residents to show their concern and raise their voices in hopes of enacting true change. We exist because we see the social, environmental, and economic issues facing the LA area and we want to do what we can to make things right. As a coalition, we partner with other organizations to spread the word, but with increased financial means we can create a name for ourselves and improve our ability to work with others, and spread information in an easy to understand and peaceful way.

    "Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?": "Lost Angels Children’s Project (LACP) is honored to be an LA2050 Grants Challenge finalist. While our programs are designed to create opportunities for youth and young adults, we remain flexible to the communities we serve and are always ready to meet emerging needs. The COVID-19 crisis has altered the way we do business right now but our mission stays the same to improve the lives of vulnerable youth—particularly those affected by the child welfare and/or juvenile justice systems. In April 2020, we began a campaign for hunger relief, knowing that most of the families we serve experience food insecurity. We created t-shirts for charity, started fundraising online, and worked with local partners to secure healthy meals in ready to eat containers for distribution. The program has increased from 300 meals per week and 50 families, to currently 2000 meals per week and over 200 families. Recognizing the dire need for basic supplies in our nearby mobile home communities, we also found resources to purchase essential goods such as toilet paper, soap, baby wipes, detergent, sanitizer, masks, and more. On hot days we hand out popsicles, and also purchased toys, games and activities for our students and the neighborhood children who are staying “safer at home.” We will continue on this path for as long as needed; however, we expect to soon start back up with our social enterprise program for opportunity youth ages 18-24. In the next phase of CA reopening, we hope we can bring back our cohort of 10 students who are learning the Industrial Arts through Good Life Mfg. It is possible to social distance in the Lost Angels Children’s Project Industrial Arts Youth Center and we are confident our students will stay safe with proper PPE.",

    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "A 2019 article in the Journal of General Internal Medicine estimates 11% of young adults nationally are food insecure. A 2017 report from The Urban Institute estimated 11% of households with a 4-year college student experienced food insecurity. That figure is 17% when including a community college student. A 2019 study of 40,000 California community college students shared that half of respondents were food insecure in the prior 30 days. Food insecurity is characterized by disrupted eating patterns and reduced quality and quantity of diets. Hunger has deep physical, emotional, and academic effects, exacerbating health problems and derailing academic progress. The problem often goes unnoticed, and the stigma around being unable to meet basic needs keeps people from seeking help. Having already developed and proven a model to drive Medi-Cal uptake among young adults of color in LA, YI seeks the resources to expand the scope of our outreach to encompass both health care and nutrition.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "YI assesses the impact of our activities through tracking the number of beneficiaries reached, along with overall evidence of effective communication and benefit uptake among target demographics. Consistent with YI’s previous successful model, YI will track individual participation in programming, and will work with LA DPSS to track sign-ups for eligible benefits. Our state-based work concentrates on digital engagement, resource development, in-person engagement, and coalition partnership. We simultaneously recognize that elevating awareness of a program availability is valuable, as well as the number enrolled. We track the number of people to whom we provide information and capture stories of their experiences. By the end of the grant year, 1000 Californians, primarily those newly eligible for health care, will have received education about their health care coverage options and enrollment opportunities. Typically, each person directly impacted by our program reports having shared information and resources with 3 others.

We will expand this model to include Cal-Fresh outreach. Young adults in YI’s programs launched an advocacy campaign to expand SNAP benefits for college students by increasing access to CalFresh benefits. In 2019, YI successfully launched the 2nd year of our #HealthyAdulting campaign micro-targeting Black and Latinx young men for health care literacy and Medi-Cal enrollments. YI led a preventive care conversation with young adults and community members. We developed strategic partnerships with the LA Co.

Union Station therefore seeks to expand the program to engage more participants and volunteers. Through our position as Lead Agency of the Coordinated Entry System for Families and for Individuals in Service Planning Area 3, and our successful record of adopting cutting-edge approaches, we are well-positioned to further advance the Community Allies Program across the San Gabriel Valley.",

At this time, we are prioritizing the safety of our volunteers and participants by cancelling all in-person activities until further notice. We have adapted programming and expanded opportunities for connection through new pilot initiatives such as “Phone Pals,” in which new friendships are facilitated over the phone. This offering has been especially impactful for Project Roomkey residents, who are highly vulnerable people experiencing homelessness who have been sheltered in motel rooms, and are thus extremely isolated.",

In fact, 70% of teens with chronic pain will have persistent pain as adults if not properly addressed during adolescence. Health issues extend to family members. Parenting a child with chronic pain can result in missed work, financial stress, poor self-care, and mental health issues. The negative impact of pediatric chronic pain has been established, but there are still many barriers like socioeconomic status, location, insurance, and transportation. chyp utilizes the current tech-focused climate to provide resources online, so families can get the help they need in their own homes.

The portfolio at the end will spread awareness of pediatric chronic pain and creative healing.

Through six group cycles (12 participants/group) there will be two groups aged 13-17, two groups aged 18-25, and two groups for parents. An initial Zoom meeting will discuss expectations, followed by two weeks to take photos. Each cycle will end with a Zoom meeting to share photos and process with peers, led by mental health professionals. To measure success there will be a pre- and post-test. Outcomes will be based on quantitative rating scales and qualitative interviews: 1. To what extent do you feel you expressed your pain and/or coping to others? 2. To what extent do you feel connected to others? and 3. Percent of program completion. Questions 1 and 2 will have a 0-10 scale (0/not at all - 10/extremely), and will be considered successful if the mean change of the age grouping’s pre- and post-score increases by at least two points.

Given that most youth are unwilling to seek therapeutic interventions due to time, location or cost as well as stigma, JBBBSLA determined that using technology in the form of a mobile app to provide social and emotional support would be the most effective way to deliver these vital services.

JBBBSLA’s vision: 1) Hundreds of Los Angeles teens are trained to become teen advisors. The teen advisors report great satisfaction helping other teens in need of social and emotional support and additionally, they experience increased involvement in their own communities. 2) Tens of thousands of teens in need have access to social and emotional support from peers who can relate to them.

In so doing, we co-curate the best possible conditions towards such self-possessed autonomy. How can we reimagine safe spaces that also cultivate liberating opportunities for self-reclamation? Homeownership and entrepreneurship are proven promotive and protective factors that help people reinvent their lives while building self-esteem, especially since there is much data on the relationship between low self-esteem and unwanted health outcomes. Survivors thrive in spaces that are removed from the immediacy of the environments they seek to escape.

In LAUSD, for example, 80%+ of students are eligible for free/reduced-fee meals, a strong indicator of the socio-economic realities that students and their families face. When buying groceries is a challenge, obtaining an instrument or getting lessons outside of school is almost impossible. Additionally, 70%+ of the student population is Latino/Hispanic, meaning many young people may choose not to participate in traditional music programs as they do not reflect their likes and diverse cultural perspectives. The need then is two-fold: music education must be both accessible and relevant to be effective. At a time when the benefits of music education are better understood than ever before, LKR is improving participation and inspiring young people to unlock their inner music-makers with profound results including enhanced emotional literacy, improved attendance, and increased engagement in the school community."

And yet, the pain of the prison system for those left behind remains invisible. The children impacted by incarceration are disproportionately more likely to have higher dropout rates and higher incidences of depression and anxiety. As a result, they face greater challenges in school. They need a vehicle by which to navigate the minefield of their pain and loss.",

Her passion to reduce the traumatic impact of incarceration on youth led her in 2012 to co-found POPS at Venice HS with her second husband, Dennis Danziger, a veteran high school English teacher.

Family members of these individuals, children in particular, also serve a “silent sentence” deal with a range of emotions – fear, anger, anxiety, shame, and confusion. This diminished self-esteem robs both justice-involved individuals and their loved ones of social opportunities, causing them to withdraw from their community. Both POPS and Defy work to shift the mindsets of justice-involved individuals and their loved ones to heal and reframe the stigma about incarceration.

With a positive outlook toward future learning experiences, the goal is that youth seek to complete their education, a critical factor for reentry and reducing recidivism rates for juvenile offenders.",
    "Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?​": "Access to the LA2050 community",
    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "According to a report from the Children’s Defense Fund – California published in December, 2019, Los Angeles County is home to the largest probation department in the world and maintains one of the highest rates of youth incarceration in the nation. Justice-involved youth often have an array of identities and needs, yet are less likely than others to access the tools and skills critical for their success as they return to their community and prepare to enter adulthood. As a result, many of them do not successfully complete their probation, do not complete their education, develop mental health issues, engage in substance abuse, struggle with unemployment, and have a high recidivism rate. JGD-USA understands that arts programs are a critical intervention that address trauma for youth who are incarcerated, and a foundational strategy for successful reentry.",

In addition to the numerous children and adults in the 750,000 households we will contact, EITCs also have a multiplier effect—every dollar generates $1.50-$2 in local economic activity. Stimulus funds have similar effects, so helping low-income Angelenos file their taxes eventually helps ALL people in LA County."

I founded Parent Revolution and passed California's parent trigger law to empower low income parents at the grassroots level to advocate for the interests of their children. I helped launch the Vergara civil rights litigation to establish constitutional rights for low income children and children of color via impact litigation. And I've been organizing around this theory of change for the past 4 years. Kids Coalition exists specifically to reorient the incentive structures of public education to serve the interests of students. Kids Coalition can't do this alone.

HL-LA provides all participants with their first experience in lacrosse - often their first experience with any sport. The student-athletes who comprise HL-LA’s programs are asked to overcome obstacles like poverty, housing and food insecurity, and trauma with fewer programs and tools at their disposal than their more affluent peers.

Exposing more people to groups and individuals who carry and practice this knowledge would contribute to an awareness, understanding and appreciation of other restorative ways. This work is an opportunity to connect individuals and our larger LA community to their own indigenous traditions that have been disrupted by a history of colonization while reminding all people of their shared humanity and diversity as expressed in indigenous practices.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "Our practice is rooted in the recognition of the indigenous mindset. This project embodies our lived mission of honoring ancestral knowledge and delves into the rich history that is the source of today’s expressions of ancestral practices. For 18 years we have provided access to cultural traditions such as Danza Mexica and Mexicayotl workshops, addressing teachings in Nahuatl language, Mexica calendar, and more. We are connected with the local Fernandeno Tataviam tribe & its nonprofit Pukuu in ongoing collaboration & cultural sharing. Pukuu has been operating since the 1970’s in community reinvestment & cultural wellness. This project is a way to fully partner in sharing knowledge of our traditions and customs.

Continuing this project bridges the community to “ancestral literacy” by means of workshops, ceremonies, and a final wellness culmination to learn, reflect, and share indigenous-based history, lessons, skills and practices. Our vision for success is to engage Northeast San Fernando residents, the majority who originate from Mexico, Central America, and are of Native American decent, to share dialogue, co-learn self-care skills and history rooted in ancestral and indigenous knowledge relevant to them by hosting workshops throughout the project period at our community centers. The outcome of workshops is to prepare participants to put the lessons into action in their daily lives. To evaluate and measure this each workshop will include a brief survey to gauge the participant’s experience. The anonymous surveys will address questions of facilitation, content, personal experience, likelihood of implementation and ask how they heard about the workshop.

    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "OneJustice advances the impact of the legal services delivery system by building the capacity of the legal aid nonprofits that comprise the system through the use of pro bono private sector resources. As a statewide support center for legal services organizations, we work with partner organizations to build up their capacity by training and mobilizing volunteer attorneys and law students to provide pro bono legal services to people throughout California who have limited access to legal help due to systemic, regional, and economic barriers. OneJustice partners with law firms, law schools, corporations, and legal services organizations to implement free legal clinics in rural and isolated communities throughout California in order to connect communities with free, high-quality legal services. Since 2009, OneJustice’s pro bono program has engaged over 2,000 pro bono volunteers, implemented over 190 immigration clinics, and provided legal assistance to over 3,500 immigrants.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "LA’s immigration legal services nonprofits cannot currently meet the growing legal needs of asylum seekers in LA. With this grant, our collaborative hopes to implement a strong infrastructure of regular volunteers and expand access to justice by ensuring that all individuals and families seeking asylum in LA who cannot afford an attorney are equipped to meaningfully represent themselves in immigration court with correctly filled out asylum applications. In the short-term, our goal is to implement quarterly large-scale virtual or in-person Asylum Legal Clinics and Resource Fairs to respond to the immediate needs of pro se asylum seekers who have upcoming immigration court cases in Los Angeles and connect them to legal, mental health, medical, and comunity services and resources. We will track the following quantitative metrics to help us gauge our success: the number of trained volunteers; the number of asylum seekers provided legal and social services; the number of asylum applications completed and reviewed by a supervising attorney; the number of social services organizations and City departments engaged as partners.",
    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "The US asylum system is being dismantled by the Trump administration through dangerous and immoral policies such as family separations, metering, the asylum ban, and the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the “Remain in Mexico” policy. The administration has created insurmountable barriers for refugees trying to access our asylum system. In the past years, we have seen an increasing number of non-detained asylum seekers in need of representation and legal guidance. In Los Angeles, over 100,000 individuals in removal proceedings do not have access to legal counsel and therefore face violations in due process procedures. We know that with legal defense individuals’ success rate in court increases 5x. Unfortunately, there is a lack of capacity among pro-bono legal service providers. To address this unmet need in Los Angeles we activated our network, bringing together legal service providers and private attorneys to increase access to legal services for asylum seekers.",

    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "Asylum application clinics are part of a national effort to ensure unrepresented asylum seekers have access to due process. In FY 2019, unrepresented asylum seekers had an 84% denial rate at their immigration court hearings in LA. As the number of asylum seekers in need of support to navigate procedural intricacies exponentially increases, trained volunteers supervised by experienced attorneys give asylum seekers a better chance of winning their cases. Until we have publicly funded universal legal representation to ensure asylum seekers have their fair day in court, efficient pro bono services can build capacity. Mobilizing volunteers and law students exponentially increases access to legal assistance for asylum seekers and their families."

As an organization our primary focus historically and currently has been to provide services to high risk and underserved communities. Heart Sessions workshop has now been serving the Central Long Beach community since 2009, servicing high-risk youth between the ages of 14-24. Open Mic Sessions has been offering community programming for 20 years within all of Los Angeles County & City of LA. The curriculum has been refined over the course of this time with coarse material and workbooks now available. LA Aims 4 the Heart exponentially grows our organization’s efforts by making the curriculum available digitally and to targeted Los Angeles neighborhoods.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "Our program brings an arts and emotional literacy program to the fingertips of Angelenos through online and mobile accessibility. That digital experience grows into live connection. It's important, especially in this climate, to give our youth access to these tools at home to guide them through this experience. Expression through art will help create a future population of Angelenos that are more emotionally intelligent. The program unites Angelenos around shared core values, experiences, and expression. Making this knowledge accessible assists in relieving the angst that many of us are feeling and will have a positive impact on our mental health as we move through these uncertain times."

    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "There’s a constant refrain in cities that it's difficult to make friends and connect with people as adults. Friendships made through school, work, and physical proximity can be limiting in scope and create bubbles. Sports is a proven outlet for folks of all ages to connect with each other. Teamwork and competition can create intense bonds. Curling is a particularly unique sport in that it is available to anyone who wants to play. There are very few limitations as the game isn’t about pure strength, size isn’t a determining factor, and folks can participate from wheelchairs, deaf, or even blind. Women can compete with men and families can play together. It is through this lens that curling can help connect disparate groups who otherwise would have no reason to meet in a collaborative setting. Lawyers and artists, bureaucrats and scientists, children and retirees. If you’re new to a city, you can go to a curling club and instantly find a welcoming group of folks to make you feel at home.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "The broader impact of this proposal is to highlight the value of sports, competition, and physical activity in a highly urbanized world. It is very difficult to create new park space, so we have an opportunity to create recreation opportunities indoors for a sport that has a very low barrier to access. The fact that the sport is open to all means participants represent such a broad spectrum of Angelenos and bringing different groups together for a common activity is a first step to bridging many of the social gaps we find ourselves with. While total number of people we reach will be in the hundreds, not thousands, the effect will be more impactful for those we do reach.",

There is also a dramatic need for data around indoor air & local water quality, especially in multi-family buildings in DACs to build the case to channel funding to these communities. Greater evidence links poorly constructed, maintained & located housing to many health conditions, including asthma, lead poisoning & mental health issues, as well as more ER visits & hospitalizations. Healthier buildings focus more on energy efficiency & water conservation, lowering utility bills. Families who struggle to make rent, move frequently or experience homelessness, face a much greater risk of adverse health outcomes.",

Over the years, the SLM has emerged as 2BCF's most popular program. Since 2015, 2BCF has provided 173 STEAM Lab Makerspaces to PreK-12 schools throughout Los Angeles and Orange Counties, as well as two in Tennessee. These unique educational spaces come with upcycled materials, a range of tools, and original, innovative PBL-based curriculum that is both grade-specific and aligned with State-approved STEAM-related standards. Through its SLM program, 2BCF has introduced over 200,000 preK-12 students, well over half of them from diverse, low/moderate income families, to STEAM/STEM.",
    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "There are sustained, documented inequities in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM) education throughout the US. Minorities and economically disadvantaged students are less prepared in STEAM coursework, leaving them less informed about science and technology, less prepared for the workforce, more likely to wind up with lower social and economic mobility, and experience a diminished quality of life. This “under educating” of a substantial number of local students negatively impacts LA's viability as a strong employment market. According to US Dept. of Labor, over 50% of today's jobs require some degree of technology skills, which experts say will increase to 77% in the next decade. Yet, LA has the nation's 5th largest job skills gap, primarily in technology. For disadvantaged students preparing for the future, SLMs level the playing field by providing the space and resources with which to learn, innovate, experiment and build employable skills.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "SLMs provide STEM/STEAM resources for preK-12 students as they prepare for future education and an increasingly tech-heavy workplace. This is particularly critical for the nearly 500,000 non-white LAUSD students who live at or below the poverty line, and, for the most part, attend under-served schools. Without outside active support, these schools struggle to provide educational resources for their STEM/STEAM classes and professional development for their teachers. A solid STEM education that fosters critical thinking and creativity benefits all students and their families to come; it benefits our local businesses who look to our graduates for their workforce; and, it benefits our city as a place where businesses want to relocate.",

Many of our residents have chronic conditions and live in sub-standard “slum” housing, which can cause serious health issues including acute asthma, lead poisoning and sinusitis. Living under the stress of poverty, overcrowding and with the constant fear of eviction causes anxiety and other mental health issues. Due to historic disinvestment, South LA is under-resourced in basic care, preventative and mental health services to remedy these issues.

Annually, approximately 10,000 service members transition home into LA County, but many struggle to adjust to civilian life. PTSD and other stresses have devastating effects on this population. 20 American heroes take their lives daily, only 3 are under the care of the VA; rates of veteran drug abuse and homelessness in LA Country are just as unacceptable. PTSD and mental health conditions are closely linked to legal problems for veterans, but the military has instilled a culture of not asking for help. Unfavorable legal outcomes for Veterans in LA County are a strong indicator of future problems and a downward spiral for this population.

During our first year (10/17-10/18), we averaged helping 10 Veterans per month. This average grew to approx. 20 per month over the next 9 months and now averages about 38 per month. Clearly the growth trajectory is accelerating and unsustainable without additional funding. We will measure success by maintaining growth at a rate where we will be able to consistently provide help to at least 50 Veterans per month. An additional measure of our success will be achieving the goal of making training available to the more than 1,000 LA country court-appointed attorneys and the many private attorneys on proper usage of the California diversion and alternative sentencing statutes. We also have set a goal to automate our website, intake forms, referral process and to establish an automated process to identify the most at-risk Veterans so that these individuals can be provided extra assistance, especially rapid referral to mental health services, and to better leverage our limited staff resources to meet our goal of helping an average of 50 Veterans and Veteran families each month.

We have helped more than 640 Veterans seek diversion and alternative sentencing under the California statutes while also connecting Vets to other essential services. Our reach is extensive with 17 local College Veteran Resources Center partners referring their student Veterans. We train hundreds of court-appointed and private attorneys to gain favorable outcomes, keeping our Vets out of the worst part of our legal system. This leverage among these influential groups is key to our success as we have been able to reach Vets in need and the attorney advocates, but we are also straining under this growth. Our dedication of purpose will allow this proven model to expand to meet the growing need – for the benefit of the Vet and the entire community.",

LA County has more veterans than any other county in California, with about 330,000. Our veterans are 6 times more likely to commit suicide, up to 30% have experienced PTSD, and Veteran unemployment is 34% higher than the population. These numbers are even more dramatic for combat veterans. Research proves it is the military service that has caused the disparity compared to the general population. Breaking the cycle of incarceration, homelessness, substance abuse and the deterioration of veteran family units is not only needed to benefit our communities, it pays a debt that is owed to these brave men and women who served our country in its time of need.",

Even though a lot of work has been done to bring healthier food choices into our area, lack of exercise still remains a problem for youth & their families. ESRBC believes group bike rides is the solution to these issues.

In early 2020, the Foundation opened the Everytable Lounge, a unique partnership with social enterprise, where in lieu of charging rent, the company pays in meals. Between 500-800 meals per week are distributed to food insecure students. Shortly thereafter, COVID-19 caused thousands of students to lose jobs and all classes moved to a digital learning format. SMC Foundation responded immediately and pivoted to direct-to-student home delivery services. In 2019, 54% of SMC students were food insecure. During the 2020-21 academic year, the Meal Project endeavors to serve students remotely who were previously identified as food insecure as well as students newly affected by the fallout of COVID-19 and its ongoing economic impact.",

Success can be measured by comparing attendance currently at CSP sites with days that the Mobile Recreation vehicle is on site. Attendance will be monitored by the Mobile Recreation staff for each site and date they visit by tracking the number of people, gender, and whether they are youth or adults.

    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "RAP envisions an accessible park system for all residents and is committed to equity by specifically focusing its resources to close disparities in park access and park program participation. According to the Trust for Public Land, 39% of residents in the City of Los Angeles do not live within a ten minute walk or ½ mile from a park. CSP sites are in communities that do not have a park within a 10-minute walk from their home. Opening LAUSD playgrounds on weekends is the first step in creating much needed access to open spaces in the communities that are lacking this feature. Providing a Mobile Recreation program at these sites will bring access to equipment, supplies, and instructors that is much needed in these communities."

Research shows that children who do not master early literacy skills experience a decreased rate of reading skill acquisition, tending to fall further and faster behind in reading than their peers, a phenomenon called the Matthew Effect (Stanovich,1986). Being below grade-level proficiency after fourth grade is equivalent to being shut out of content learning in class (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2011). Reading Partners targets low-income elementary students who have yet to master basic foundational reading skills and who are six months to two-and-a-half years behind grade level proficiency.",

In each school, Reading Partners transforms a dedicated space into a reading center and recruits at least 50 volunteer tutors to serve 40 or more students. Our student-tutor pairs work together for 45 minutes twice per week, following an individualized reading plan tailored to each student’s particular needs and strengths as well as Reading Partners’ strategic goals for student reading achievement. To execute this plan, tutors use Reading Partners’ curriculum, a series of research-based, structured lessons plans that progress from phonics instruction for early readers to comprehension strategy instruction for more advanced students.",

This year, a group of approximately 20 Kid City alumni received training from the Center for Council in facilitating small groups (often called councils, listening circles, or story circles). They are interested in using the process to share stories and build a deeper sense of community among young people and others from marginalized communities. The Museum of Social Justice provides context and history for particular movements and times in social justice history upon which to center the story circles.

In the short term, story circles will bring a new audience to the museum. There, they may hear a story different, but parallel or similar to their own. Story circles are an intimate form of public art, which rests with the participants themselves.

Of members reporting income, 87% live at or below the federal poverty line. Our community is primarily Latinx. Residents face high rates of violence and drug use, growing homelessness, underperforming schools, and limited access to healthy food and safe recreational space – all leading to increases in childhood substance abuse, conduct disorders and elevated dropout rates. Per the National Council for Behavioral Health, people of color encounter significant disparities accessing mental health resources and increased stigma. The National Institutes of Health report that Latinos experience socioeconomic barriers because of language, acculturation and immigration status.",

Our community also includes a high number of undocumented families facing additional barriers to services because of language and immigration status. A Place Called Home will be critical to filling the gaps in the social safety net in South LA, particularly for families who are not eligible for federal benefits through the CARES Act, by providing direct services and making referrals.",

By the end of the year, A Place Called Home will provide 20,000 hours of free individualized mental health and family services in Spanish and English, serve 34,000 meals on site and distribute 3,000 bags of groceries to food insecure families, and serve 1,000 unduplicated youth. In addition to one-on-one therapy, we will work with parents/guardians and youth to support healthy dynamics at home. We will provide case management services to help families access the resources they need. Participants will show better self-regulation, better communication skills, reduced interpersonal conflict and improved conflict resolution skills, and improvement in academic outcomes. We collect data regularly by survey to measure behavioral outcomes, and maintain case management files to evaluate impacts. Long-term success at A Place Called Home means that: 1) members have increased capacity for prosocial, non-prejudicial and nonviolent interaction with peers, teachers, other adults, family and community members; 2) increased likelihood that members will remain in school, graduate, and go on to pursue higher learning and/or meaningful employment; 3) reduced likelihood of involvement in the juvenile justice system; and 4) members can take full ownership of their lives, and feel empowered to make a difference in their communities and in the world.",

If people believe their neighborhoods are unsafe, children are less likely to play outside, and adults are warier about taking part in physical activities. Residents who perceive their neighborhoods as dangerous have significantly higher body mass index’s than those who consider their communities safe. Studies found that higher levels of crime reduce walking or physical activity, especially among women and young children. Conversely, those who live in areas with more trust tend to have higher levels of activity.

We’re now working with educator partners to quantify how Ava might help increase self-confidence, self-advocacy, and feelings of belonging. We also track our impact by qualitative personal stories of players touched by our characters, narrative, and gameplay.",

    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "Our focus groups and target pilot schools are mainly charter schools in the greater LA area that serve about 70-90% students of color because we’ve seen such a huge need for our product here. According to interviews with educators and counselors in communities like these, counselors are overwhelmed and outnumbered by the sheer number of students in need of their services and social-emotional skills development. We’ve gotten feedback from professionals in these environments that Ava could be useful in modeling behavior and as supplemental learning (or “cooldown time”) for students with conditions other than autism, such as ADHD, PTSD, and anxiety.",

    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "Autistic youth are told they don’t belong, that social/emotional skills will always be a struggle for them. They’re told that their identity is an insult (e.g. ‘autistic’ as a slur), that they’re broken and need to be fixed. They’re 5x as likely to be bullied and 10x as likely to die by suicide compared to neurotypical peers. We believe there are two root causes of this issue: the lack of positive, nuanced representation of autistic characters in media and the focus that digital autism products hold on changing behavior, rather than empowering autistic youth to embrace who they are. Autistic youth are also 2 times as likely to play video games. While this is in part due to the structured and objective design of games, there’s another underlying reason: video games make us feel safe. They give us a space to understand and interact with human experiences without fear of judgement or rejection.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "As CEO, I have a background in neuroscience research and a deeply personal connection to autism–I’m autistic. I started this company because of the mental health challenges that I faced growing up on the spectrum. My team and I are determined to create a future in which neurodivergent youth never have to go through what I did. Our games are built by and for the autism community, based on autism community feedback, and deliver social emotional learning and support through a medium that autistic youth already enjoy.",

    "Which of the LIVE metrics will your submission impact?​": "Housing affordability",
    "Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?": "Eviction prevention has become an even higher priority as the covid-19 pandemic has caused millions of renters in LA County to wonder if they can pay their rent. Keeping our homes IS public health. Without a home, exposure to the coronavirus is dramatically worsened. Temporary emergency measures protect many tenants, but only for a limited time. Now more than ever, tenants need easy access to tools and resources to help exercise their rights and stay in their homes. In the coronavirus era, easy-to-use and multi-lingual online resources are essential to making critical services available to people who need it the most. In rapid response to the current crisis, we created NoRent.org, which has helped tenants throughout the County protect themselves from unlawful evictions.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "South LA",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project?": "Pilot project or new program",
    "Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.": "JustFix",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "SAJE helps lead the LA Right to Counsel coalition and supports the coalition organizing in support of the recent rent stabilization ordinance in the County. In response to the coronavirus, SAJE helped lead efforts to ensure tenants gain protections from displacement to prevent further public health challenges. SAJE’s work on OWN IT! (https://www.ownit.la/) similarly leveraged technology to help enhance code enforcement capabilities with LA County and reduce slum living conditions. Paired with tenant-friendly policies, technology can be a powerful tool to connect individuals at risk of eviction. SAJE will build on the success of OWN IT! and the experience of JustFix’s right to counsel website. JustFix built a first-of-its-kind screening tool for Right to Counsel in NYC, helping connect 4,000+ tenants with free legal representation in just the first year. The technology can be paired with a variety of community organizing campaigns SAJE is engaged in locally and countywide.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this proposal?​": "Direct Impact: 10,000",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "This proposal aligns with a nationwide movement to ensure tenants have a right to counsel in eviction cases. While there is a right to counsel in criminal cases, there is no comparative legal right in civil cases. Other cities, including New York City, are enacting right to counsel protections for tenants. SAJE’s proven track record at addressing slum housing conditions and helping tenants to better advocate for themselves will allow LA neighborhoods to determine their own future as the city grows. Increased legal representation will help prevent displacement, reduce homelessness, and allow more tenants to remain in their homes and continue to influence the future of their communities.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "SAJE envisions that this project will complement its current actions on tenants rights and equitable development in LA and similar efforts by groups across LA County. Through the existing Tenant Action Clinics and outreach efforts, including partnerships with broad coalitions and LA County, SAJE will educate tenants on their right to legal counsel for eviction issues. Success in this project would be the launch of a user-friendly web-based tool to help tenants navigate the complexities of the phased roll-out process and an outreach campaign to ensure the target population is aware of and able to use eviction defense resources. Success will be measured by the completion and publication of the website and by the active use of the tool by tenants in LA County.",
    "Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?​": "Access to the LA2050 community",
    "If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.": "SAJE will be conducting the work in LA County to inform tenants of their new right to counsel. In building up their outreach and education efforts, SAJE will work with JustFix to build off of the success of JustFix’s work on New York City’s right to counsel for tenants. Utilizing a co-design process, tenants who participate in SAJE programs, SAJE organizers, and JustFix staff will develop a tool that is accessible to tenants. SAJE will devote its expertise in eviction prevention, tenant rights, and years of experience conducting outreach and organizing with tenants from the most vulnerable communities in Los Angeles. JustFix will bring tremendous design, product management, technical engineering, and software development expertise and experience, having created similar tools in NYC.",
    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "Avoiding eviction helps prevent homelessness and ensures that tenants do not have to leave their homes just so landlords can reap higher profits. LA County’s new Eviction Defense Program rolls out tenant protections, including legal counsel, to five Los Angeles zip codes this summer. The new eviction prevention resources will increase tenants’ ability to remain in their current home and reduce homelessness. In the coronavirus era, keeping people in their homes is more than ever a matter of life and death. Residents need to be informed of the rights and services available to them by a trusted source. SAJE is a trusted source in South LA and helps convene the Right to Counsel Coalition, a broad network across LA County. With easy-to-access technology, SAJE and JustFix aim to create an online resource for tenants to access the information and referrals they need to exercise their rights in a moment when in-person support and screening are challenged by the need for physical distancing."

This project will build on the basic needs advocacy campaigns Rise launched on 4 college campuses with 25 student organizers in 2019 through the LA2050 Grants Challenge. To meet the growing demand for basic needs programs, as well as students’ overwhelming desire to participate in this advocacy, Rise plans to lead an online advocacy course in 2020.

Once registered, students are more likely to vote and become informed participants in our democracy. Young Latinx voters are one of the fastest growing segments of the electorate but had some of the lowest voter turnout rates in CA in 2018 per the California Civic Engagement Project. TCC, through its student-led VR drives and volunteers, makes it easy and engaging for students to register. Peer-to-peer outreach, instead of a top-down approach, gets better results and also drives TCC’s partnership with SRLA that has built an active, engaged community of youth.

Men’s work may be nothing new, but our approach is completely radical and different from what has come before and what currently exists. Much of that work is not in conscious dialogue with broader social questions, but treats men’s issues as stand-alone and solipsistic. Our work is unique in its nature.

The damaging beliefs I’d had about all men being toxic had corroded my sense of self. I realized all men (not just trans men) are isolated, depressed and suicidal, as indicated by the statistics.

Research shows that gender diversity produces greater organizational success in all areas of study/thought. Additionally, women often have more awareness of issues specifically affecting women and families. More women in STEM will identify new issues that need to be developed. Moreover, there are even fewer women in STEM positions of power/leadership. Thus, women have little voice in deciding which research innovations are pursued.

Exposing them to paths of possibility and potential gives students the opportunity to know what they can achieve. Big City Lab develops bridges to community, helping students shape a vision for their neighborhoods in the short term, while aiming to develop a sustained, equitable vision for transformative social change.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "In 2016 we received a grant from the SPArt Foundation to pilot Big City Lab at Camino Nuevo Miramar High School in the MacArthur Park neighborhood. Through Big City Lab students explored the history, story lines, and social conditions embedded in their communities by examining issues related to identity, storytelling, social justice, and public space. By working with professionals in the areas of urban planing and design, photo journalism, and creative writing students were able to use tools in these disciplines to develop an entire research methodology that allowed them to understand how these issues impact their own communities and began to shape their own perspectives to build a sense of how they can impact change. Most importantly the project allowed the students to develop their own critical thinking about these issues by putting forth strategies in which they could express their own perspectives. The goal is to replicate the program with far more students across CNCA schools."

But rather than displacing our neighbors and gentrifying communities, we should create verdant new neighborhoods on tree-lined “boulevards of opportunity” with moderate-density mixed-use development and housing affordable to people who are low and very-low income or homeless. LA is served by many boulevards that were once key contributors to local economies but are now marginalized, where properties are relatively inexpensive. Measure M set aside $2 billion to build bus rapid transit (BRT) along a dozen such corridors, providing an opportunity to revitalize them as appealing neighborhoods where transit riders can live. The Southern California Association of Governments once identified such boulevards as our most significant housing opportunity because they would allow us to meet our housing needs on just 2% of the region’s land.

In order to achieve success we’ll also engage community leaders and advocates, resiliency experts, academics, planners, and affordable and market-rate developers. We’ll stage 2 symposiums to engage everyone in dialogue about the policy changes and strategies that will be required, and we’ll write a well-designed publication to share that identifies successful policies, tools and strategies for community development along these boulevards of opportunity.",

Using boulevards of opportunity to address the affordable housing crisis marries our knowledge of transit and affordable housing policies and our familiarity with the tools of local government. Because funding will be needed to improve these boulevards, Move LA sponsored SB 961 (Sen. Allen), signed into law in 2018, to enable cities to create redevelopment-style districts along transit corridors. With our deep understanding of community development, our successful history working to build robust and durable coalitions, and our understanding of how to leverage public funds, we are uniquely positioned to show cities how to do it and create a model program for others to learn from."

Using surveys, site observations and online tools, Up2Us Sports will determine whether coaches have increased competency for 1) addressing fitness and mental health issues facing their youth and 2) designing coaching practices that engage all of their players in physical activity and positive youth development. Up2Us Sports will visit key programs to observe coaches and offer direct support. Up2Us Sports anticipates that 90% or more of coaches will feel more confident and better equipped to help LA youth heal after attending coach training. In cases in which Up2Us Sports directly places subsidized coaches in LA neighborhoods, we will measure their success by conducting PACER Tests and pre-and post surveys on youth to evaluate direct improvements in both physical activity and non-cognitive skill building, such as resiliency and pro-social attachment.",

    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "Our broader impact is to train at least 10000 coaches throughout LA and to place 100 trained and subsidized coaches in communities that lack sufficient sports opportunities for youth. Collectively, we seek to inspire more than 50,000 youth. With LA2050, these goals are achievable because Up2Us Sports will have the resources to establish a citywide strategy for coach training and placement. We believe this is critical not just because of the need for mentors post-Covid-19 but also because LA is the Olympic host in 2028. Ensuring that our city’s coaches are capable of helping our youth achieve their potential will be a hallmark for this city’s preparedness in demonstrating the best of sports on a global stage."

In underrepresented and underserved communities, parental knowledge of water-based activities can be limited, translating to significant psychological and social barriers for children. Parents in these demographics tend to be more accustomed to higher levels of risk and lower qualities and availability of resources, and therefore take a more substantial role in “bridging” their child’s extracurricular activities.

We have been a leader and innovator in education for 14 years with a reputation for integrity in program implementation and effectiveness. We have a long partnership with LAUSD for delivery of our In-School Program. Our curriculum aligns with the Common Core and VAPA Standards and is Univ of CA ‘A-G’ approved. Because of its success in engaging students at risk of missing on-time graduation, LAUSD has certified our curriculum as an Intervention Course. Whereas other organizations are only beginning to ramp up online programs, we are prepared, savvy, and secure in this arena, with a vast amount of content at the ready. We are already working with tech companies Agency 39A and Extension Engine in preparation for the launch, and LAUSD is now using Flipgrid video technology to record our students’ performances.

County. Currently, there is no similar program in existence, especially with the outreach, academic rigor, and adaptability to student needs that ours features. The online curriculum will be designed to be interactive, exciting, and engaging. It will include “Blitz” performances by our teen poetry troupe the Get Lit Players, virtual mentoring sessions, guest speakers, the Get Lit Scoremetrics app where students and teachers can see writing and performance feedback from their peers in real time, as well settings for teacher/student and student/student interactions. The app collects and analyzes evaluations, enabling teachers to record and document student growth, in both writing and performance, as well as assess the effectiveness of the curriculum. This cutting-edge curriculum will culminate in the opportunity for youth to compete in our Classic Slam. Lessons will incorporate video links, Google Docs, and Zoom sessions, offering students sequential instruction, a nimble forum for dialogues on pertinent subjects, mentorship, and support for youth who feel isolated and traumatized, especially during COVID-19. To evaluate the online program, Get Lit staff will survey teachers and students utilizing the curriculum each semester, focusing on ease of use, content quality, depth of learning, and the number of schools that are implementing the system.",

What the COVID-19 crisis has made clear is that the current offerings in distance education are often shells of classroom curricula, and do not provide students with adequate, or in some cases any, opportunity for intellectual challenges, or for feedback, discussion, and connection. Through our robust program, students improve their reading comprehension, vocabulary, and writing skills; increase critical thinking and public speaking abilities; develop greater academic engagement and self-efficacy; and build vital social skills rooted in self-awareness, confidence, personal responsibility, and compassion. We currently serve 120 southern CA schools with approximately 8,500 students.

It will ignite students’ love of language, provide them with tools for empowerment and success, and support college readiness. It will change the dynamics and power structures, allowing all students, including those not comfortable speaking, to share stories and engage in cross-city dialogue. It will provide socio-emotional support, facilitate connection and active civic engagement. Our plan is to offer this curriculum to all of California, followed by nationally."

There is no reason that construction workers get paid real wages and benefits while they learn on the job, and creative work in the media industry is based on internships designed for those who can afford to work for free. Digital content producers and editors are in high demand while companies and institutions are making new commitments to diversity in front of and behind the camera -- with little experience in actually achieving a diverse, inclusive workforce. There is growing awareness of the dearth of young producers and editors of color in Hollywood, as well as other marginalized groups across the industry. The need for mentored training for low-income creative workers as well as support for employers in this critical reshaping of the industry has never been greater."

If given access to funds—and the right to choose how to spend it—our data show that parents spend on what they need most. 2) Fewer restrictions, more results. Offering more cash and cash-like supports (WIC, SNAP), not less, is the most effective way of reducing child poverty. However, burdensome eligibility criteria and enrollment procedures and the “benefits cliff” prevent families from accessing what they need. 3) More bang for your (public) buck.

Today, students can go K-12th grade with no arts education at all. “And now that [music is] gone, many administrators don’t know how to get it back” says Patricia Wayne, Prog. Dir., Create CA. Students enrolled in school art programs have higher attendance and graduation rates, higher reading levels, fewer discipline problems and stronger social-emotional skills according to Laura Smyth, Prog. Dir., Title I Initiative CA Alliance for Arts Education. And because some children in public schools are getting high-quality arts education and others are not, “It’s no longer just a school issue, it’s a moral issue. There’s a huge equity gap.”",

In a school setting, children with disabilities are 60% more likely to be involved in bullying. This lack of social interaction, which provides critical developmental benefits, and continued negative peer experiences can impact lives well into adulthood. One study found that 85% of the adults with disabilities who reported losing their jobs did so due to a lack of social skills. There are almost 65,000 children with disabilities in LAUSD. We are a diverse city, and now more than ever, the most vulnerable families need to connect in a truly inclusive and meaningful way. Connect LA Families will level the playing field by empowering community organizations to create compassionate connections in their neighborhoods.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "Most of the children served by Connect Families LA will be between the ages of 1 and 13 and come from a variety of socio-economic circumstances. The children we work with have a wide range of conditions, which include Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Fragile Bone Disease, Rhetts Syndrome, Visual Impairment, Deafness, and many others. Many of our children have multiple disabilities, which result in both physical and mental impairments, and most of the students that participate in our programs are classified as having moderate to severe disabilities. Of the children we work with, 80% of them attend Title 1, which is an indicator of poverty.",

For over 20 years, we have been helping Los Angeles neighborhoods create inclusive community play spaces. There are 42 open in Los Angeles County. In 2002, we began two social inclusion programs that activate these community spaces because we realized families were not utilizing them due to the social/emotional bias their children experienced in public…stares, rude comments, questions, and peers excluding them. Overcoming this barrier required an intentional structure that supported our families socially and emotionally. My PlayClub, our successful and proven family program, provides a powerful social network for families of all abilities through fully integrated play events and online resources. Our education program extends that connection into those children’s schools, educating their teachers and peers on how to facilitate social inclusion on their campuses.",

While Altadena has affluent areas, there is a disparity in income among the residents, particularly between East and West Altadena where the population concentration is highest. Altadena’s median household income is $88,236; the per capita income is $41,372 falling under the CARE income limits for a family of four. Altadena’s income disparity is larger than both Los Angeles county and the nation as a whole. 85% of local public-school students are considered socioeconomically disadvantaged, and schools across our community have closed. These inequalities and loss of learning and literacy resources threaten to widen income, opportunity, and quality of life disparities in our area. The Altadena Libraries are committed to helping students and their families who do not have equal opportunity to technology, literacy, and other learning resources through outreach projects, such as a Mobile Library.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "A successful mobile library program would include a robust schedule of outreach events across all Census Tracts in our community, prioritizing opportunities on the west side of Altadena. Equipped with technology and materials in the vehicle, these events would build cohesion between community members around engaging activities in their neighborhoods, offer regular hours for Wi-Fi access in areas in need, increase library card signups and circulation of educational materials through mobile check-outs, and facilitate a spirit of service through volunteer opportunities, all operated out of a modified van.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "Altadena lacks structured communication systems and a City Hall. The Library absorbs traffic that a local government would address; thus, we can connect our community directly with key services and build civic engagement. A mobile library brings people key services directly and library cards, which plug them into our information-sharing network. Using heat maps, we can focus the efforts of our mobile library on areas without library cards, extending our reach. This would engage more people into conversations that our libraries conduct to gather resident data then used to guide decision-making in our libraries and our Altadena Town Council, which shares Altadena’s needs with LA County directly, impacting our entire service population.",

The Altadena Libraries are two of the only public places for access to technology, free educational materials and programming, and community building. In addition to thousands of visits by library patrons, the Library hosts over 300 community educational programs and events each year, with attendance of over 10,000, and actively looks for more ways to reach out to the community and provide library services beyond our physical walls. With a proven history of service to San Gabriel Valley, Altadena Library District is an excellent choice for investing capital for projects to LEARN, CREATE, PLAY, CONNECT, AND LIVE.",

Our catalog features an increasing array of writers and stories: 2021 will see us team with 20 emerging authors new to Red Hen. We regularly host events with our authors in our in-house event space—the Hen House Literary Center—and work with local establishments like Vroman’s, Skylight Books, Book Soup, and the Annenberg.

With Take Action, we ask: What if active, compassionate volunteers were empowered with the specific information and tools needed to advocate for lasting changes in policy on these issues? Guided by experts in the field, volunteers are becoming our strongest advocates to drive solution-oriented approaches. In light of COVID19, L.A. Works has pivoted its bootcamps to a virtual format.

The community garden will assist in financial savings to those unemployed and those with low incomes. Short-term goal would be to open the woman’s fitness center with group fitness classes first. Long-term goal would be in building out to include more equipment and spa services. The short-term goal for the community garden would be to implement 4-6 raised beds for growing.

Parents in this area often have to choose between paying rent, buying groceries or getting health care. Over half a million people in SPA 4 struggle daily with economic distress and high rates of mental illness and chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "Founded as The Los Angeles Free Clinic in 1967, our organization has built a reputable history in providing health care services to low-income, medically deprived people. Renamed in 2013 as Saban Community Clinic (SCC), SCC is now a prominent health care resource for those hardest hit by poverty. Last year, SCC supplied over $9 million dollars in free health care services and helped nearly 21,500 patients.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this proposal?​": "Direct Impact: 1,400",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "The Family Health Center has tremendous potential to improve community health. The site is in a low-income, high need area. Within SPA 4, about 30% of Latino adults report having no regular source of medical care. In the Center's zip code, over half the residents are Latino, and four out of every ten children live in low-income households. SCC’s Community Needs Assessment (2018) found that 16% of children in this area had never been to the dentist, and had an even greater need for mental health services."

The mental and emotional challenges, lack of stability and attachments, and sadly, the violence and abuse often experienced by young people in the system translate into disproportionately high rates of homelessness, incarceration, poor academic achievement, unemployment, and a reliance on public assistance. Youth in foster care experience particular challenges related to obtaining an education. In academic year 2018/19, only 57.3% of LA County foster youth graduated high school compared to 84.2% overall.

In the long term, success will be viewed by those very same numbers but also through the interns who choose to contribute toward funding for future college interns in need of financial support to participate in our program. Success will also be viewed in both the short and long terms by examining whether our internship providers will contribute funds to support our interns.

The Center works with over 200 internship providers in Los Angeles to put students into internships during the fall and spring semesters as well as the summer. On average, the Center places 30 to 40 students per semester during the academic year and 20 to 30 during the summer. The Center has a dedicated staff that works with students to place them in internships of their interest but also to ensure we meet the needs of the internship providers. Students not only complete their required time at their internship but also complete professionalization workshops and academic requirements. The intra-structure within the Center ensures that students can be placed in internships while learning about life after college in the workforce."

This simple exercise, along with the docent’s presentation, prepares students to recognize and appreciate their own, and other, cultural traditions. Currently, over 25,000 students benefit from this program annually, as do their teachers and other school staff. Parents and students tell CCMM about stories students bring home after their participation with CCMM, objects and traditions they recognized from their own cultures or new things they learned about other peoples.

For college students, the college fair and professional development workshops help them take important steps toward workforce readiness and increase college persistence. Since 1977, we have empowered LA youth to access and succeed in college.

Each year, we enroll in our program 20-25 former foster youth “Scholars” on their way to becoming part of only 3% of foster youth nationally who will obtain a bachelor's by age 26. In college, however, they continue to lack traditional supports that more privileged peers receive through family. In turn, they are significantly more likely to drop out, saddled with debt and no degree. The COVID crisis creates yet another barrier for youth who are already so vulnerable.

In addition to coaching foster youth in the “hidden” tools and skills for success that youth who grow up in stable families with financial and social resources often gain through role modeling, we physically connect youth to the career mentors, internships, job positions, and company contacts needed to open doors. Our partner Stepping Forward LA – which possess a uniquely 100% former foster youth-staff – has cultivated a strong community of 50+ adult mentors who provide social and emotional support to foster youth on an ongoing basis.

The disruption of schedules and daily routine, shifting of household roles, financial stress, and the physical and emotional availability of either parent all contribute to these problems. If overlooked or untreated, these problems can persist into adulthood.” Although responses to parental cancer can vary based on age and the individual, common themes among these children are uncertainty, fear, guilt, and anxiety. Furthermore, in a study conducted in 2007, 53% of siblings of cancer patients between ages 8 and 18 reported moderate to severe post-traumatic stress symptoms. These high rates of post-traumatic stress among siblings included emotional reactions such as fear, worry, sadness, helplessness, anger and guilt, as well as school and academic difficulties.",

    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "Data shows that the major barriers to fulfilling the promise of green jobs are not lack of training programs or skilled workforce, but rather a time-delay skills mismatch (i.e., a rapidly changing industry’s workforce needs outpacing program development and recruitment timelines) primarily due to the lack of connection between quality career training programs with employers who will eventually hire trainees. Leveraging its unique assets as a nonprofit cleantech incubator, LACI closes the loop in workforce development for the burgeoning green economy by providing continuity from identification of real-world demand for workforce skills to training and job placement. Together with LACI, Gladeo’s new learner-facing microsite for “Green Careers in Los Angeles” will serve as a valuable platform for communicating timely, industry-vetted information directly with learners in a way that’s cost-effective, sustainable, and adaptable to the long-term needs of a continuously changing industry.",

State civics curricula are heavy on knowledge and facts but light on building skills and agency for civic engagement. And it shows - 23% of 8th graders in the United States are proficient in civics and this is even lower among low-income and minority youth. This creates a civic engagement gap where youth become less visible and less heard as citizens than other demographics and therefore easier to ignore by their decision-makers, resulting in long-term and far-reaching effects on equity in communities. in the United States.",

While we know the problem of homelessness isn’t always associated with substance abuse disorders, we do know if there is a problem with this addiction, if it is not addressed, there is little to no hope for the person. Our Healthy Living program incorporates the already successful 12-step philosophy used in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), combined with case management plans, which provide the tools needed to achieve & maintain self-sufficiency.",

Through this program, CYLA has the ability to add capacity to under-resourced schools and help meet the holistic needs of all students by integrating academic and social-emotional supports throughout the school day. Our AmeriCorps members forge positive, caring relationships with students and help create an environment in which students can build on their strengths, take risks in their learning and feel connected to their school. Expansion into IUSD is deeply aligned with CYLA’s goals and priorities, as we seek to provide support to schools where students can benefit the most.

With this proposal we want to continue to bring these enhancements to our two Inglewood Unified School District campuses.

While students from higher-income households have access to private tutoring, college counseling, and test preparation outside of school, most students from low-income households do not. This fact gives students with more financial resources a clear advantage when preparing for college entrance exams. Ninety percent of CollegeSpring students in Los Angeles qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and only 28% of graduates from Los Angeles public high schools enroll at four-year colleges and universities. Over 100,000 juniors in Los Angeles County need test prep each year. When only some students have access to adequate preparation, the test fails to fulfill its primary purpose—to fairly and accurately reflect all students’ ability to succeed in college. Equitable test preparation at a system level can help transform Los Angeles into a city where all students fulfill their college potential."

However, what makes our program unique is our use of neer-peer health educators, our focus on mental health, and overall our evidence-informed health education curriculum that incorporates pedagogical best practices and focuses on skill-building in support of health. This not only distinguishes our model from other health education programs but also improves our impact on youth. As slightly older peers, PHE's college-aged health educators are well positioned to lead honest conversations about high school students’ choices and health. We have found through evaluation of our program that the high school students are often more comfortable asking sensitive and challenging health questions of college volunteers than a traditional teacher."

KCB inspires, equips, and mobilizes hundreds of volunteers each year from churches, businesses, city leadership, service clubs, and other non-profit organizations. By balancing services, partnerships, and ongoing community dialogue, KCB maintains a philosophy that all of us are better than any of us. KCB dreams of a flourishing community where everyone has a place to live, a place to work, and a place to belong. KCB was founded in 2001 by residents who desired collaborative solutions to the tangible challenges facing low-income families. Today, KCB is an experienced homeless services provider but also utilizes existing neighborhood resources, facilitates strategic conversations, and seeks solutions that maximize community investment.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "The population served by Kingdom Causes Bellflower (KCB) is the low-income residents of Bellflower, California, though the organization also serves residents from surrounding cities in Los Angeles County. These cities include Artesia, Cerritos, Compton, Downey, Lynwood, Norwalk, and Paramount. Our proposal will provide practical, developmental skills for 150 individuals who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness. There will be 12 different educational opportunities, and emphasis will be placed on recruiting a diversity of volunteer facilitators, including formerly homeless individuals. The indirect impact will encompass the larger constituency of KCB, and include aspects of awareness and opportunities for volunteering.",

For these groups, the bicycle may be their only feasible means of accessing essential resources, including employment, education, health care, and social services. While the bicycle can be a fun, safe, healthy, and accessible form of transportation, many individuals who could benefit from owning a bike cannot afford to buy one and do not know how to maintain or ride one safely on the streets of Los Angeles. If these individuals could have access to bikes and develop maintenance and safe riding skills, it would not only increase their mobility and access to fundamental resources, but also provide them with the empowerment, enjoyment, and health benefits of owning and riding a bike that they know how to repair themselves if needed.",

The Bicycle Kitchen stands at a unique intersection within bicycling culture: we interject our do-it-yourself, co-op spirit into the bicycle community as a whole, and we already serve many underprivileged groups that have limited access to other modes of transportation. The Bicycle Kitchen has successfully implemented aspects of this proposal separately in the past, but we have never integrated them together into a single streamlined program due to lack of funds and adequate staff.

Access to a working bicycle will help expand participants’ mobility and create economic and other opportunities. Bicycling also has a number of health benefits. For instance, cycling commuters have lower rates of cancer and heart disease compared to other types of commuters. Furthermore, cycling has a lower environmental impact than driving, and more cyclists on the road will help mitigate the growing problems related to motorized vehicle traffic throughout Los Angeles. These benefits would have substantial social, economic, and environmental impacts, and pave the way towards a better version of the city we all love and call home.",

We envision greatly increasing the number of both low-cost and pro-bono clinical hours as well as hours/space available through the Residency program through continued fiscal growth and support. At present, our sliding scale and pro-bono services account for over 35% of our clinical offerings, and we have designated 15% of our total space (hours) for our Residency programming. In the coming year, we would like to increase our low-cost and pro-bono services to 50% of our clinical services, and designate 25% of our space for Residency offerings.

Through the Residency, we can provide no-cost space to at least 10 facilitators and estimate that Residents will reach a minimum of 10 ppl/event at 4 events/Resident.

    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports that one-in-four individuals experiences a mental illness each year, underscoring a critical need for mental healthcare access across all patient populations. Access to holistic services that support mental health tends to be particularly our of reach for those who identify as LGBTQ+, BIPOC, (im)migrant, and/or low income. That limited care access is not for lack of patient motivation. According to the National Council on Behavioral Health, 56% of surveyed individuals desired a mental healthcare provider, but faced care barriers. Access to mental health services outside of clinic and agency environments generally require that individuals have insurance, be able to pay out-of-pocket, or both. And even when an individual or family can find an affordable provider, lack of practitioner availability, fragmented or ineffective care, and societal stigma are getting in the way of their access to holistic, culturally-competent services.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "We believe that access to holistic services that support mental health and wellness is a human right, and recognize that it is often out of reach for many, particularly those who identify as LGBTQ+, BIPOC, (im)migrant, and/or low income. Through our shift away from industry culture over the past 2 years, we have sought to amplify Social justice; Cultural Humility, Sensitivity, and Inclusivity; Collaboration; Respect; Integrity; and Creativity. We also promote these same values internally, in order to create an atmosphere of open communication and mutual support. Through our sliding scale & pro-bono services we have offered compassionate, culturally-informed, and client-centered care to dozens of individuals and families in the Los Angeles community. This reach has expanded through our Residency program which offers use of our space at no-cost to artists, educators, and practitioners outside our practice in exchange for additional therapeutic services to the community at low or no cost.",

    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "LA’s transportation system is not sustainable, or affordable and desperately needs an overhaul. We need walkable sidewalks, protected bike lanes, streets where cars travel at slower speeds and buses have their own lanes. There has been “a staggering 75% increase in the number of pedestrian deaths between 2015 and 2018”, Cars are expensive and transportation is the major contributor of GHGs and air pollution, putting those who live near freeways at high risk for pandemics like COVID-19. Many people who used to ride buses and trains have been pushed to housing farther out from their jobs, schools, and healthcare resources they depend on. All are major reasons transit ridership is down, traffic is up, and we’re scared to walk and bike.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "We would define and measure success as a powerful, engaged, inclusive constituency and conversation around transportation and transit-oriented communities in the City of Los Angeles. For years the Los Angeles region has struggled to build a transportation advocacy movement that can generate sufficient political will to achieve equitable transportation and land use. Let’s change that by getting more Angelenos involved in dreaming about a more equitable city together.",
    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "Individuals who are walking, biking and riding transit around LA are first hand witnesses to the inequities and needs on the ground. Neighbors understand which is the most dangerous area for crossing the street, and workers know which bus routes are in need of more investment so they can get to work on time. In many cases, people want to get involved in organizing for their community’s transportation needs but aren’t sure how to plug in. Our organizations are increasing the avenues for community involvement and encouraging organizations to collaborate and strengthen their organizing power. Through events, surveys, workshops and more, we will provide on-ramps for community members who want to create an accessible city with better air and water quality, less traffic and thriving streets.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "We are a group of organizations actively working to increase collaboration, trust and power. In the fall of 2019, non-profit organizations: CicLAvia, Investing in Place, Los Angeles Walks, Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition, People for Mobility Justice, Move LA, all transportation non-profits working in Los Angeles, co-created a monthly space where staff could strengthen relationships, share information and develop ideas for collaborative campaigns. We recognized transportation advocacy in the City of Los Angeles needed a reboot. In January 2020, our key partner ACT-LA joined this effort to expand these conversations to include affordable housing near transit and align the group's efforts to engage grassroots organizations in campaigns to win transit justice and equitable transit-oriented communities. All partners are experts in these issues and have relationships with decision-makers. If we collaborate to rethink our transportation system we can contest the status quo."

The extracurricular activities also include an indoor skate park, DJ room, and silk screening studio at no cost. In addition to focusing on their education, we provide them with an entrepreneurial program that teaches them how to develop a brand, create the merchandise via the silk screening studio and marketing the sale of the items they create.

Last year, through our efforts in the Oakland Unified School District, we tracked average daily participation rates pre and post Breakfast After the Bell Implementation across seven schools we supported, which resulted in an average daily student participation increase of 138%. While percentage increases vary based on initial participation, the models chosen to implement and the efficacy of the implementation process, our experience across the country and in California demonstrate these increases are achievable. \\n\\nIn addition to tracking participation rates, we use secondary outputs to track our overall progress to goals related to our specific strategies including:\\n*\\tNumber of schools implementing or committed to implementing Breakfast After the Bell models\\n*\\tNumber of school decision-makers targeted and engaged in conversations toward the goal of breakfast expansion and the strength of those relationships to yield future impact\\n*\\tNumber of school and political champions cultivated.\\n*\\tNumber of Breakfast Champion touch-points created throughout the year through both media and peer-to-peer tactics. \\n\\nAs an organization, we have a uniform reporting structure documenting program participation data: In November, we will have finalized data on participation from the previous school year; In March, we will have preliminary data on the first 3-4 months of the current school year; and in July we will have 7-9 months of the previous school year data. These data points will be used to evaluate and adjust program strategies and to direct planning for each school year. \\n\\nOver the school year, we worked with schools across Southern California and the Greater Los Angeles Region to help them get started on their own of Breakfast After the Bell programs. Here is an example of \\“success\\” and how Breakfast After the Bell impacted a high school in Rialto: \\n\\nLast school year, No Kid Hungry gave Eisenhower High School in Rialto, California a $26,000 grant to start a Breakfast in the Classroom program. Our Breakfast Navigators were on hand to provide technical help and resources. Before Eisenhower started the program, kids could only get breakfast before school started in the cafeteria, and only 400 students were eating breakfast at school.

Food is one of the most significant social determinants of who will have good health and who will suffer from disease and inequities. By connecting kids to healthy food, we can start improving health outcomes today and the adults they become in the future. Meals provided through federal nutrition programs—like free and reduced-price school breakfast and lunch—are healthy and dependable sources of nutrition for kids facing hunger. When schools fully harness federal child nutrition programs, they can serve as nutrition hubs. Breakfast fuels the momentum for ending childhood hunger. Traditional school breakfast is served in the cafeteria before the start of the school day. A late bus, conflicting family work schedules, and the stigma of being the ‘poor kid’ keep millions of children from a healthy morning meal. Only 39% of eligible kids are eating breakfast at school in California.",

Students with disabilities are 2-3 times more likely to be bullied and may avoid school. 83% of general education teachers report that credential programs and training has not prepared them to work with students with disabilities or teach social-emotional skills. Each year, 8% of US teachers leave the classroom before retirement age due to dissatisfaction with support and classroom conditions.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "Circle of Friends partnered with LAUSD from 2015-2018 to develop school inclusion programs and an internal team of trainers. While CoF sites expanded from 10-28 during this time, structural and staffing changes have made it difficult to sustain. Parent concerns about safety and chronic absenteeism for students with disabilities have increased. CoF’s Executive Director has met with LAUSD Parent Center Directors, and they want to bring our program to their schools. LAUSD’s 2017-2019 Action Plan for Achieving Breakthroughs in Outcomes for Students with Disabilities identified inclusion as a goal, establishing pilot sites across the district. Several LAUSD schools want to implement CoF, but the LAUSD trainers do not have the capacity to work with them. With schools closed until the summer or fall as a result of the Coronavirus, many students and teachers will need supports more than ever. Circle of Friends would love to be part of bringing inclusion back to school"

We use community drawn art, spoken word poetry and other artistic endeavors to engage and inspire incarcerated youth to change their narratives about who they are and the impact they have. Our pilot program showed an 86% rise in voting for participants and facilitated deep connections between our incarcerated youth and the organization March for Our Lives.",

    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "When introducing AB 2477 in 2017, ensuring that people incarcerated in jails and juvenile detention facilities in California can exercise their right to vote, Asm Shirley Weber emphasized, “Civic participation can be a critical component of re-entry and has been linked to reduced recidivism.” In response, Creative Acts piloted the ‘Art Attacks’ program in all County Juvenile Facilities (Children’s Prisons). Our students come from communities of color, backgrounds of low socio-economic status, and lives defined by gangs and institutionalization. Our goal was to show them the power of their vote and connect them to leaders in civic engagement so that their organizations can benefit from the input and participation of the most systems impacted people in their communities. 86% of our participants voted in the May 2018 elections. Expanding the program now will help increase those numbers among the most impacted communities in both local and national elections at this crucial time.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "Creative Acts founder Sabra Williams created The Actors’ Gang Prison Project in 2005, and has over 15 years of experience teaching adults and youth behind bars. In addition, the Art Attacks program employs teaching artists who are experienced working with incarcerated youth as well as alumni who have a shared experience of incarceration with our students.The program’s multi-disciplinary arts-based approach offers us the greatest opportunity to meaningfully engage young people. We created this approach because of an understanding of the power of the Arts to create a safe space to heal trauma and to engender deep, non-direct learning. This understanding evolved from fifteen years of bringing arts programming into prison and reentry settings, backed up by research and evidence, documented by mental health professionals and nationally renowned researchers. Our experience with this type of programming makes us uniquely qualified to engage in this work.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "Our Education system is not built to support children dealing with extreme violence & trauma so we lock them up. But given creative ways to learn these young people start to realize their power and importance. Over 95% of them will return to become our neighbors. We ask what kind of neighbors do we want? Hardened traumatized young people who only know how to act from anger or young people coming back who are on the road to healing & able to make valuable change in their communities by civic participation? They can be our future leaders. They can participate in creating a more inclusive, connected Los Angeles that does not discard people because of what they have suffered & includes them in decisions that will change our culture and city.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?": "Creative Acts is prepared to bring our Art Attacks program into juvenile camps virtually, if necessary, due to Covid-19 virus concerns. We are in talks with Los Angeles County Probation to use virtual technology such as Zoom to run classes that closely mirror the face to face program. Like many educators, we will need to revise our curriculum accordingly, but the core programming will stay the same: using activities and lessons rooted in the arts to help students find their voice, harness its power, and use it to become not only civically engaged members of their community, but also leaders in organizations that are tackling issues that directly affect systems impacted communities, such as our partners, March for Our Lives. In addition, programming online may provide the advantage of bringing March for Our Lives speakers into the class virtually who would otherwise be unable to enter the camps because they are under 18. We hope having communication with peers who have found leadership roles in their communities will inspire even more voter turnout and civic engagement from our students. In the unlikely event that virtual classes are not possible, Creative Acts is prepared to take the program to the same population outside of the youth facilities through local community centers and community-based organizations.",

    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "The immediate goals of Art Attacks are to increase voter turnout among incarcerated and formerly incarcerated young people, connect systems impacted people to organizations whose work directly affects their communities and help them gain leadership roles in these organizations, connect systems impacted youth with alumni of the program to facilitate dialogue in these communities, and amplify the voices of these too-long ignored populations. Through the LA County Probation department we were able to track voting records of our students in our pilot program and will strive to continue to do so. We also hope to work with Probation to employ a mental health expert who can compile an impact report of the program. And finally, we always create in and out surveys for our students. Because our students are minors, their records are expunged upon release and we are unable to track them through Probation long-term. However, we have a strong alumni community that we intend to build upon moving forward and together with the partnership with March For Our Lives, we have the best chance of being able to continue our relationship with our alumni and develop teaching artists from the pool of young activists and systems-impacted youth for a long-term impact."

    "Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.": "Los Angeles Police Department (Community Safety Partnership Division)",
    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "Project Blue recognizes that in order for communities to feel safe and secure, residents need to trust the officers that serve them. Identifying this strained relationship, the LAPD launched the Community Safety Partnership (CSP) division in 2011, with a mission to foster relationships with residents in housing developments and to support community/youth programs that address and reduce violent crimes. Focusing on Watts and the East LA neighborhoods of Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights and El Sereno, areas where gang activity/occurences of violent crime are some of the highest in LA County, our approach for positively transforming communities is based on involving youth as a conduit to inspire intergenerational and systemic change. Due to the lack of safe, organized after-school activities for kids residing in these communities, Project Blue supports officer-led outreach programs where officers and kids can engage together and actively forge relationships through coaching and mentoring.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "According to the CDC, there are several approaches that can support communities in reducing youth violence, two of which are mentoring and after-school programs. Project Blue believes that utilizing these strategies as part of implementing our pillars with a “whole child” approach will positively impact communities and lower violent crime rates and gang activity throughout the city, particularly in Watts and East LA where we currently focus our efforts. Our experience with both the public and private sectors has guided our approach to investing in what we believe is most effective: long-term engagement in young people’s lives with partnerships that can create consistent and safe environments where kids can develop purpose and resilience.",
    "If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.": "We’re grateful to partner with the LAPD CSP division on our program model. As part of their mandate, officers assigned to the CSP are encouraged to work with existing local youth outreach programs or create their own, where there is a need or interest. Through these programs, officers can actively and directly build relationships with youth, and the community as a whole, through coaching and mentorship. However, due to funding constraints, CSP programs often struggle to provide enough resources for all participating youth, such as equipment, registration costs and academic supplies, which creates challenges for officers to focus on running the actual program. Through our partnership, we ensure each program receives the resources they need so they can create the biggest possible impact.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project?": "Pilot project or new program",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "Project Blue believes that police officers have unique skills and experience to partner with kids and communities to create positive and transformative relationships. By providing financial and organizational support, we actively facilitate the good work that police officers do in their communities to create and ensure safety and opportunity for children and their families in inner cities. Project Blue was created by LAPD officer Steve Robinson and entrepreneur Janet Crown, founders of Crown Robinson Family Philanthropy, who seek to create private-public partnerships that enable creative solutions to complex social issues. By creating program models like Project Blue, and with symbiotic partnerships like with the LAPD CSP division, officer-led programs can strive to develop the “whole child” and achieve the highest possible positive impact. We believe our approach will guide at-risk children through developmental challenges and build resilience, academic and athletic confidence.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "We emphasize continuous and measurable growth. We believe that by identifying goals, creating trackable metrics and collecting data, program leaders can identify areas where they are succeeding in achieving their goals and where they need to improve. We measure our success based on how each program implements and meets our goal to impact the “whole child” through our five pillars: (1) promoting resilience and understanding the ability to adapt to adversity, trauma and significant sources of stress; (2) encouraging academic achievement and emphasizing the importance of education and setting/maintaining goals; (3) facilitating parent/guardian engagement so that adults remain committed not only to the children in their care, but also to our holistic community-building approach; (4) positively engaging police officers in the community to make a deeper impact on all residents; and (5) educating both youth and parents/guardians on health, wellness and nutrition to promote a lifetime appreciation for making healthy choices and prioritizing their physical and mental well-being. We ensure that programs have the resources and tools to implement/measure each pillar, such as research-based resilience curricula, access to shared best practices, and more. We also collect and analyze data on positive police-community interactions, which demonstrates occurrences in the community that capture how residents measure their safety as a result of their interactions with officers in the program.",

In 2018, members identified food justice as a shared priority. They have developed a report card to assess local supermarket quality, conducted evaluations of more than 20 stores across South Los Angeles, and awarded seals of excellence to those exemplifying high-quality service to their communities. The work has been supported by the LA Food Policy Council, which passed the 2019 Good Food Zones motion, and facilitated the LA County Board of Supervisors’ unanimous approval of the Improving Supermarket Quality motion, calling for the Department of Public Health to address food quality and food safety issues.

In Los Angeles County, almost 30% of low-income residents struggle to find quality food. Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color are two to three times less likely than affluent or white neighborhoods to have access to nearby grocery stores with affordable and nutritious food, putting residents at disproportionate risk for obesity, diabetes, and other life-threatening illnesses like cardiovascular disease and cancer. UPAS is effective at helping communities organize, find their voice, and demand equitable access to the countless opportunities to be found in Los Angeles. The organization is proud to support its members’ ongoing fight to put healthy food on their family’s tables.",

UPAS has partnered with the American Heart Association and California FreshWorks, an experienced, mission-driven lending network that supports businesses working to increase access to healthy food in California’s low-income communities. Both partners will support UPAS members in hosting meetings with six high-quality operators to raise awareness of the impact of food injustice, the needs of local residents, and the California FreshWorks investment program. Members will share their success in rallying community support for businesses showing commitment to, and care for those they serve. Direct partnership with grocery store operators will be supported by grassroots petitioning of LA County leadership to propose a motion to support the FreshWorks program and provide incentives for investment in healthy food enterprises in the city’s low-income communities.

    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "This project is envisioned to elevate the marginalized Ethiopian, other African and African-American communities from abysmal levels of unhealthy lifestyles, by successfully establishing and maintaining an annual “Marathon Running Program.” This project will provide an accessible opportunity for youth/adults in these communities to train for & successfully participate in the annual Los Angeles Marathon. The immediate goal is to secure a winning grant of $100K from this grant challenge in the “Play” category, and to establish the structure & management of a 26-week running program from September 2020 through March 2021. This program aims to register, train/prepare, and enable 50-100 members aged 16 and above, to complete the 2021 LA Marathon race, free of charge. The long term goal of this project also purports to meaningfully contribute to measurable health and wellness improvements within these affected communities, and will collaborate in various efforts to fight obesity, diabetes, mental health and other diseases. Outcomes will be tracked through the various means/ways used to disseminate information throughout these communities, recruitment and registration of participants committed to a myriad of activities, as well as traditionally keeping attendance, depth of participation records (e.g. types & hours of participation per member, before/after program lifestyle changes, etc).

Whereas sports in general has been universally recognized as a unifier of communities, nations & the world; it has also been proven as a guarantor of physical, mental & emotional health/wellness. Even though black people have historically achieved excellence in a variety of sports for decades everywhere; the marginalized Ethiopian, other African & African-American communities who have long established themselves in Los Angeles, have unfortunately been left behind in their youth & adult sports participation levels. Disabling facts showing lack of participation in healthy/active lifestyles have led to alarming levels of obesity, diabetes and other diseases, but my project can contribute toward ameliorating this scourge. There is a strong need to encourage these marginalized communities to participate in a newly established marathon running program, which plans to diligently train them to successfully complete the Los Angeles Marathon.",

    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "Las Fotos Project was created for teenage girls to have the freedom to express themselves and explore their identity. When our students completed our creative programs, they asked ‘what next?’ We knew that simply pointing them toward careers in the creative economy would be setting them down an inequitable path of racial and gender roadblocks. Our students' question inspired a vision for a youth-centered photography studio where teen girls can begin to dismantle roadblocks by building their professional and economic capital. In the midst of COVID19, we are refining our vision to support recovery and healing by launching a model that supports students, offers affordable services to the community and partners with some of the 200,000 women business owners in L.A. This mutual-aid effort will invite creatives to work in the studio through low-cost memberships, offer e-commerce product photography packages and provide opportunities for students to receive paid on-the-job training.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.": "Through the youth-led photography studio, Las Fotos Project is applying its community-centered engagement approach to build a mutually-beneficial and sustainable site for youth, artists and small businesses to support one another and recover from the economic fallout caused by COVID19. We envision the Las Fotos Project’s youth-centered photography studio as both an incubator and accelerator, ensuring that more teenage girls have the skills and support to pursue lucrative creative careers while also providing local creatives and small business owners with accessible and culturally-responsive photography services. LFP defines success as working to reduce income inequality by removing barriers for emerging artists to access professional networks and launch entrepreneurial business models for the creative economy. We will identify women-owned businesses seeking to build their online presence to provide affordable e-commerce and marketing photography services, creating an economic support loop between women and girls. We are also currently developing service pricing models that will be accessible and affordable to the local community. The outcomes of our activities will be measured through pre/post-program assessments for students, pre/post-surveys for venue renters, and client satisfaction surveys. Our regular Youth Advisory Council meetings and LFP member meetings will also create an avenue for direct feedback on the effectiveness and accessibility of our business model.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "We launched a small photography entrepreneurial training program for teen girls in 2017, providing our students opportunities to work as hired photographers with the support of professional photographer mentors. The program grew from 7 girls generating $24,700 in revenue during our first year to 15 girls generating $38,800 in revenue our second year; there are currently 23 teen girls learning everything from event photography to post-production. We attribute the successful growth of the program to the guidance of our strong women of color leaders and mentors. Additionally, Las Fotos Project has always been a youth-centered photography nonprofit organization; there is a power-sharing between adults and youth—where youth are entrusted with the big issues and encouraged to drive our gender equity work with their feedback. This power-sharing gives youth a seat at the table, value, and respect, while still receiving support and guidance from adults through a generative learning process.",
    "Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.": "Las Fotos Project supports the agency of teenage girls from communities of color by creating an environment that both values and validates their lived experiences. They are mentored by and create images of people who look like them, living lives that may be similar to their own lived experiences. We've seen how this environment empowers girls to self-advocate and explore their own cultural, community and professional identities further. Our new studio will allow us to continue this work on a much greater level by creating a venue where girls from the community can launch into their creative careers by providing their families, neighbors and local small businesses with the relevant photography resources they need to rebound and flourish.",

What potential donors lack is a reliable partner, an organization with a well run, well directed volunteer base who can be counted on to pick up food at the appropriate time and location, transport it to a facility for sorting, and then deliver it to one of a network of agencies who will make immediate use of it. We are that solution. This is what we have been doing for years, with a proven track record, and we are ready to go big. We thank you for supporting the Hollywood Food Coalition.",

Our goal is to triple the amount of food we rescue and share to 18,000 pounds a week by July 2021. Securing a facility separate from our existing kitchen, with dramatically expanded storage space, will be a key first step towards the creation of our 'Food Hub.” Additionally, while we have over 40 available volunteers (“Pickup Artists”), as well as paid drivers, all poised every day to rescue food, we lack the organizational infrastructure to expand this program (which involves recruiting, training, and 'dispatching' food procurement and rescue teams, dealing with complexities of scheduling, etc.) . Building our capacity requires us to professionalize our program by hiring our first Director of Food Procurement (who would also be tasked with the job of locating additional sources for food, and introducing these donors to our program). Finally, we lack a refrigerated truck, which dramatically limits our ability to travel 'far afield' to rescue and share food (for fear of food spoilage): adding such a vehicle to our 'fleet' would go a long way towards expanding the scope, scale, and thus the success, of our efforts. Our vision of success is ambitious: success, for us, means that nobody goes hungry in the city of Los Angeles. Success would mean replicating our 'hub' model, in community after community after community, until our entire city's food needs are met.",
    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "Over 11% of the people living in Los Angeles county are food insecure. Well over one million of our neighbors do not know where their next meal is coming from: this is the largest 'food insecure' population in the U.S. Structural economic disparities push people into poverty. Wages have remained stagnant for decades, while the cost of housing, food, and medical care have skyrocketed. The result is that the nation's western breadbasket sees many of its own citizens go to bed hungry. To make matters worse, more than a third of the food in this country is thrown out. This food ends up in landfills where it releases methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. The fact that Los Angeles faces problems of both food waste and food insecurity is tragic, but it is a problem that can be solved: the HFC has created, and hopes to expand, mechanisms to address all aspects of the problem.",

All our food is donated from grocery stores, restaurants, farmer’s markets, and TV/film productions. We rescue up to 6,000 pounds of food a week - in excess of our needs - and we share our surplus with fellow social service agencies that don’t have funds for their own meal programs. We often hear from them that the food we provide helps their client's dig into the work of 'getting better'. For battered women, at risk teens, recovering alcoholics, 'recovery' is not possible when you are hungry. We possess the knowledge, the relationships, the volunteer base, and an understanding of the logistical challenges needed to create LA's first “Food Hub”: where food can be stored, repackaged, repurposed and ultimately shared throughout LA.",

The Workshop Series we request support for highlights the core of these endeavors. The dancers we serve typically train at local dance Studios, but aspire to build their pre-professional and professional careers in dance. Making this advancement, however, can be a confusing, not to mention expensive, undertaking for dancers and families. Because our Workshop classes will be instructed by Master Teachers with connections to esteemed Universities, pre-professional Conservatories, and professional Companies throughout the US, the experience will aid in bridging the gap between local dance Studios and higher-level institutions. The coaching, mentorship, and exposure participating dancers will receive are bound to yield ample opportunity for growth and success.",

In the short-term, we strive to unite various dancers from throughout LA, allowing young, like-minded individuals to build relationships with and gain inspiration from one another, while simultaneously receiving coaching from Master Teachers in a uniquely intimate and nurturing environment. For the long-term, we trust the Workshop Series will help build the futures of participating dancers by granting them the opportunity to make lasting connections with Master Teachers closely affiliated with the Nation’s leading dance Conservatories, Universities, and Companies. In turn, the Master Teachers will have the opportunity to recruit these ambitious, able dancers for such higher-level places of education and work."

Given our 15-year history of connecting Angelenos through dance, many of whom are eager for this dance season to resume, it’s important that we respond by relaunching and adapting our offerings to fill the voids left by the current climate. Dance DTLA is also an entryway for new participants of all ages and backgrounds, dancers and non-dancers alike. This is especially true due to the declining performing arts attendance. According to the Irvine Foundation, this decline is partly due to people from diverse communities having historically not felt welcomed at cultural venues, as well as facing barriers such as cost and travel time. This is significant because arts engagement has been shown to bridge the gap between social, demographic, and economic lines.",

The coronavirus pandemic has changed how volunteers can engage with nonprofits. As a result, we have created a toolkit -- the COVID-19 Assessment and Response System or CARES -- embedded as part of our platform that helps every nonprofit community assess, respond and recover from the horrific impact of COVID-19. This pandemic has been a triple-whammy on nonprofits -- hitting them hard in their main fundraising or performance season with the cancelation of numerous events, reductions in service-delivery revenue and the final big impact is the removal of most volunteers from their business model.",

The social sector in Los Angeles includes more than 12,000 volunteer-engaging nonprofits who directly impact more than 4 million people -- employees, clients and volunteers -- while having an indirect impact on the entire population of 13 million. A healthy volunteer ecosystem positively impacts all causes, including the most difficult social issues, from homelessness to equitable education.

Both the stories and data are maintained in real time to show the impact of COVID-19 on individual organizations, causes, sectors and an entire community's social sector. A second phase is using the tool to recruit prospective volunteers to COVID-19-friendly ways to help now. A lot of people are looking to help, but until now have felt helpless in finding online, remote or socially distant safe ways to help. In the third phase of the approach, residents can use the tool to give to nonprofits or campaigns within a community to help the sector recover.

Following recommendations from the LA County Health Department and the CDC, PTN suspended all in-person services on March 16. In the weeks since, PTN’s multi-disciplinary teams demonstrated considerable ingenuity and creativity, quickly mobilizing to implement alternative early education, therapy, and parent support measures to ensure continuity of care for our clients. PTN migrated nearly all of its individual and group programs to a telehealth platform, including all of our Best We Can Be early intervention and parent support programs. In addition, our team developed relevant and digitally accessible resources for families isolated at home that can be accessed for free via our website and YouTube channel. The services PTN provides are vital to long-term developmental, academic and social outcomes for children with and at-risk for developmental delays and disabilities.

More than 600,000 young children live in LA County, 1 in 4 is at risk for developmental delays, and an estimated 51% live in poverty. The 2018 California Children’s Report Card, from Children Now, indicates 1 in 4 California children is at risk for developmental, behavioral, or social delays. Such conditions result in impairments in physical functioning, learning, language or behavior that affect cognition and long-term academic outcomes.

    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "At PTN, we believe every child, regardless of their socioeconomic status or diagnosis, can achieve their fullest potential. Yet, timing is critical. During the early years of life, more than 1 million new neural connections are formed every second. These connections build the foundation for lifelong learning, behavior, and health. When delays are identified early and families have access to early education and therapy services, the challenges these children face can be mitigated, and in some cases, overcome. Because of this incredible impact, early education is at the core of what we do. Nearly 60% of our clients are under age 5. Thus, expanding and enhancing early education is vital to our mission and those we exist to serve. We are uniquely equipped with an experienced, multi-disciplinary team of licensed early childhood educators and therapists, state-of-the-art facilities, and most importantly, more than 20 years of high- quality services with demonstrated outcomes."

LA County's rate of illiteracy is one of the highest in the nation, and that is directly linked to lack of literacy resources. With the lack of libraries or literacy resources, children to read or imagine what could be when they don’t have access to books from an early age directly has a direct impact on a child’s ability to succeed in life, both in the short term and throughout their lifetime.",
    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "The Literacy Club’s sole purpose is getting books into the hands of children, doing whatever it takes, and at no charge. For instance over the last 2 weeks (March 15- April 3, 2020,) we have donated over 10,000 books to children throughout the nation, however and primarily in Southern California. Each child receives on average 7-10 books for their age group, and we are able to donate books for every age level."

I also find that these same people are not educated on the ease of paying payroll taxes and how little it really costs. I feel education can go a long way to solving this problem. Many people say that household workers don't want to pay taxes, and I believe this is not true. Everyone wants to feel a part of the community.

A study conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts found that students from low-income communities who had high engagement with the arts were 5x more likely to graduate high school and 3x more likely to receive a bachelor’s degree.

Often, these cuts lead to the loss of arts education in entire schools, despite research showing that high arts engagement in elementary school increases the chances of low-income students graduating high school and makes them three times more likely to receive a bachelor’s degree. By providing these materials and lessons, our program helps to close gaps left by budget cuts, promoting social, economic and racial equity in the communities we serve and helping to ensure students’ future success. Additionally, each year the average teacher spends over $900 a year on supplies.

Being financially secure was identified as a top priority. According to the Center on Education and Workforce at Georgetown University, it is projected that 5 million jobs will go unfilled by 2020 because of a lack of “postsecondary credentials.” Future Ready helps break the cycle of poverty by giving underprivileged kids the tools they need to earn a high school diploma and be prepared for their futures with a concrete plan.

Two-thirds into the semester, her professor noticed a pattern of absences and, out of concern, contacted my office. Anna had been living between a friend’s couch and a homeless shelter. I connected her to emergency resources, but it was too late. Anna failed all of her courses and lost her financial aid. As a result, Anna dropped out this semester.

    "What is the need you’re responding to?": "Physical education (PE) standards mandated at federal and state levels are an integral component of a student’s learning and overall well-being. Yoga instruction strengthens a student’s fundamental motor skills, teaches them to learn and follow patterns, and gives opportunity to participate in group activities, meeting PE standards. Yoga also offers dynamic tools for building conscious awareness of the self and social-emotional well-being. This practice allows students to build a connection with themselves in a way that they feel empowered to connect to others and their environment. In the context of special education (SPED), these connections can be cultivated to grow social and academic inclusion opportunities, giving students tools to fortify the skills that empower them to participate. While there is a need for best practice guidelines for yoga in SPED classrooms, there is virtually little or no research on how to be most impactful with yoga instruction in SPED classrooms."

We will: (1) Work within what RAP currently offers; (2) Utilize a Citizen Science approach (e.g. block parties) to increase visibility of the parks to be viewed as a locus and neighborhood hub for communities. Progress will be measured with data capture from wearable devices, and newly developed culturally-tailored mobile applications. The app will serve as a conduit to integrating this large, multi-sectoral approach across LA. We will be assessing secondary outcomes (e.g. obesity, hypertension, resting heart rate), the impact on neighborhoods (e.g. safety, beautification), and the larger positive impact on youth as citizens of LA; (3) We will use validated measures for observing where and how people use park space to examine current trends in RAP park usage (e.g. number of people using parks, how they are using them, and where they are spending their time in parks). At the end of the ten-year initiative, we will also help the City of Los Angeles assess their key performance indicators: 1) Programs; 2) Sports promoted; 3) Participants; 4) Coaches/staff; 5) Funding; 6) Outcomes (Overall participation increase over the 2019 baseline, % of parents that consider their children have a better lifestyle (physical and mental) because of the YSP, % of children reporting increased interest in new sports).",

Physical activity participation can play a key role in the prevention of noncommunicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer. Research also points to associations between physical activity and delayed onset of dementia and improved mental health. Despite this extensive knowledge, participation rates are low, and physical inactivity a global pandemic. Globally, over one quarter of adults and approximately 80% of adolescents do not meet physical activity guidelines. The United States is not immune, with only approximately 25% of children and youth, and less than 40% of adults sufficiently active. Within California, many of these trends are the same. Furthermore, physical activity levels in California drop among underserved, girls, and minority populations, thus, to improve public health, we need to find ways to get people moving.",

Food insecurity means having limited, uncertain, or inconsistent access to the quality and quantity of food that is necessary to live a healthy life. Having sustained access to enough food is tied to positive social, physical, and mental health outcomes.” Los Angeles is one of the largest concentrations of food-insecure populations - over 2 million Angelenos face food insecurity, translating to 1 out of 5 individuals in the county. The high costs of housing and transportation, coupled with a 20% poverty rate, have contributed to these hunger statistics.

For decades in California, school library funding has been ignored, resulting in neglected and pitiful libraries. Many schools have books that are outdated (books from the mid- 20th century with Caucasian characters only), tattered and dull. Many children in low income areas do not own books in the home and the public library may be too dangerous to get to alone (or closed on a Sunday when they could go with their families.) Access to books must come from their school libraries. In order for children to do well in school, they must read well and to read well they must read a lot.",

The risk of homelessness increases for youth of color, LGBTQ youth, and youth with a history of system involvement (i.e foster care, juvenile justice system). Without housing it is difficult to maintain employment, stay in school, or focus on long-term goals. Housing is the solution to homelessness yet to afford an apartment in Los Angeles ($1,340), Angelenos need to earn $53,600 annually. A typical renter in Los Angeles brings home $44,000 per year.

Public funding priorities aside, the cities are inundated with data which ends up causing more work and reduce productivity. And residents feel like they just aren't being heard so they give up communicating with the cities; these are the 'silent majority'.

    "Why is this project important to the work of your organization?​": "Since 1990, Ryman Arts has empowered 34,000 high school students, filling the gap of high quality arts education programs in under-resourced communities. Ryman Arts serves approximately 600 students through its core program and 1,500 more through outreach efforts, annually – with students coming from over 190 zip codes. This free, 1½-year-long, out-of-school program integrates rigorous fine arts instruction, college and career counseling for talented youth who are most deprived of arts education opportunities. Ryman Arts conducts outreach each year and is familiar with strategies and partnerships that will assist us in creating more access to the program. Additionally, Ryman Arts has established strong partnerships with creative businesses, cultural institutions, and community partners and is in a unique position to execute this project.",

Most women facing a cancer diagnosis tend to isolate themselves or refuse to talk about the diagnosis in an effort to protect their loved ones. They continue to try to hold down jobs, mother their children, and maintain a household while enduring a grueling chemotherapy or radiation regimen. In the time we have been doing this work we have learned of the unique challenges facing women with cancer and created our current services and programs to alleviate many of the difficulties these women face, difficulties aside from their cancer. We currently serve almost 1,000 women and have been serving women with cancer and adding to their overall wellness for 15 years. Although most women with cancer seek traditional treatment, many leading oncologists now believe that wellness and holistic healing is a critical part of the cancer journey.

Women who come to us are looking to empower themselves to participate in their own healing process, They are considered “at risk”, and we know virtual services will allow us to serve them now and in the future without further risk to their health. Our women need the healing tools they learn at every workshop, day retreat, overnight retreat and individual session. In order to continue to provide this support in the upcoming years, we have begun the process of adding virtual programming, which is the focus of this proposal. Attending a virtual session means there is no additional risk to a woman’s health by being around others. We are working with our talented facilitators on transforming workshops and day retreats to be held live and on online platforms.

Although we started implementing this programing because of the current crisis, we now want to grow it so that even when the world is back to normal we can continue to serve more and more women who cannot for health reasons join our events attended by dozens of people. We will measure success by how many women we can share our mission with and how many women we can begin serving from that number. We will create online goals for attendance of each program and work to making sure we serve as many as we can per program. An example of this is that we intend to serve as many women with an online retreat as we would with an in-person retreat, and success would be meeting that goal. As the virtual programming will also support our efforts in collaborating with other organizations, for profit and nonprofit, that serve women with cancer, part of our success will be measured by an increase in those relationships.",

Additional impact includes allowing women who are already being served by us to continue services while undergoing treatments and surgeries that might keep them away from public gatherings for a specific amount of time. Additional impact is giving an opportunity to those we serve to continue building relationships with other women with cancer, a big factor in overall wellness."

Healthcare access meant preventive services that weren't enough because nutrition was consistently ignored as medicine, itself.

We believe we're the only nonprofit in the country dedicated exclusively to putting teen mothers into college and ensuring that they have the resources required to graduate.

The students enrolled in OJS are among Long Beach’s most vulnerable and are representative of the educational crisis facing the state of California. Although the graduation rates have significantly improved in Long Beach for our population, many who graduate are not properly prepared to pursue a college education. As evidenced by recent results of the 2017 California Assessment of Student Progress Test, less than 30% of economically disadvantaged 11th grade students in Long Beach meet or exceed expected standards in English and only 8% score proficient or advanced in Math (California Department of Education, 2018).",

In 2010 the program served less than 20 students, in the 2019-2020 academic year we served 146 students. Our expansion goal is to increase the number of students served to 300. The program uses a two-fold approach to assist our vulnerable students as they work towards the goal of a college degree. The first is to fully prepare current high school students for challenges they will face gaining admission and preparing to begin their college education and to support them throughout this stressful process. Once college admission is obtained, the program is there to provide individualized case management to meet the specific needs of each college student. Our students outperform other students of similar socioeconomic backgrounds in their attendance at four-year colleges immediately following high school, their college graduation rates and their overall persistence rates in higher education.",

Our experience shows, time and time again, that when kids become involved in the design and creation of a mural in their community, they develop a vested interest in using and maintaining their communal spaces.

The South LA region has very limited resources for tech/tech enabled businesses, which we believe have the ability to be economic equalizers. By providing mentorship, community, support, access to funding and other key resources, we believe we can empower entrepreneurs to create sustainable businesses, new jobs and generational wealth.

BYOM gardens will fill remnant land spaces in Los Angeles, not only creating a physical community, but reducing carbon footprint and increasing pervious surface cover in areas which are the most polluted and in need. Many low-income communities in LA are minority-inhabited, and disproportionately polluted.

Therefore, our goal for the first year of BYOM is to reach 100 families, at least 10 of those being through our rent subsidy program. We will pay landlords to develop remnant land within their complexes into community gardens in which residents can contribute volunteer hours, for which they will receive compensation directly to their rent payment portal. BYOM will be able to earn profits through the rent subsidy program by hosting farmers markets directly out of the garden, where produce will be sold at slightly above cost.

Our focus is always at the root cause of these issues, and thus the events and material we create reflect that.

To buy is to trade, to shop is to connect, and to walk in a city is to enjoy the complexity of the space. To address this increasing disconnection from place and food around us, we have created BYOM: a garden, a coffee shop, a zero waste grocery store, and most importantly, a community.",
