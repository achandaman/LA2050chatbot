We anticipate showing gains in all five measurements in nearly 100% of the students we serve. The CoachArt Student/Coach Matching Tool will pair approximately 30,000 additional students (an 8,800% increase) affected by chronic illness per year with adults who will engage them in an 8-hour arts or athletics mentorship. The health impacts of those mentorships will vary based on the disease and the activity. For instance, among cancer patients, 1 hour of art therapy causes statistically significant reductions in 8 out of 9 qualitative symptoms. As for athletics, 1 hour per day of sports reduces depression among youth by 8%.",

According to the National Math + Science Initiative more than 46.8 million new jobs will be created by 2018, of which one million STEM graduates will be needed to meet demand. Additionally, STEM-based careers are expected to outpace traditional job growth and increase by 17 percent over the next decade. However, a 2010 report released by the United States Census Bureau illustrates the widening achievement gap for minorities, with only 19 percent of African Americans and 14 percent of Hispanics aged 25-29 having earned a Bachelor’s degree. Our organization will address this disparity and introduce young men and women to STEM though the creation of the LA’s Promise Technology Academy at John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior High School, and West Adams Preparatory High School. We will expose a combined 90 students (40 per school) to STEM-related after school activities. All LA’s Promise Technology Academy participants will attend coding and app development classes, lectures from guest speakers, and/or field trips organized in partnership with Televisa, Univision, Fox Studios, Direct TV, Google, and others. Participants will chronicle their experience through a dedicated blog, video journals, and on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. In addition, participating students will be provided with Math and Science tutoring to ensure they excel in the classroom. Use of a digital badge platform such as Mozilla’s Open Badges will track the progress of students and unlock achievements as skills are mastered within each respective curriculum. Activities will be scheduled after school throughout the upcoming 2016-2017 academic school year."

The unfathomable experiences of a person in interaction with the scientific and technological advances as experienced in advanced heart failure are novel to patients and their families, and unknown to health care professionals (e.g. http://ampersand.gseis.ucla.edu/federica-raia-book-on-relational-medicine-reveals-doctor-patient-collaboration-2/; http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/q-a:-federica-raia-and-life-with-a-new-heart ). For the last five years, Dr. Federica Raia conducted an ethnographic and participatory research study on the practice of high-tech modern medicine in collaboration with the advanced heart failure cardiologist Dr. Mario Deng, director of the UCLA Integrated Advanced Heart Failure-Mechanical Support-Heart Transplant Program. Based on ethnographic work and the analysis of recorded medical encounters following patients with their doctor encounters for two years, the authors provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the practice of high-tech modern medicine (PS More information about this book can be found in http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9065). What Dr. Raia discovered in her research revealed that the marvels of technology mandate the practice of Relational Medicine, i.e. the integration of body, science technology and personhood into one singular framework of practice and that this integration can mean the difference between life and death. For the thousands of heart failure patients that receive treatment at UCLA Reagan Medical Center, their often prolonged recovery can critically diminish their physical, mental and spiritual health.",

Most of us—do-gooders, funders, policy makers, early childhood advocates—believe that the path to improving early childhood care is to encourage and fiscally support low-income children in attending preschool and then improve the preschool workforce through professional development. The problem is that the vast majority of the most vulnerable children do not, and will not, go to preschool. In Los Angeles, 80% of the most vulnerable children attend license exempt friends, family, and neighbor care (FFN). They hang with grandma, play with aunty, or are watched by the neighbor down the hall. In LA County there are over 200,000 children in this type of care.",

FFSC recruits and receives referrals for youth from schools, community based organizations, libraries, DCFS and neighborhoods located in Service Planning Area 6. Students from SPA 6 face a number of economic, environmental, and social challenges that have a direct impact on their wellbeing. Within SPA 6 there is a strong prevalence of foster care, gang-related activity, juvenile delinquency, and youth victimization. These issues create profound instability in our families and communities, fueling high school drop, unemployment, and immense incarceration rates. As a result, this continues to make it nearly impossible for our youth to meet their basic needs, reinforcing the vicious cycle of poverty and suffering in the way of their success. FFSC wants to break that cycle by empowering children labeled as “disadvantaged” or “at-risk” to become leaders for themselves, their peers and their community. SCLP believes in every student’s capability to succeed when given access to all the necessary tools. SCLP consists of 5 modules that are 8 weeks in length. The modules expands our youth knowledge base by providing significant exposure to real-life work experiences, hands-on activities that challenge their decision making process, intense cross-cultural and intergenerational volunteer projects both locally and abroad. The components of SCLP are: Education, Financial Literacy, Leadership (includes Civic and Service Learning), Social Justice/Advocacy and Health. The objectives for SCLP: Assist students in developing specific skills needed for effective leadership, high graduation school and career paths; Provide students with a process for examining pertinent issues facing their communities and knowledge of those issues how to make change; Increase students understanding of and appreciation for cultural diversity; Provide opportunities for students to apply the knowledge and skills learned through meaningful community service; Students become ambassadors of their own learning so they can better educate and teach their peers and community (train the trainer). This allows them to personally develop through SCLP and have access to tools and resources that not only helps students to apply to college, but also prepares them to succeed in life. Upon completion students receive a certificate and have a graduation.",

Through our collaborative & strategic partnerships we are able to engage community leaders, stakeholders and clients to help us identify our success and any gaps. In order to evaluate SCLP we survey our students as well as their parents and teachers. A series of in depth surveys allow for us to evaluate the progress of our students in a holistic manner.

This transition presents us with a new set and scale of challenges that require us, as a region, to “fill in” the gaps by making smarter investments in early and lifelong education and retraining; by developing forward looking infrastructure systems and physical spaces; by inspiring a new generation of civic and social stewards; and by strengthening our innovation capacities and global connectedness. Once implemented, LA’s next Strategic Plan for Economic Development will interlink the region’s economic, physical and networking assets, and fill in the gaps in a way that unconditionally bridges us to the Information Age.",

Grand Park is dedicated to creating a safe and enjoyable space for everyone with family-oriented, no-alcohol large-scale events (4th of July, Día de los Muertos, New Year’s Eve) with no major incidents or arrests among crowds as large as 45K people. With 24/7 security, well maintained clean toilets, ample drinking water, a splash-pad for adult and child water play, food and beverage choices, the park is dedicated to offering a safe, clean and comfortable place for LA to play. Grand Park also features a children’s playground specifically designed to stimulate social, motor and cognitive skills through play. Providing children safe places to play is critical in their development and future success. The current lack of permanent shade structures, however, limits the use of some areas of the park. Creating more shade will increase the use of the park; provide UV protection, spaces for performances and exhibitions, and more activities for children and elders. With 2.6MM+ Angelinos living more than 1/4 mile from a park and Latino, African American and Asian Americans less likely to live near parks, Grand Park provides critical access to the 31K residents (US Census) (71% non-white) 500K employees and 10MM tourists that live/work in and visit DTLA. A growing body of research from UCLA, the CDC and the Surgeon General supports a direct correlation between access to parks and physical activity (play) with important psychological and social health benefits: relieves symptoms of depression/anxiety, improves mood and enhances psychological well-being. Parks, gardens and other natural places such as Grand Park make for more livable communities, opportunities for recreation, exercise, stronger social ties and a sense of community and increase social capital bringing diverse communities together to share experiences. Grand Park is a work in progress, constantly responding to the needs of our public, reflected in the evolution of public programs that build on each prior event and improvements made to the physical infrastructure to accommodate the growing audiences that have identified Grand Park as their favorite place to gather and play.",

Minecraft thus represents a unique opportunity to scale a gateway to STEAM-related interests, identities, and skills that can be implemented across a student education pipeline. This project leverages Minecraft to 1) bring more kids into coding and technically sophisticated forms of gaming, and 2) sharpen our understanding of the relational and cultural supports kids need to develop STEAM interests as they move from K-12 institutions to higher education systems.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your work.": "We use a number of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the camp. One measure is engagement: are kids actively engaged in our coding challenges; do they log in to our servers whenever possible? Another measure is a sense of belonging: do kids feel part of a community to which they are actively contributing and in which they are recognized as an important participant? A third measure relates to the mapping of our curriculum to the Next Generation Science Standards. Based on these specific learning outcomes, our coding challenges serve as performance-based assessments measuring the extent to which a kid has learned a particular coding skill or set of skills. We also gather daily data from our counselors on their interactions with the kids, noting learning challenges and successes and capturing information on how kids are doing with each of the different coding challenges. Counselor data is summarized and reviewed daily so that modifications to the curriculum can be made as needed.",

The benefit of Ambulante's amorphous quality is that the feedback informs our perpetual iteration. Each time we do another screening we have the opportunity of learning from hundreds of distinct locations and when we go back to the same communities we have the feedback that is specific to that neighborhood. Our goal would be to have an overall positive evaluation of the contribution we bring and how we fulfill our deliverables.",

At all of our outdoor events passersby stumbled upon us and sat down and became involved in the subject at hand by asking a question, giving us their email. This kind of informal access point is crucial for nonprofits to significantly expand awareness outside their already dedicated base. By including people who are left out of the conversation the conversations are elevated and civic participation in the subject is exponentially increased. Our events connect people to share one communal experience, people from very different classes, age and orientations. Since we work with over 40 partners our scalability is where our full potential can be unleashed."

Summer Melt is that period between graduating high school and starting college, where students who are college eligible or who have already been accepted to college, will not enroll in classes for the fall semester.

The Ripple Effect will create a 3-week summer bridge program for graduating high school seniors to address this educational concern. Focusing on first generation college students, the bridge program will focus on developing basic math and English skills, and college readiness skills (time management, study techniques, financial aid, creating schedule of classes, etc.). These sessions will be taught by an English and a math teacher, and by a college counselor. Students will also participate in weekly field trips to different cultural and/or educational events and/or locations. These field trips will be chaperoned by volunteers and the college counselor.

California has historically drawn some of the largest numbers of immigrants of any state in the nation and most recently (and particularly since “The Surge” at the border last summer) the highest number of school aged immigrant and refugee children. Unfortunately, as we all witnessed on the news and in the media, their reception has not been the kindest in many places. Sadly because of the stigmas and the stereotypes associated with this population, they are often dismissed as if somehow these children are less worthy of an eduction and come somehow predisposed to be cheap manual labor. There are many institutional reasons why we know this to be true, but as with anything at Casa Libre, we choose to address what is in our control, which we have found to be the value, or in this case, lack of value, placed on education over employment in many of our immigrant communities. We want to put an end to the vicious cycle that this disregard for education creates, not only for individuals, but for the entire City of Los Angeles. When education is undervalued, students underperform. When students underperform, schools lose funding. And when schools lose funding, our communities suffer at every level, whether it be socially, economically, environmentally, health related or otherwise. Our study hall we will provide a safe space and access to technology for kids that sometimes live in one bedroom apartments with up to six people. Here they will be able to feel their educational endeavors validated and have their confidence boosted so that higher education becomes a tangible possibility where it may have been only a dream or worse still, a source of shame. For new students, we will provide an environment of full immersion, sensitive to all the cultural and linguistic nuances associated with these students, but which will empower them learn a new language with ease."

This belonging and the active participation in civic life are important values in and of themselves. But what happens when disaster strikes? In particular, what happens if you are poor, without insurance or financial security and live in a vulnerable area? Then the lack of community and belonging as well as financial means can spell complete devastation. When your apartment burns down, you want to know your neighbors, be part of a larger community network and prepared to respond and then recover after the smoke clears. The effects of disasters large and small are exponentially worse for poorer communities. Families struggling to pay rent are less likely to store resources, own a car and have a safe space to stay in an emergency. At the same time, low-income communities are much more likely to be struck by disaster in the first place, considering housing conditions, including construction quality, heating and electrical wiring, is often not up to standard. ARCLA is acutely aware of these disparities as the vast majority of fires we respond to are in vulnerable neighborhoods where underserved residents (most of our disaster relief clients) find themselves in an extremely precarious position after a residential fire, often teetering on the precipice of homelessness and abject poverty.",
