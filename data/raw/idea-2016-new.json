These interactions enhance the personal and communication skills of users, which significantly contribute to residents' sense of safety and emotional/social support. PPS’ three project goals are to: 1) increase resident capacity, building up their advocacy for increasing access and resources to parks and open spaces; 2) increase the rate of resident and partner organization volunteerism at parks and open spaces; and 3) increase communication between government, CBOs and residents on the use of vibrant park spaces within Drake and surrounding communities.

The information obtained through neighborhood surveys will be used to inform decision makers on how best to prioritize park funding as well as create new private and public partnerships that invigorate the currently disenfranchised, marginalized Drake community. Resident leaders will present their findings to City Council and advocate for equitable park funding in low-income communities; taking on a systems approach on how our parks are used, maintained, and sustained. Resident leaders will inspire their neighbors to get involved and join them at the community action day at Drake Park, where residents will program park activities, and showcase their newly found partnerships.

Getting into college takes a lot of time, effort and knowledge about just which colleges you should apply to and which ones may accept you. It’s an overwhelming process culminating in a decision that has long-term effects – college graduates have a lifetime earning potential of $2,927,000 compared to $1,193,000 among high school graduates (Harrington et al, 2010). No pressure, right? Now imagine you’re the first one in your family to apply for college, your parents have an 8th grade education and do not speak English very well, and your school’s college counselor is responsible for serving 700 students. That’s the reality for many of the kids we work with at YPI, and the lack of knowledgeable support results in 'undermatching' where, for example, a high school valedictorian accepted to UC Berkeley who opts to enroll in community college due to concerns for cost.",

Many people have implored Homeboy founder Fr. Greg Boyle to “start a Homeboy Industries in our city”; his gentle response is that Homeboy cannot and should not be the “McDonald’s of gang rehabilitation, with billions of gang members served.” We believe that Homeboy’s programs work precisely because they were developed in and by the community they serve. Approximately a quarter of our senior staff is comprised of program graduates, giving Homeboy unprecedented cultural competence and many opportunities for formal and informal peer mentoring. Skills training and mentoring are proven effective reentry models.",

Providing college counseling geared towards creative students pursuing arts and/or broader liberal arts programs is especially challenging because it requires an individualized, intensive, intuitive approach that is time consuming in order for it to be effective. In the more resourced schools and communities of Los Angeles, many students have access to a vast network of college coaching support, be it through the school itself with offerings itself, or through access to a number of private college counselors and private tutors. There is a remarkably different picture, However, in the public schools of resource-challenged communities. In these schools, support beyond the most basic college application requirements is rare. With Cultivating Creative Students (CCS), Wisdom Arts Laboratory of Pasadena collaborates with Prep for Art (College Counseling for Creative People), to provide rigorous and innovative college counseling resources for creative students who would otherwise lack the financial resources necessary to have access to this more sophisticated network of support .",

Unfortunately, these contributions are often overlooked because of the communities' reputation for low academic achievement from under-resourced schools, cycles of poverty, unemployment and under-employment and neighborhood violence. The proposed project was developed in response to a recent increase in violent, gang related activity among east side middle school, and early high school youths. Many local youth who have been identified as 'problematic' because of their behavior or neighborhood affiliation are being lost to gangs, and drug use because the local parks, community centers, or schools lack the resources or training to support them and they often find themselves pushed out of programming with nowhere else to turn to but the streets. Several of the youth at CALÓ YouthBuild found themselves in similar situations before reclaiming their lives and education. This project will allow CALÓ youth to put into practice the leadership development, green building construction and engineering skills, and arts and culture training provided to them in the YouthBuild program by designing mobile solar powered generators to power arts and STEM programming to younger versions of themselves. Students will work with CALÓ and YouthBuild Charter School of California staff to develop arts and STEM programming to take to underserved young people in local housing projects, parks, community centers, and schools. Programming would include music instruction, full band rehearsals, music recording and production, introduction to solar photovoltaics and energy efficiency, introduction to engineering, STEM careers, construction basics, leadership development, mentoring, and recreational community movie screenings. The proposed project will make LA the best place to play by using youth driven solutions to address serious community issues in an innovative way, integrating the arts, culture, and technology into programming that fosters community and promotes healing."

    "Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place to CONNECT?": "Once the envisioned GRID infrastructure becomes operational, the most visually and physically impacting characteristic to the citizens of Greater Los Angeles will be the immediate reduction of trucks travelling to and from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. These impacts will mostly be felt on freeway networks directly north and northeast of the ports. The most non-visual impact will be the privately financed contribution to building transportation infrastructure (estimated at $18B) that will create 10's of thousands of jobs, primarily jobs in the fields of construction and alternative energy infrastructure. We apply jobs created as a CONNECT LA benefit because GRID's proposed infrastructure are within the very neighborhoods we hope to grow jobs; adjacent to workers reducing commuting times required to travelling to and from work. But it's the byproducts of the GRID Project that will have the most impact to CONNECT LA. For historical reference, in 1984, Mayor Tom Bradley and Olympic Games chief Peter Ueberroth forged an agreement to suspend deliveries of containers on trucks travelling to and from the Ports of LA and Long Beach. The move was a success and the 'LA Traffic Miracle' reported to have reduced LA's freeway traffic congestion by over 50%. The advent of freight pipelines is envisioned to become the 2nd iteration of freeway rights of way to increase efficient traffic flow for the Greater Los Angeles mega-region. However, freight pipelines with not have the impact freeway construction has had over the last 70 years. Natural effects of efficiency for freight transportation are anticipated to greatly enhance other aspects of our regional transportation transportation networks (i.e. cars, bike lanes, walkways). GRID proposers anticipate this new iteration of urban transportation (controlling truck populations) will have significant knock on effects to the point that more pipelines routes will developed. Motivations will be concession revenues, carbon tax credit opportunities, continued support from environmental, social justice groups and labor unions, and business interests primarily from the construction and renewable energy sector.",

    "Please describe your project proposal.": "GRID's Project proposal begins with the need for an independent evaluation of the GRID Project, ideally from regional stakeholders in the form of political, business, labor, environmental, and social justice quarters. GRID seeks support through its affiliation with the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator and its surrounding community stakeholders to include education, and neighborhood councils.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​": "GRID has already succeeded claiming its proper place in Greater LA's history as 'The' Pioneer in regional holistic 'Cleantech' solution RE: the container supply chain in this 21st Century. GRID first presented its vision project at the Transportation & Infrastructure Convention in Washington D.C. in early 2011. In late 2011, GRID was the very 1st transportation mega-infrastructure proposal to be given a resolution for support by Sierra Club. In 2012, GRID was rejected by PortTechLA for membership & also rejected from the newly opened LA Cleantech Incubator (LACI). So GRID moved on & was joined in support by LIUNA the LA/OC Building Trades, the International Brotherhood of TEAMSTERS & the Equipment Operators Unions. In mid-2013, GRID re-applied to LACI & was accepted. GRID's next goal was to obtain an independent evalution of GRID's viability & received assistance from California University of Northridge School of Engineering who assisted GRID to submit a grant application for Transportation Infrastructure Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER). GRID succeeded in receiving letters of support from key elected officials to include members of congress Janice Hahn, Adam Schiff, and CA Pro Tem Senator Kevin De Leon. Unfortunately, the GRID study failed to win the grant lacking local support. At this time GRID's success can only be measured by the resistance GRID has experienced from entrenched interests. Without independent evaluation success to build is TBD."

She recalled that she was sharing a memory about how safe and engaged she felt attending their youth center. Her younger sister asked her, “What’s that?” She realized that her sister had no relationship with the center. Other young people talked about how their safe place was a liquor store around the corner until they got harassed by gang members or cops thinking they were gang member. Some sections of Los Angeles youth are provided with spaces that help them proactively contribute to the community while in others they are not. We specifically see this challenge in the City Terrace neighborhood of East Los Angeles. There is a huge opportunity to ignite a neighborhood of healthy relationships through a pilot called the Zone.

    "Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?": "Mendez High School, Roosevelt High School, Hollenbeck Middle School",
    "Please describe your project proposal.": "To increase college access among Boyle Heights youth, we will create a peer mentoring program, in which local college students would mentor college bound, but first generation high students at two key schools, Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez High School and Roosevelt High School, giving them support as they prepare to apply to college. In turn, those high school mentors, will mentor at risk middle school students at risk of not graduating, to increase their motivation towards school.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​": "Success will be defined by both immediate and long term outcomes. To gauge short term success, we will distribute surveys school wide on our two high school and one middle school campus before starting the program to gauge college awareness. Surveys will be distributed after the program has been completed and data will be analyzed to note for statistically significant increases in awareness. For our target cohort of the 40 high school and middle school students, they will complete pre, mid, and post surveys that focus on college awareness, college attainment, self esteem, and hope for their future. Additionally, post program focus groups will be completed for all cohorts: college, high school, and middle school. For long term success, we will analyze school wide data obtained from our schools. We already have baseline data from previous school years from the three target schools on attendance, behavior, graduation rates, course performance, and college enrollment. We will use this data to gauge the school wide impact on our program’s presentations and school wide initiatives. In addition to the school baseline data we have, there is a documented need for this type of programming in Boyle Heights. Boyle Heights’ 69% dropout rate underlines this predominantly Latino community’s high-need. And although the C-S model at Mendez has helped double the graduation rate in the last four years, local youth continue to face many barriers to graduation and college success."

It is used to assess to basic concept development of children in the age range of 2 years 6 months through 7 years 11 months. It is used to measure comprehension of 308 foundational and functionally relevant educational concepts in 11 subtests or concept categories: colors, letters, numbers/counting, sizes, comparisons, shapes, direction/position, self/social awareness, texture/material, quantity, and time/sequence. Of the 11 subtests, the first six compose the School Readiness Composite (SRC).

Consequently, California children are subjected to curriculum that is inappropriate for their developmental level, setting them up for early failure and burn-out at a time when they are defining themselves as learners. This has been a great setback for children in low income communities where scripted lessons that fail to measure the dispositions needed for school and life success take precedence over creative experiences and engaging intellectual challenges. Our goal is to support classrooms that nurture tenacity, curiosity, flexibility, creative thinking, and democratic values that provide children with the best preparation for academic success and responsible citizenry.",

For the last five years, Dr. Federica Raia conducted an ethnographic and participatory research study on the practice of high-tech modern medicine in collaboration with the advanced heart failure cardiologist Dr. Mario Deng, director of the UCLA Integrated Advanced Heart Failure-Mechanical Support-Heart Transplant Program. Based on ethnographic work and the analysis of recorded medical encounters following patients with their doctor encounters for two years, the authors provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the practice of high-tech modern medicine (PS More information about this book can be found in http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9065). What Dr. Raia discovered in her research revealed that the marvels of technology mandate the practice of Relational Medicine, i.e. the integration of body, science technology and personhood into one singular framework of practice and that this integration can mean the difference between life and death. For the thousands of heart failure patients that receive treatment at UCLA Reagan Medical Center, their often prolonged recovery can critically diminish their physical, mental and spiritual health.",

Access to community garden plots is in high demand and often too expensive due to fee hikes for water and the density of agricultural production associated with higher median income neighborhoods with higher percentages of white residents. Lack of access combined with health and environmental inequalities have dire consequences. 20% of LA County residents are obese and the poverty rate is 15%, one of the highest in the country.

The challenge is twofold: there is a void in access to and training for services that holistically address a survivor's mind, body and spirit in order to activate long-term change. And, for the past forty years, the field has been so entrenched in meeting the immediate needs of survivors with limited resources and support that staff are themselves, suffering from high levels of vicarious trauma. A 2009 study in Violence Against Women found that 70% of participating domestic violence advocates met the criteria for clinical levels of post-traumatic stress disorder. As a result, despite extensive personal sacrifice from front line workers in the field, the services that survivors receive oftentimes fail to meet the overwhelming need in both volume and quality. This challenge has been amplified in Los Angeles, where in 2015, the LAPD announced that reports of sexual assault had increased by 21% and domestic violence incidents had increased by 33%."

To this end, we have three primary impact outcomes and measurement strategies. First, our coParenting curriculum is designed to increase awareness of the importance of coParenting and introduce coParenting best practices which will be measured by pre- and post- surveys of workshop participants. Second, the coParenting app will directly lead to more effective coParenting behaviors and reduced conflict measured by our proprietary coParenting scoring algorithm. This score draws from real time user data to measure collaboration, conflict levels, and coParenting optimization. Lastly, #coParenterProject is designed to build a community of young people from coParenting families to mitigate stigma, social isolation, and to share information. Measurements will include total number of community members, total number of questions asked, average user time on platform, and user surveys.",

    "In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place to LIVE?": "There are almost 3 million Angelinos in an active coParenting relationship with an additional 200,000 Los Angeles residents joining that community every year. And as the exponentially larger millennial generation- many of whom opt out of marriage altogether- reach the ‘Age of Conscious Uncoupling,’ that number will surely skyrocket. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, high conflict divorce/separation is the second (out of ten) most common Adverse Childhood Event (ACE) which have been proven to lead to negative health, academic, and economic outcomes in adults. Conversely, children growing up with coParents who collaborate, cooperate and effectively coParenting, thrive. But catastrophic cuts to an already-overwhelmed court system have eliminated mediation, coParenting resources and self-help programs, leaving separating, divorced and never-married parents with few options for resolving conflict. This lack of resources force many Angelenos to manage conflict and every day coParenting issues on their own. Unfortunately, a disproportionate amount of parents end up litigating in court leading to advanced economic hardship for families as well as ACEs- which have documented connections to negative health, academic, and economic outcomes in adults. It doesn’t have to be this way. A family’s marital status does not, in and of itself, lead to negative outcomes for children. coParenter Project disrupts the cycle of conflict through three interrelated strategies. First, our project will deliver research-based coParenting education to 1,000 coParents through a network of community-based organizations. Second, we will distribute 5,000 free licenses of coParenter, a coParenting management and mediation platform offering family communication, scheduling and management tools, automated conflict resolution and live, professional coaching to help coParents resolve disputes, make agreements and make better, more informed decisions for their kids. Finally, #coParentingProject, a Twitter based learning network for children of coParents, will connect youth in coParenting families with each other, to mitigate social isolation, build a community, and share information and resources in a safe, anonymous environment. We anticipate 10,000 tweets between kids helping each other through this innovative, first-of-its-kind network. These three activities will directly address the LA2050 live metric of disrupting adverse childhood events and have wide impact on child and family well-being across LA County.",

Our Program is designed to educate and impassion youth to appreciate and respect the marine environment and introduce youth to a potential career choice in water safety.",
    "Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place to PLAY?": "Southern California has a reputation for offering easy beach getaways all summer long. In fact, thousands of youth within Los Angeles never see the beach at all, and a few who are lucky enough to make a trip may actually be more fearful of the waves than ready to surf. The opportunity for youth to play in the ocean, to swim in the waves without fear, and to be able and ready to help someone else in trouble in the water – that is what this amazing program offers. The Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program operates for six weeks during the summer months at two open water locations – Cabrillo Beach (ocean) and Hansen Dam (lake). Each week, the youth are instructed in aquatic skills such as swimming, running and paddling, with the intent of instilling participants with confidence in their abilities in the ocean. Additionally, this program is designed to promote physical development and water safety. Youth are instructed in lifeguarding skills such as effective swim rescues, Community CPR and First Aid. Each week there are conditioning and competitive activities, such as rescue board relays, run-swim-runs, buoy swims, rescue can relays, run relays, and beach flags, with the intent of promoting teamwork ethics culminating to regional and national Junior Lifeguard competitions against other agencies. This grant will subsidize the costs to run this program and allow youth who normally would not be able to get to the ocean, have a summer to be on the beach and in the water, places they otherwise might never enjoy. The youth will be integrated into a program that builds social skills and mutual respect along with healthier bodies and strategies of water rescue, and do it in an environment with quality facilities and friendly, skillful adult instructors. In fact, a major positive element of the program is the student-mentor relationships that blossom, and the interaction of the youth participants with adult staff and the other older adults. The Cabrillo Beach Booster Club made up of retired lifeguards and other lifelong ocean water swimmers take part in organizing the Battle of the Beaches event for our Program. The Cabrillo Beach and Hansen Dam Lake facilities are among the top destinations for RAP year-round, genuinely vibrant facilities that receive extra care because of high public use. (Both facilities offer kayaking and fishing opportunities.) This program also includes field trips to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium located within walking distance from Cabrillo Beach and a trip to Santa Catalina Island, where youth can learn to appreciate and respect the marine environment first-hand. Most important in this program is the basic objective of teaching children to be safe in the water, to be able to rescue themselves and to immediately and confidently rescue others as well, making any beach or body of water safer for all in Los Angeles just by their presence. The Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program makes LA the best place to Play.",

RAP Aquatic instructors create a curriculum prior to the beginning of the program based on the United States Lifesaving Association, which is the governing body for all open water programs/agencies. RAP's program is divided into four age groups: 9-11/12-13/14-15/16-17. Staff set the same goals for all the different age groups. For instance, during the first year, the goals set for the younger group is to ensure water confidence in the surf and open water environment. By the end of the summer, all junior guards are to be confident in the following: Open water swim in ocean/lakes, Long distance swim and run, Run/swim/run time trials, Basic CPR-First Aid-swim rescues, and Competitiveness at meets with other open water agencies. Although each of our participants attend the California Surf Lifesaving Association regional event at the end of the summer, RAP identifies the strongest youth from our program to compete with over 40 Junior Lifeguard Agencies. The top five winners of each event move on to represent California and their respective agency at the United States Lifesaving Association - National Lifeguard competition. RAP has success stories of our participants winning Nationals. On the heels of these success stories, one of the outcomes of our Program besides life skills and conditioning is to also be a feeder into RAP's Lifeguard program. Many generations of our lifeguards began as Junior Lifeguards."

    "Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place to PLAY?": "The Compassion Games are designed to make our communities safer, kinder, more just, and better places to live, work and play. Touch somebody’s life! By participating, players are called upon to perform acts of service and kindness in our neighborhoods, on the job, in service-providing agencies, and wherever their daily journey takes them. The acts of service are organized service projects or simple acts of kindness to aid a neighbor in need. If a project already exists during this time, simply add it to the Compassion Games family and get more attention and support. Showing up in the most unexpected places, organizing in formations unseen before, expanding and deepening in ways no one could have designed, the Compassion Games is proving to be a license to dream and find new solutions to old problems. What’s more, the Games make it OK to do serious work and have fun while doing it. Inspired when Mayor Greg Fischer suggested his city of Louisville, KY was “ the most compassionate city until proven otherwise,” Compassionate Seattle took him up on it. Both great cities put their days of community service in the ring and the Compassion Games were on. It did not take long before other cities heard the same challenge. Santa Monica, Nashville, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, New York City, even Gurgaon India galvanized their communities and proved they knew what “coopetition” means. Santa Monica has been participating since 2013 and its City Council voted unanimously to sign and affirm the Charter for Compassion in September of 2013, making it the first city in LA County to do so and 4th in the state of California. LUSH cosmetics sponsored our compassion cards and media kits. From the promenade we inspired and promoted compassion all over our city. Reports were submitted through a crowdmap and data was collected. At the heart of the Compassion Games’ purpose is the belief that within each of us exists an innate, powerful, and ready kindness. We’re passionate about harnessing this kindness in service of “compassionate action”, defined as action motivated by the intention to alleviate others’ pain and suffering.

    "Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place to CONNECT?": "Save Spaces for Healthy Places will make South LA (SLA) the best place to CONNECT by motivating residents to get involved with the Community Plan (CP) process through Neighborhood Councils (NC). CPs reflect the needs and values of residents living in the community as it lays out guidelines for land use, housing, transportation, and business development. However, CPs, like those in SLA, are not always followed or updated. Of the three Community Plan areas in SLA, only one has been updated in the last 10 years. As a result, SLA has experienced decades of neglect from decision-makers and investment. This has resulted in residents feeling disillusioned and disengaged from the political process and believing that their voices do not matter. Neighborhood Councils are vehicles that can help SLA residents reengage since these are groups comprised of residents that the City recognizes as being the voice of the people. NCs and other residents can get involved in CP hearings, meetings, and other discussions so that they can advocate for equitable access to fundamental resources. Engaged residents can push for a responsible CP that ensures future developments will bring in safe parks instead of liquor stores; produce markets instead of fast food restaurants; and affordable housing instead of only high-priced condos.",

The global impact of the digital divide lies in how it compounds and deepens other social inequalities. For example, 80% of K-12 students need Internet to do homework, 90% of college applications are filled out online, and 90% of job applications are hosted online. An unemployed person who has Internet at home will be employed over seven weeks faster, due to availability of online job search platforms and advice, which translates into over $5,000 in additional income over a year.
