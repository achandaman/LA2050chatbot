    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Systemic racism impacts Compton's youth creating critical disparities in employment, earning potentials, and education. Compton's residents are 69.3% Hispanic, 27.1% Black, 22.3% White, and 13.8% Biracial (U.S. Census Bureau). Residents have an average median income of $38, 235 for men and $36, 632 for women, with a poverty rate of 20.6% (ACS, 2020). Only 62.1% of residents have a high school degree or higher compared to 79.8% of Los Angeles County (LAC). Only 9.3% of residents have a bachelor's degree or higher compared to 33.5% of LAC. STEM occupations continue to be the fastest growing within the workforce across the US (BLS, 2017). Despite comprising 27% of the US population, only 11% of science and engineering jobs are held by Black, Latinx, and Native American workers (NSF, 2018). Houses of STEAM was established to broaden opportunities for BIPOC students, address low earning potential due to lack of exposure to STEM careers and increase student numbers pursuing these careers.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Houses of STEAM (HOS) is a supplemental academic program for 50 K-6 Compton youth & their families to experience STEAM education through hands-on training, building projects, attending field trips and speaking with BIPOC professionals in STEAM career fields. A unique feature of the program is the inclusion of parents/guardians and other family members. The entire family is encouraged to participate, elevating the STEAM experience, creating opportunities for families to engage in educational activities, further cementing their knowledge and excitement of STEAM careers. The goal of HOS is to broaden STEAM opportunities for BIPOC students, increase earning potential through exposure to STEAM careers and increase student numbers pursuing these careers upon high school and college graduation. Yearly, HOS offers 17 STEAM learning experiences like Biosciences, Oceanography, Aerospace, Creative Arts, Mechanical Engineering, Math Education, Engineering, and Digital Technology. Learning experiences are facilitated by professionals in the respective fields. After attending a learning experience, students wanting more experience with a specific field will be directed to a professional mentor or online resource for further learning.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The great minds of tomorrow are in elementary school classrooms, but science is not. Countless elementary school children throughout L.A. County do not receive formal science instruction due to lack of funding in under-resourced communities. In fact, students in low-income communities are less than half as likely to have science programs in place in their schools. Social-distancing and remote learning challenges during the pandemic only further exacerbated learning loss and widened the opportunity gap for under-resourced youth from low-income communities. A 2021 report from the L.A. Education Recovery Fund found that wealthier children were able to better manage pandemic challenges by accessing supplemental programs (one-on-one tutoring, after-school programming, learning pods, and virtual therapy). Children growing up in poverty had limited or no access to additional academic enrichment support, further exacerbating pre-existing systemic inequities for low-wealth children of color.",

County. PS Science delivers high-quality science curriculum to TK-5th grade students (the vast majority of whom are Black or Latinx and 75% come from low-income families) at Title 1 elementary schools throughout L.A. County during the school year. Weekly lessons include 60-90 minutes of engaging science experiments and hands-on activities. Our instructors also provide customized teacher training and coaching, including instructional video lessons and email support. This service is in response to feedback from teachers, the majority of whom said they felt they were underprepared to teach science prior to being introduced to PS Science. Beyond our in-school programming, youth are engaged outside of normal school hours via weekly after-school Science Clubs, STEM clubs and Remote Afterschool STEM Enrichment classes with L.A. Unified School District; family science nights where parents and children work together to run science experiments from home or at school utilizing materials that accompany classroom lessons; spring break and our two-week-long S-TEAM Rangers summer camps; and summer enrichment opportunities through our partnerships with several YMCA locations, Great Public Schools Now and L.A. city parks."

Almost 2/3 of them are arrested again within 3 years. Barriers to successfully re-entering society include having little access to education, limited job opportunities, ineligible for public benefits, public housing and student loans. Their college applications are rejected at higher rates than their peers without records. Our gap between high and low income families is among the largest in the nation. Income is often not enough to meet basic needs with the average family of 4 requiring about $37k. Rising income inequality is driven by a job market that favors highly educated workers, and Black and Latino families are overrepresented at lower income levels. Homelessness also continues to grow: nationally, California has topped the list for the state with the largest homeless population for more than a decade. Lastly, 1 in 5 people in LA County experiences food insecurity.",

Things are expected to get much worse now that pandemic eviction protections have expired. According to Census data, in the LA Metro Area alone there are 246,000 households behind on rent. More than 80% are people of color. March 2023 had the most filings in a month since 2018. Prior to the pandemic, LA County landlords filed more than 40,000 eviction cases annually. It's estimated tenants lose by default in 40% of cases-meaning that tenants did not file a response within five days. According to UCLA's Luskin Institute on Inequality and Democracy, \"only a small proportion of tenants in eviction cases are represented by lawyers, compared to 95% of landlords.\" Each day some 207 people exit homelessness, but 227 others take their place. Prevention is the best way to end homelessness. Providing tenants with the tools to fight eviction is crucial to helping Angelenos maintain housing and avoid homelessness.",

The Debt Collective will focus on the technical construction of additional languages. ICLC will provide legal expertise and conduct e-filings and provide free legal representation for low-income tenants in Los Angeles. Both will use their existing collaborative networks and outreach teams to promote use of the Toolkit. All partners will use volunteer assistance in outreach efforts as needed, and ICLC will tap its dedicated pool of pro bono attorneys to represent clients and support the Tenant Defense Project team. Gary Blasi and Hannah Appel will continue to generously donate their time and services to the project.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The Tenant Power Toolkit is an existing project that is being expanded to include a more diverse language capacity. Currently, the Toolkit is available in English and Spanish. With support from LA 2050, it will be available in 12 additional languages. From July 2022 to April 2023, 3,568 total filings have been completed using the Toolkit, helping an estimated 9,634 people based on average household size. There have been 12,386 unique visitors to the Toolkit. ICLC has e-filed and served documents for 1,877 tenants in LA Count who qualify for a fee waiver. Each step of the project has built-in evaluation measures. The digital nature of the tool allows the Debt Collective to receive extensive data about how tenants are interacting with the tool. Feedback from community partners demonstrated that the Toolkit needed to be made available in more languages to better meet the needs of vulnerable tenants. Consequently, the partners are seeking additional funding to meet this need.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "This project will reduce homelessness by giving low-income tenants, regardless of English proficiency, the ability to fight illegal and wrongful evictions and stay housed. It is shockingly common for ICLC to see clients subjected to harassment and illegal eviction attempts by landlords who want tenants out so they can increase rents. Countless more don't reach us in time. The project will serve vulnerable, low-income people who would otherwise lack legal representation and the ability to file a response within the required five business days. Our project will help tenants avoid homelessness by informing them of their rights, providing them with a way to respond to eviction notices quickly, and connecting them to legal help they would otherwise not be able to afford. Short term, we will help low-income Angelenos at risk of eviction stay housed. Long term, the Tenant Power Toolkit will serve all counties in California, and will help to reduce homelessness throughout the state.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Tenant Power Toolkit is a collaborative project between ICLC and the Debt Collective that prevents homelessness by helping low-income tenants fight eviction. The Toolkit informs tenants of their rights and connects them with an attorney. The project involves three components: 1. Creation, operation, and maintenance of the Tenant Power Toolkit, a web-based platform that allows tenants to electronically serve and file responses to eviction notices. The tool prepares not only an Answer (a defendant's response to a legal filing) but also the paperwork necessary to obtain a Waiver of Court Fees, a Declaration of COVID-related Financial Distress, and a Demand for Jury Trial. 2. An extensive outreach and education campaign about tenants' rights and the availability of the Toolkit. 3. Free, full scope representation in LA County courts. According to a 2019 STOUT study, 95% of people facing eviction who have full scope representation have a \"high likelihood of avoiding disruptive displacement.\" Full-scope legal representation is the most effective way for a tenant to avoid eviction and possible homelessness. Currently, the Toolkit is available only in English and Spanish. This request will expand the project into 12 additional languages to help better serve LA's diverse communities. Expanded language capacity includes Chinese (traditional and simplified), Korean, Armenian, Russian, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Arabic, Farsi, Tagalog, Hebrew, and Urdu."

    "summary": "LA traffic deaths are the highest in two decades and dying at record rates are our K-8 students, who are especially at risk, given many of their schools are long wide, fast streets. An effective solution is Walk to School Day activations (Safe Streets Slow Jam), where community members walk students to school and slow traffic with large, attention-grabbing signs and performances. These events create safer streets, educate the public, and give parents critical data that can pressure City officials to implement long term infrastructure change.",

    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 2,000",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This is an existing project, an activation we've done multiple times. In 2018 in LA's Historic Filipinotown, we conducted a Slow Jam along Temple Street where volunteers held large signs and visuals to help students safely cross a major street intersection. And in 2019, at two different elementary schools, volunteers wore superhero outfits to help students safely get to school. And in 2021, we partnered with the City of LA on a school streets activation, where we closed up a school's drop off/pick up street to cars and opened it to children walking, biking, or scooting to school. In all of these activities we surveyed parents, asking them to provide feedback on changes to their perception of safety, commitment for safer driving, and any infrastructure changes they would like to see around the school. And overwhelmingly parents have shared their support of these programs and clearly attributed them to greater safety. We anticipate doing similar parent surveys for this project.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In LA, walking to school exposes students to life-threatening traffic dangers. Busy roads and distracted drivers all increase the chances of hitting a walking student. Intersections are particularly hazardous, given many LA schools are along wide, high-speed commuter roads with poor infrastructure, like missing crosswalks, crossing guards, and lack of traffic signals. And so the results are not surprising. The leading cause of death for LA elementary and middle school children are car crashes. And it is overwhelmingly happening in immigrant and communities of color. And as our streets become the deadliest they've been in two decades, more families are driving to school even if it's a few blocks. Over the past 50 years, we've seen a 37% drop in K-8 students walking to school. All of this only furthers congestion, increases greenhouse gas emissions, and inflames conflict amongst and between parents and school staff during hectic drop off/pick up hours.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "For this project, we will organize multiple Safe Streets Slow Jam activations, where students are encouraged to walk to school and accompanied by parents and the community to help slow traffic. The program involves three components: First, pre-event preparations involve collaborating with schools, parents, and City officials on logistics. This includes determining the route, identifying safe crossing points, recruiting parents and volunteers, and educating the public about the activation. Second, on the designated day, volunteers gather at meeting points/intersections by the school. They are provided with safety materials, like reflective gear and stop signs. Volunteers will wear costumes, carry large signs, and other theme-based tools. Upon arrival at school, there will be a celebration with parents, school, and City officials to acknowledge the students' participation and their commitment to walking. Finally, a post-event evaluation is crucial to assess the program's impact and to inform City officials on safe street needs. Surveys will be distributed to parents, and participants to gather insights on their experience and suggestions for infrastructure improvement and pedestrian safety. Through this big tent approach - engaging students, parents, drivers, and City officials - the hope is that our Safe Streets Slow Jam activations will promote safe and active transportation, foster a sense of community, and instill lifelong habits among students and their parents.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "For this project, we measure success through three outcomes: First, our students are able to walk to school safely and envision a radically different streetscape. By presenting a safe, fun, and community-centered ownership of streets that are often resigned to cars, students are able to think more critically about transportation and the role of infrastructure and community health and dignity. Second, we educate the public on safe and responsible driving. And as parents engage with one another, outside their cars and amidst a fun activation, we build greater accountability and trust. Furthermore, parents will be armed with best practices and knowledge for organizing future Safe Streets Slow Jam activations Third, a final outcome is empowering parents and the school with data showing community demand for safer streets and improved safety from the activations. They will be able to leverage this data to pressure the City to create more permanent changes and/or fund future activations."

This model will provide over 150 in-person hours of career development training, individualized internship planning and placement, and 1:1 mentorship over two years. We take an asset-based approach to student success, pairing career exploration with student strengths. We actively seek feedback from our students and volunteers about the program's content and what is most useful for their success, centering their experience in program design. We cover topics often excluded from career development, including authenticity in the workplace and navigating unwritten rules in addition to the foundational skills of resumes, cover letters, and interviewing. \"ANY has been so instrumental for my professional career development.

Even so, only 21% of low-income, first-generation college students receive bachelor's degrees within 6 years of enrolling in college (The Pell Institute, 2021). With economic empowerment and mobility tied closely to one's education level, supporting these students through college and first-time careers is now more critical than ever. Today's colleges have limited resources to help students build career competencies, with a national median ratio of students to career staff of more than 1,500:1 (NACE, 2020). In a survey of recent graduates, 50 percent said they hadn't applied for entry-level positions in their field because they felt they were unqualified (Cengage, 2021). For first-generation college students, these service gaps result in a median household income 27 percent lower than their peers with college-educated parents (Pew Research, 2021)."

Over 70 million people have dysautonomia worldwide. One of the most common forms, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), can be extremely disabling. An estimated quarter of people with POTS are too ill to work. Treatment is complex but can help significantly, yet many lack the funds and the knowledge required for adequate care. Patients struggle to provide for other fundamental needs due to illness. The number of dysautonomia patients has grown exponentially as an estimated 67% of people with long covid have dysautonomia. We have members of LADN who are homeless and those who spread out medicine to make it last. Many rely on family for financial support; not everyone has that. The LA dysautonomia community needs community & financial assistance.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "LADN serves a growing population of 160+ dysautonomia patients and caregivers. To increase knowledge about treatments and to combat the isolation of illness, LADN hosts support groups, educational workshops and speakers, a peer network, and social gatherings and provides educational materials and recommendation lists. LADN will launch a financial grant program to support dysautonomia patients financially this October. We will take applications for reimbursements of dysautonomia-related bills and are considering expanding to offer grants to support living expenses. Eligible bills will include treatments from MDs and hospitals as well as other health practitioners such as acupuncturists, mental health therapists, and physical therapists. Medicine (over-the-counter & prescription), electrolytes, compression gear, health monitors (i.e. heart rate, blood pressure, & cerebral blood flow velocity), and medical travel expenses will also be eligible. Dysautonomia experts are rare, and patients are often required to travel to receive adequate care. Because dysautonomia affects so many systems of the body, treatment is complex and requires multiple doctors and multiple costly treatments. Treatments are often \"off label\" or experimental and getting insurance coverage can be difficult. Altogether, access to life-changing medical treatment is behind a paywall. LADN intends to help provide access over the wall for dysautonomia patients struggling under the financial burden of illness.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA is home to a huge population. As an estimated 70 million people have dysautonomia (a pre-Covid stat - an estimated 67% of long covid sufferers have developed dysautonomia), a significant number of people in LA suffer from dysautonomia. Dysautonomia is typically an invisible illness, but it is no less disabling. POTS, the most common form of dysautonomia, predominantly affects women. Many women in LA are suffering invisibly from dysautonomia and struggling with basic needs. Disabled women are too often forgotten and maligned by society. Supporting dysautonomia patients in LA is supporting disabled women. LADN's grant program will lift up dysautonomia patients, allowing them access to medical care. This access to medical care will enable patients to live healthier lives and help many to reenter the workforce. Medical care access will help ease the financial burdens faced by dysautonomia patients, helping them to pay for the roofs over their heads and the food on their plates.",

We will measure its impact quantitatively: number of patients awarded grants, number of grant applicants, financial amounts awarded, and number of health-related services accessed; as well as qualitatively: reports from grant awardees on the grant impact on their health & lifestyle and types of medical care accessed. Based on these measurements and surveys of the general dysautonomia patient population, we plan to evaluate whether bill reimbursement is an effective system or if the program would be more effective through means such as lump-sum awards for demonstrated need and grants for general living expenses."

Research has started to illuminate the compounding factors and structural oppression that drive these disparities. However, less attention has been given to specific ways that women have been excluded from upward mobility in professional settings, such as the lack of access to professional training, life skills development, and mentoring. Even when these opportunities exist, Black women are not typically in positions to take advantage of them, thus limiting their chances to earn fair wages and compete on level ground with their counterparts.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "City of Los Angeles",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Los Angeles has 450 parks and recreation facilities that feed the soul, health and community pride of its residents. In the face of climate change, LAPF is creatively implementing new landscape practices to preserve public parks and greenspace. Current park landscaping relies on non-native species that grow quickly but won't survive water rationing, higher temperatures, infestations and fires. It's time to start designing our parks for the future. Trees and plants combat urban heat island effect, remove particulates from the air, sequester carbon, and retain rainwater. They also yield social benefits such as improved park utilization, mental and physical health, and community beautification. Our work aims to rectify early city development that created inequitable park, tree and shade distribution in low-income communities and communities of color. Together, we can create beautiful, climate adapted, drought-resistant parks using native species that foster biodiversity and save water.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If funded, the Miyawaki Expansion Project will launch a new era in Los Angeles' community park experience that centers the human experience of being in nature even in the most concrete-dense areas of the city. These three forests are just the beginning, with a total of 100 Park Forests planned by 2030. Our goal is to scale the Miyawaki model throughout the five regions of the Department of Recreation and Parks, creating systems-change in how we re-forest and re-habitat Los Angeles with native plants, animals, birds, insects and reptiles. Alongside this project, LAPF will build the capacity of its Commonwealth Nursery in Griffith Park which will cultivate native plants in a hyper-local two-mile radius, creating a seed to plant pipeline that will provide native species to the city's parks at no cost. These gardens will become centers of education for residents of the city, as well as Parks staff who will learn about native plants, water conservation and new models of landscaping.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The pilot Miyawaki Forest in Griffith Park is a 1,000 square foot circle composed of 145+ native plant and tree species. It was designed to test the model in Los Angeles, providing insights into species selection, planting design, water use, maintenance and replicability. Over the past two years, LAPF's Nursery Director carefully monitored plant survival rates, the introduction of non-planted species, water use, plant height, width and health, plant growth patterns, and tree and plant placement. At 6-month intervals, we conducted plant census and growth events and captured data in a spreadsheet. We also observed the presence of birds, bees, ladybugs, lizards and western toads in the forest. The new forests will be monitored and evaluated in the same way. It has been stunning to see what can happen in just 24 months using this densely planted method that forces plants to compete with each other for sun, while creating inter-dependent root systems that use water extremely efficiently.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "LAPF is seeking funding to create three new Miyawaki Forests. This method uses dense, multi-layered, intensely diverse but hyper-local plantings that grow ten times faster than traditional forests. They have small square footage requirements, low-water requirements, a central walking path and become fully established in just three years. LAPF planted its demonstration Miyawaki Forest at the Bette Davis Picnic Area in Griffith Park in June, 2021. Today the forest is fully grown and is one of the few Mediterranean Miyawaki gardens in existence. Its 146 native plants were installed in one day and today the tallest of the Toyon trees is 17 feet tall! Since the plants create a self-contained micro-system, it requires very little maintenance and water. As a pilot, we codified learnings and best practices that will inform replication and scale of Miyawakis throughout the city. We're now identifying park-poor areas with low tree canopy that will benefit from this accelerated greening effect, along with increased biodiversity, heat mitigation and forest bathing. We're also looking to experiment with different models, such as installing a Miyawaki in a highly urbanized Pocket Park, creating a highly curated forest with signage for native species for educational purposes, and experimenting with a habitat-based riparian garden along a body of water. Most plants will be grown from seed at LAPF's nursery in Griffith Park."

    "summary": "This grant will directly support a recruitment and activation to implement the Marathon Kids program in targeted areas in Los Angeles; the program will be free of charge to enrolled schools. The program consists of curriculum and content to implement before, during, or after school running programs for youth ages 4-18, many of which complete over four marathons over the course of a year. With this funding, numerous Title 1 schools in the L.A. area will be set on a path towards long-term whole health, for a lifetime.",

    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA County will be different because we are breaking down barriers and making health more accessible for many youth that are not currently able to prioritize their whole health due to the many hurdles they face. Some of these hurdles include financial restraints, time restraints, and simply not being exposed to positive health programming. Studies show that academic performance is enhanced when students start to prioritize their health through consistent movement, and they pass the positive effects on to their family members at home. Oftentimes, we see parents, siblings, and extended family members getting more involved in their communities and spending more time outdoors after their youth enroll in our program. LA will benefit by having more families engaged with the community and showing up for events, volunteering, and enjoying public spaces more often- all of which are indicators of a healthier lifestyle.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Currently, 60% of youth in the U.S. do not get the recommended amount of physical activity per day. A staggering 80% of youth in California aren't meeting this need; we are on a mission to move that needle. More youth than ever are currently suffering from an emotional disturbance or addictive disorder; we know that a program like ours greatly improves mental health as well as physical health and other aspects of youths' lives. Oftentimes, health programs are inequitable due to having an associated cost; we provide our program free of charge and intentionally target Title 1/high needs schools to make whole health more equitable and accessible for long-term positive effects on youths lives.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "This grant will directly support implementing our program in specific areas/schools that do not have the budget or resources currently available for a program like this, therefore making health more accessible and equitable. Our program helps to break down barriers to access and education not only for physical health but also for mental, socio-emotional, academic and other areas of youths lives. Increase in screen time and increase in mental health disorders are at all-time highs, particularly since the Covid-19 pandemic, and by coming in and implementing our program we are directly going to be able to intervene and put these youth on a path towards a bright future. We are able to offer supplies such as tablets, technology support, incentive items such as running shoes from our partner Brooks Running, and other things that so many youth would not otherwise have access to. Through research, we have found that positive reinforcement and celebrating achievements is hugely impactful on youth as they often do not get the praise deserved for a job well done; we activate for milestone and finisher celebrations to provide this positive reinforcement and encouragement to help make positive effects be long-lasting.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We measure success in many ways at Marathon Kids, such as our finisher survey that asks around 20 questions to participating coaches and parents of youth. These questions ask about particular barriers faced, what they enjoyed/did not enjoy about the program, how it effected other areas of their lives, how we can improve our implementation, etc. In 2020 our MK Connect Tech app was developed, which measures what schools we serve, if they are classified Title 1 or on a free/reduced lunch program, # of youth served, # miles logged for individuals/schools, retention rate, gender, and age. These statistics are helpful when we are going in to recruit for new schools, working with existing schools, and identifying gaps to potentially fill. For this project, we will target and recruit 6 new Title 1 schools in Los Angeles for year 1, in which we will serve approximately 4500 new youth. We will activate in at least 2 community events in which we will host families of enrolled students.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We seek to measure the impact of our affordable housing, which would be supported by this funding, through engagement with tenants via our onsite staff and ongoing tenant activities. Through these, we have collected a number of anecdotes and sharing from past and present tenants for whom affordable housing has been a lifeline, which are supported by wide-ranging research to support the positive impact of affordable housing on individuals, families, and the community at large. As one of our tenants noted, \"Living here in affordable housing has helped us tremendously. I live close to where I work...If I had to pay for a market rate apartment here in Pasadena it would be beyond my means. Living here has also helped my friends and my brother who have been through some difficult challenges in the past. They have been homeless or at risk of homelessness. Beacon Housing has not only provided me with a place to live but an opportunity to build a better future.\"",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Research from USC Price Center for Social Innovation found that 48% of surveyed households in LA spent more than half of their income on rent and utilities, with Black and Latino households more likely to be rent-burdened. High rent forces households to cut back on basic needs such as food and clothing, which can lead to long-term decrease in quality of life. Having affordable housing can have a significant impact on breaking intergenerational poverty by encouraging financial stability, reducing mental stress, enhancing health and healing, and providing a safe place to nurture learning and community development. As one of our former tenants shared, \"[Having affordable housing] was a respite. It was the support that we needed. We were low income, and couldn't afford a lot of things. But by the grace of God, [we were] able to afford a place to live as we were going to school and getting a career. I have graduated with my masters and been blessed by God with a good job.\"",

Our properties demonstrate how small to mid-sized multifamily housing can be preserved as affordable housing to serve as both a lifeline and a more readily-executable, community solution to the current crisis. With continued increases in maintenance costs, Beacon Housing relies on fundraising to cover needed major renovations to ensure the continued safety of these projects, as well as to find cost-effective ways to expand the number of affordable units available. The projects we require funding for include: funding for repairs to walking decks, stairways, and other retrofits necessary to meet the requirements of California ordinance SB721 to enhance public safety relating to decks, balconies, and other external elevated structural elements in multi-family residential units; repairs and replacements to existing plumbing system; and undertaking the retrofit necessary to bring a Junior Accessory Dwelling Unit up to safety code, so that it can serve as an additional unit of very low income housing.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our main focus is to provide a safe, stable and comfortable living space for residents in our buildings, all of which are in LA County. To ensure the continuity of this needed service, we need funding to ensure compliance with ongoing legislative changes relating to multifamilies, making all needed repairs, and taking all essential steps to enhance safety at our buildings. In the short term, this project will enhance safety and functionality for our existing tenants while also creating a new unit. In the long term, we hope to demonstrate through our properties that smaller-scale affordable housing projects can be financially feasible and a viable, locally-driven solution. Given the complexity of the current housing crisis, a variety of approaches and models beyond traditional affordable housing development must be considered."

The 1960s saw a pivotal moment in the gay civil rights movement as the LGBTQ+ community rallied against police raids on known gathering spots such as the Black Cat Tavern in Los Angeles.This resulted in the first Pride parades, which increased mainstream visibility and awareness of the injustice and discrimination experienced by the LGBTQ+ community. The HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s brought new challenges, devastating losses of life, and continued stigma and discrimination.

LA County's 244,000 small businesses are cornerstones in their communities; they create local jobs and combat income inequality. Yet despite this important impact, entrepreneurs-particularly women and people of color-face steep systemic barriers to accessing the capital they need to start and grow a business. Women and entrepreneurs of color regularly face lower loan approval rates, smaller loans and higher borrowing costs for bank financing than their white male counterparts, even when they have similar credit histories and business types. The Federal Reserve finds that business owners of color pay interest rates that average 32% higher than what white business owners pay. These systemic barriers can discourage aspiring entrepreneurs from making the leap to starting or growing their own firm. This results in a less innovative entrepreneurial ecosystem and inequitable access to a crucial wealth-building opportunity.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In mid-March 2023, we completed a pilot session of the Back to Basics series in both English and Spanish, targeted for LA-based women entrepreneurs. We engaged 99 participants; 89% were women of color. One month after the series, participants shared feedback via an online survey. A majority (80%) of respondents reported seeing or expecting to see an increase in their business revenue and profits after employing what they had learned. About half (55%) had set up separate business banking accounts, and 40% had already increased their customer base; 22% had hired at least one new employee. Respondents also reported feeling more confident about evaluating loan terms, filing taxes and increasing savings. Perhaps most importantly, 78% of respondents said their financial-related stress had been lowered. We continue to follow up with participants to assess their progress and learn how else we can help. We will build on these lessons learned as we expand the program to welcome all genders.",

This knowledge will help them successfully start and grow stable businesses, access capital as needed, create quality jobs and increase financial security for themselves and their employees. Long term, we believe entrepreneurship is key to decreasing income inequality and increasing financial stability. We will continue to expand our programming to reach more entrepreneurs and further increase access to business capital and support. As we focus on supporting those who have been historically blocked from this access, including women and people of color, we envision an ideal LA County where current and aspiring entrepreneurs have equitable access to business capital and support regardless of gender, ethnicity or linguistic ability.

The United Nations has stated that increasing women's wealth has a greater impact on the Sustainable Development Goals than any single initiative. We are launching a significant global education program and awareness campaign - the \"3.3.3 Challenge\" - to inspire 3 million women over the next 3 years to invest $3B in women-led businesses and/or with a gender lens in the public markets (average investment of $1000, as per salon survey results below). No other group or fund has had this mission, target or potential. We see activating women around their economic power as the next step in women's empowerment. The #MeToo and #TimesUp movements are important but are reactions to men behaving badly. The 3.3.3 Challenge is proactive and about women embracing and seizing their power. Whether they have 25 cents, $25 or $25M, have a piggy bank or own a bank, we can educate and direct women on how they can invest in women... and change the world!",

There's a return on investment that builds generational wealth. Women-led businesses typically outperform males in EVERY measure of profitability. - The money has impact. When more women entrepreneurs receive funding, adverse personnel issues dramatically improve. - The world gets better. Money is 1.17x more likely to go into social impact businesses while improving economic power of women. What happens when women invest their money with intention? Women gain real ROI. They build sustainable wealth and invest in women entrepreneurs creating a sustainable wealth cycle. - Women entrepreneurs get funding. Currently, women-led businesses receive only 3% of venture capital, 22% of angel funding and 4% of loans. For women of color it's worse. Yet women are starting businesses at 1.5x more than men and their businesses are more successful over time."

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The National Human Trafficking Hotline reported California as the state with the highest amount of received signals and cases of human trafficking. While trustworthy data on the dispersion by city of the statewide trafficking cases is not easily accessible, Elevate Academy data also shows that of the total students served since inception, the largest percentage are California-based, with a significant amount residing in LA County. These combined data points make the previously mentioned issue of income inequality amongst LA-based survivors a substantial concern. Through Elevate Academy's LA Professional Development Survivor Chapter, survivors will grow in their career skills, preparing them to launch into successful employment and sustainable income stability. This will reduce the income inequality across the city, raise the overall standard of living for the average LA citizen, and empower the economy for survivors.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "When human trafficking survivors first get out of their trafficking situation, many have no education, no marketable skills, no job history, a criminal record, and no supportive relationships outside of their trafficker to navigate the economic barriers they face. Many lack certain skills that their peers, those that are not survivors, developed through education, life experiences, and autonomy. Rebecca Bender Initiative (RBI) and its innovative online school for survivors, Elevate Academy, have served over 1400 survivor students on a global scale since 2014, providing them with professional development and economic empowerment resources. While Elevate provides survivors with an effective online program for developing career skills, leadership recently identified a need for in-person community and tangible training resources for survivors in and around Los Angeles. Enter Elevate's Professional Development Chapter for survivors in LA county. This unique, collaborative community will support human trafficking survivors in acquiring and refining the skills necessary to gain career opportunities, connect with professional networks, and, ultimately, step out of economic disadvantage. The LA Chapter monthly meetings aim to provide this safe, diverse, and inclusive space for survivors to network with other professionals, explore the career opportunities available to them, practice interviewing skills, and openly discuss the challenges they are facing in entering the local workforce.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The systemic issue of human trafficking, or the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act, does not discriminate; instead, it can affect a person regardless of age, race, ethnicity, gender, marital status, or income. The data shows, however, that human trafficking specifically targets the marginalized and vulnerable communities within our society in a cyclical pattern. The Polaris Project, the nonprofit that operates the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, reported that nearly 83% of survivors experienced poverty while 96% experienced some form of abuse or other household instability. Our own data proves these shocking statistics of inequality to be true - of the Elevate Academy students who felt comfortable disclosing their income, 75% reported an annual income of $30,000 or less. With trafficking disproportionately affecting lower income populations, support for survivors is a crucial step to overcome income inequality in Los Angeles.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The LA Professional Development Chapter launched in March of 2023. Individual chapter success is measured through achieving the goals for community partnership, chapter enrollment, and volunteer advocacy. The LA Professional Development Chapter's year one goal is to build relationships with 20 local strategic partners with the purpose of aligning survivors with professional opportunities. Chapter enrollment capacity is 40 survivors, and our goal is to reach capacity by the end of the first year of operation. Current attendance averages 20 survivors a meeting with only four meetings hosted so far in 2023. Additionally, for every meeting attended, each survivor receives a certificate of attendance to a professional development training to present to their employers and to use as accumulative training hours required by their agency and on their resumes. 100% of chapter attendees stated that the certification was a successful incentive to attend meetings.",

In 2018, SoLa found that 9 of the 10 largest South LA high schools lacked access to tech related electives and equipment. Furthermore, 47% of South LA households lack reliable broadband internet connectivity making the region the least internet connected region in LA County. It is well understood that technology access for K-12 students directly impacts academic performance, which in turn affects higher education achievement, earning potential, and life-long financial stability. These systemic access gaps in South LA place Black and brown youth at a structural disadvantage to accessing economic opportunity and can be seen in woeful representation of Black and brown workers in the tech industry. The Center aims to help close this gap.",

The center offers youth (ages 8-21) training and skills building opportunities in four career pathways: 1) Technology; 2) Entrepreneurship; 3) Arts, Media and Entertainment; 4) Video Game Design and Production. Classes include coding, video game development, graphic design, robotics, engineering, video and music production, entrepreneurship and more. The center has served more than 3000 students since opening in January 2022. SoLa is growing a robust employment pipeline program by partnering with leading brands Riot Games, Live Nation Entertainment, Cisco, Roland and others to design curriculum, apprenticeships and certificate programs that teach in-demand tech career skills. Expanding these programs is a key strategic priority for the center. The facility includes creative and learning labs, a production and recording studio, esports and video game design arena, content streaming studio and community gathering space. All programs are free and the center's goal is to serve at least 2500 students annually. With the support of LA2050, SoLa can achieve this goal and help fundamentally change the trajectory of young people's lives in South LA.",

Our definition of success is for every student who enters our career pathway programs to emerge with job ready skills to enter the workforce at 18 or help propel their college education. LA's $92B tech industry is woefully unrepresentative of the county's diversity, which helps to widening the racial wealth gap. A more diverse tech workforce supplied with trained professionals from the center will attract capital to historically underinvested areas of South LA.

SCLA launched Will Power to Youth (WPY) in direct response to the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest, when a renewed focus on employment, education, and community-building became an appropriate response to needs expressed by marginalized youth. WPY is intentionally operated during the summer, which is typically a high-risk time-correlating with when youth their age and in their neighborhoods often drop out of high school and/or get caught up in the justice system. Youth are paid as employees, allowing WPY to serve as their summer employment while communicating that they are valued as emerging artists.",

Simultaneously, youth build skills of responsibility, teamwork, communication, and workplace etiquette. Participants are selected by interview, not audition. SCLA's primary selection criteria is a willingness to try something new. Youth are guided throughout by trained teaching artists/mentors, as well as peer mentors who are program alumni. Each WPY participant is engaged in both writing and performing in culminating production, but each participant also chooses an \"artistic team\" as their focus: Acting, Writing, Movement, Scenic Design, Costume Design, or Sound Design. Each artistic team is led by a professional Mentor Artist who teaches their content area and guides students in realizing their visions. After studying the designated play's themes (the play for 2024 is to-be-determined), youth work in groups to pitch production choices, such as time period, location, and suggestions for new characters. Once the production is cast, rehearsals begin with each participant paraphrasing their lines to ensure understanding, even when they ultimately speak Shakespearean English onstage. Each WPY program culminates in free public performances followed by facilitated post-show discussions with audiences full of youth's families, friends, educators, and SCLA regular theatergoers.",

For participants, we disseminate pre- and post-program surveys that measure growth of tangible skills, literacy, appreciation for the arts, and attitudes about people different from the participants themselves. We also send a follow-up questionnaire six months post-program to determine longer-term impacts. From 1993 through 2019, SCLA has employed more than 1,200 youth just through WPY alone, disbursing more than $2.4 million in wages. Third-party evaluation of WPY has previously found that after participation, on average youth typically score 20% higher than their peers on standardized state-wide English language acquisition exams and show notable improvements in their high school attendance and GPAs. While these outcomes correlate with our WPY program, they are also a testament to the youth we serve.",

Classes are presented in English and Spanish by CSUN students and environmental leaders (parents and grandparents) from our community partner, Parent Pioneers. Class starts with a teatro or presentation of a culturally relevant children's story. Families discuss their connections to and understanding of the meaning of the story. A role model of a person of color scientist is presented to encourage the children to consider these careers. This discussion then leads to the question of the day (QoD). For example, \"How do we make a simple motor?\" Presenters employ movement, models, songs, and games to teach the concepts related to the QoD. For example, the movement of electrons within a system. Families then use hands-on materials to figure out how to make a simple electric motor. The class wraps up by returning to the QoD to gauge participants' understanding of the concepts. We also take families on outings to public lands and/or science centers to deepen their connections to nature. This unique multi-generational project taps into the funds of knowledge and strengths held within families.

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "To date, RCDC has: -Provided 11,000 meals -Distributed 5,000 articles of clothes -Provided 3,000 showers -Delivered 2,000 vital records -Housed 1,200 unsheltered people -Connected 800 people to mental health services While these numbers tell the scale of our success, the personal impacts go well beyond statistics. Grant and Tracey are two guests who attended RCDC events regularly prior to the pandemic. They had this to say: \"My wife and I have been homeless for 1.5 years...We come to get a shower, food and clothing. Thank you very much... we signed up for this new shelter that was in the process of opening from HOPICS. The Lord above and RCDC got us in. This place is GREAT! Now, we have a place to lay our heads... Thank you to everyone involved.\" After writing this, Grant and Tracey continued to be regular participants in RCDC programs and they now live in permanent housing. Their multi-year journey speaks to the importance of RCDC's commitment and consistency in building community.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "South LA",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "We begin addressing homelessness by restoring dignity to the people experiencing it. To do this, RCDC holds events at black churches in South LA; these events assemble essential services where our target population lives, and in spaces where they feel fellowship and respect. Our events feel like a church picnic or neighborhood cookout and that's intentional. To get in the mental space to seek help, we understand that people need their basic needs met first. That's why we always provide hot showers, delicious meals, and new clothes on site. We want to meet people's short-term needs, so they have the self esteem to seek longer-term aid. We know that every journey into and out of homelessness is unique and requires different interventions. That's why we partner with dozens of nonprofits and government services who attend our events. HOPICS and LAHSA help attendees get housed. We address health barriers by offering addiction treatment through SCHARP, mental health support through LACDMH, and vaccinations and physical healthcare through Benevolence Health Centers. Legal barriers to housing are tackled by Public Counsel and the Criminal Record Clearing Project. Family reunification services and creative writing workshops rebuild social support networks. And this is just a sample of our partners. By organizing these services into a single space, we help attendees regain their agency and decision-making. We make sure that no need is left uncovered so that every need is met.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We know that the solution to homelessness is community. Homelessness affects everyone - whether we are a person experiencing it or a person witnessing it - and therefore the solution requires everyone as well. RCDC's programs bring in members from all walks of life to solve the County's most pressing crisis. We envision a Los Angeles where everyone is entitled to respect and decency. We envision a Los Angeles where we work together to address a person's needs as opposed to finding a way to pass the buck to another agency or program. We envision a Los Angeles where there are not \"resource fairs\" but community events put on by the very people who live and work in those communities. We envision a Los Angeles where our program can continue to support people in South LA achieve their dreams and goals, but where we no longer have to provide their most basic needs.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Although RCDC partners with dozens of nonprofits and government organizations who attend our events and serve our guests experiencing homelessness, for the purposes of this grant, RCDC will be solely responsible for expanding programming, recruiting providers to said events and performing all other initiatives funded by this grant."

    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "LA's Department of Children and Family Services has the 2nd largest population of foster youth in the US with more than 30,000 on any given day-most in need of caring adult mentors as part of their support structure. Consider this: the CA. Governor reported that the high school graduation rate of foster youth was only 61% and the Bureau of Justice reported that a fifth of the US prison population is comprised of former foster youth. LATM seeks to address these issues by providing them with a structured, reliable support system and by helping them develop their social and emotional skills. LATM's programs include elements of school readiness and career exploration with the intention of helping them graduate in a college-ready capacity. There is a strong correlation between education-level and potential for income. By preparing them in their formative years, they will have the tools to be self-sufficient in adulthood and to have the opportunity for upward economic mobility.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LATM was created to build a bridge of hope and future success for children in LA's most under-resourced communities. Here's how LA County would be different if just ONE element of our work is successful. A new partnership with regional offices of DCFS would allow foster youth direct access to LATM's caring mentors and services. Because ERC's program evaluation revealed that LATM mentees graduated at a 22% higher rate than their peers, it's conceivable that foster youth with access to e-Works increase their likelihood of graduating to 83%! This is astounding, as: 1) this levels the playing field since the graduation rate for non-foster youth is similar at 87%, and 2) since LATM does not provide tutoring, this underscores the value of developing a child's social-emotional skills. By 2050, LA's youth will have access to a caring mentor, greater opportunities for economic mobility, and will continue to impart their knowledge on the next generation. \"We rise by lifting others.\"",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Youth Economic Advancement (sponsored by the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation)",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "This grant will support LATM's e-Works virtual youth mentoring program, benefitting 800 at-risk mentees (ages 11-14) in Los Angeles County. In e-Works, youth are connected with a team of 3 volunteer mentors, 10 - 12 peers, and 1 experienced staff member. Mentoring sessions operate 6 days a week from October to June; participants attend 30 weekly sessions per year. The program follows an activity-rich, progressive learning curriculum focused on social-emotional development. In addition to weekly mentoring, youth attend skills-based field trips led by our corporate partners on select Saturdays. Partners include Aerospace Corporation, ARUP, Bank of America, EY, Cisco, JPMorgan Chase, UCLA, Loyola Marymount University, Woodbury University, and Mount Saint Mary's University. These events allow our mentees to discover opportunities that lie beyond their neighborhood and strengthen the bond between peers and mentors: (a) e-Works University - a college awareness field trip to a local university; students tour the campus, learn about the admissions process/financial aid, and discuss the benefits of higher education. (b) Career Exploration - a career readiness field trip to a local corporation; students learn about the various career paths available within that industry and how they might pursue it. (c) End of Year Celebration - a fun team building field trip where students acknowledge and celebrate their accomplishments.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "LATM has partnered with a third-party data firm (ERC) to track success. They found that, in comparison to their peers, LATM mentees: (a) achieved a mean grade point average that was .41 points higher; (b) scored 34 points higher in math and 26 points higher in English on the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP); (c) had school attendance that was 2% better than the district average; and (d) sustained a higher rate of on-time grade promotion from 8th to 12th grade. In fact, the LATM mentees' rate of on-time grade promotion was 4% higher than the district average in their freshman year...that gap had widened to 14% by their senior year! Another study found that LATM mentees were graduating high school at a 22% higher rate than their peers. There was no significant statistical variation in the data with regard to race/ethnicity, gender, or service area, indicating that youth were benefitting in an equitable and consistent manner."

The population we serve - of whom 96% are BIPOC - need culturally responsive arts education and the opportunity to explore creative industry careers. While only 27% of Los Angeles' population is White, most employees in the creative industries are White. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is focused on improving career pathways in the creative sector - especially for BIPOC youth and those who have been involved with the justice system. Los Angeles' creative sector has tremendous economic impact; it is responsible for 699,600 jobs and $53.5 billion in labor income, or 18.5% of the County's workforce.

Our community-based programs promote healing and teach resiliency by allowing participants to make personal connections to their culture, identity, and community. While healing will always be at the core of everything we do, we also recognize the need to develop the technical skills and talents of our youth to prepare them for employment in creative industries. The Homeboy Art Academy offers a multimedia lab where youth can learn in-demand tech-focused design careers in the creative industry (i.e., learning graphic design to create logos and other promotional materials). The lab also provides virtual reality (VR) headsets which youth can use to learn basic coding to create their own virtual spheres. Homeboy Art Academy also features a Music Production Program in which youth receive instruction and practice time to learn elements within the production, engineering, writing, and recording of music, spoken word, and podcasts. Youth have also participated in stand-up comedy lessons designed to help them process their trauma through humor. All youth then create high-quality digital portfolios - which includes musical tracks and accompanying artwork, recordings of podcasts, and videos from stand-up comedy performances - to showcase their work and increase their professionalism when applying for jobs in the creative industries.",

Our Prosperity Bucks program is free money that we give residents to shop which strengthens the purchasing power of healthy foods in underserved communities. We also have digital bucks which can be used to shop online. We're piloting digital bucks with a housing complex for formerly unhoused seniors in South LA.

Program materials are designed to be highly accessible for people with little or no business education, with all services and materials provided in Spanish and English but open to everyone. ICON CDC aids vendors in obtaining permits and licenses to run their enterprises legally and safely as well as support for expanding their businesses (such as by purchasing food carts or opening storefront locations). Based on ICON CDC's 22 years of experience serving local businesses, this mix of services is highly effective at meeting the needs of underserved entrepreneurs. ICON CDC's services allow vendors and their families to prosper economically, reducing income inequality in the region.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The outcomes for youth transitioning out of foster care are dismal. They often lack essential skills and support infrastructure that are necessary to transition into adulthood. We aim to address this by offering critical skills workshops in an engaging cohort model. We partner with organizations that provide mentorship support to TAY and system impacted youth and enroll them in our workshop program. By teaching skills within an existing and high quality support model throughout the course of a year, we provide these young people with the basic tools they need to help transition into adulthood. We also help ensure that they have the clothing and essential items that are required for them to successfully participate in a work or school environment. Our workshop outreach partners ensure that the young people we work with are in a structure that will continue to nurture and support their growth.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "For this coming year we are hoping to support at least 100 young people in this program. Our vision is that this is a program that can scale over time, to work on multiple tracks to keep the groups small but serve more youth. Working with high quality facilitators to create best practices and hone the offerings to be the most effective. There is no reason across the county why this model cannot be offered ultimately to all young people as they transition out of foster care. As youth transition out of foster care the lack of family, community and governmental support leave these young people in very precarious positions. Many system impacted people in our prison system and who are currently unhoused, were former foster youth. If we can intervene to provide them with some support infrastructure as they move into adulthood, then we can have a huge impact on homelessness, early pregnancy and incarceration.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our workshop program is based on a belief that all young people should be given the basic tools to successfully navigate the transition to adulthood. However, these tools cannot be delivered in a vacuum. They must be delivered by trusted relatable facilitators, in a format that is engaging, relevant, and supportive to build a solid foundation of skills. We provide unique and innovative programming around financial independence, nutritional support, and social/emotional wellness. Each of these pillars is delivered in a manner that is relevant and engaging. For example, rather than offering a dry text book lesson on budgeting and financial planning we work with local entrepreneurs who bring their personal stories to these often challenging topics. Critically, the young people move through the workshops together so they can lean on each, share input and create community. Finally, TAY youth often do not have resources to purchase necessary clothing, technology and other essential items to start their new jobs. Our storefront is fully stocked with brand new clothing and essential items, and we have a dedicated fund to purchase laptops. We offer high quality new items that break socio economic barriers so our young people to start their college journey and jobs feeling comfortable and confident. This impact is both immediate and ongoing. Because our young people come from vetted wrap around service organizations, we know they will always have someone looking out for them.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This is an existing program that we launched this past January and is currently offered to approximately 200 youth through three modules. All of the youth who are part of our cohort program participate in an existing mentorship programs for TAY youth. This part of our model is critical as it allows us to track outcomes over time and to have ongoing engagement with the young people we serve. We collect simple surveys to measure understanding and engagement immediately after each workshop but plan to develop a more robust survey to capture detailed metrics . We recently subscribe to a data collection platform that will collect, measure and aggregate our data with uniformity. Additionally, we are working with our partners to assess how youth outcomes related to finances and job stability are impacted by participation in this program."

We will build solidarity between workers across ethnic lines. We successfully organized Thai and Latinx immigrant workers during the Retailer Accountability Campaign to end sweatshops in the garment industry, before the Thai Garment Slavery Case was discovered and created a powerful immigrant workers' rights movement that led to Sweatshop Watch, Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, and adoption of legislation to reform the garment industry.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "After 29 years of dedicated effort, we have found that strategies for economic development in the Thai community of Los Angeles has been undermined by the limitations imposed by the basic economic structure of the community. As long as Thai immigrants are employed primarily as unskilled workers in a service economy, they are subject to wage theft and exploitation which prevents them from taking advantage of every type of opportunity that Thai CDC has sought to provide them to exit the service economy and become self-sufficient. A Thai workers' center could be the catalyst for expanded economic opportunity for the Thai community that would greatly increase the success and impact of all our other community development work while advancing the struggle for immigrant and human rights. It could affirm the reality that innovative and radical approaches to alleviating poverty cannot substitute the impact of an empowered citizenry organized to demand equality and economic justice.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The project aims to create a Thai Worker Center (TWC) that will provide the vast majority of Thai immigrant laborers who work in the service economy with a platform that could help them turn a system of exploitation into an engine for economic self-sufficiency and participation. We envision this platform as an immigrant workers' center where Thai workers can learn about labor rights, find solidarity in each other, and organize, mobilize, and lead a movement to fight wage theft and demand justice from their employers. In the first year, we would hire a worker leader to recruit, educate, and empower at least 50 Thai speaking workers to participate in our program. The Center will start an English language acquisition program specifically geared towards Thai workers who are not available for traditional ESL classes. We will partner with local ESL programs to provide instruction and materials to at least 15 workers per semester. In addition, the TWC would provide navigational support for vocational skills building and job placement. It will partner with organizations like the Hospitality Training Academy and other vocational schools with apprenticeship opportunities to increase vocational skills and job placement. It will refer at least 50 workers to programs with job placement assistance."

After being welcomed into one of ANWOL's homes, the first 30 days is a time for each woman to begin to acclimate to a world that has changed during the time she has been incarcerated. Her day starts at 8:00 am for morning mediation; a time to gather and begin the day with affirmations and a positive mindset. This 30-day period is also a time for her to learn to use a mobile phone, enjoy home cooked meals by staff in the evening and begin to start her healing journey. With staff assistance, she starts working on accessing personal ID and documents that will be needed for school and/or employment. Our housing coordinator that specializes in medical care navigation begins to help women access needed medication and physical/mental health care services. Our housing staff works closely with each woman to support her in developing short-term and long-term goals. Resources are brought to each woman as individually needed. Does she want to go to school? Does she need additional support in her recovery from substance misuse? Is she seeking a job? What does she hope for in a career? Does she need to regain custody of her children? All support services are tailored to individual need. There is no specified time limit that a woman must graduate to permanent housing and independence.

A 2018 Prison Policy Initiative Report, \"Nowhere to Go\", shows people who have been to prison are 10X more likely to be homeless than the general population. The report documents that people recently released from prison are at most risk of being homeless, with rates nearly 12 times higher than the public, and women - Black women in particular - are especially at risk. Most ANWOL residents have histories of homelessness -- many are released with only $200 in gate money, some in the middle of the night. Without safe places to reside, these women are at risk of being victimized, as well as re-incarcerated. Our homes provide a place for formerly incarcerated women to heal and excel."

The Training Program is also a resource for recent immigrants with the majority of graduates able to earn 50-100% more after program completion. Promotores gain employment from various hospitals, CBO's, government offices, and educational institutions, and they do not have to be deployed to \"hard to reach\" areas because they already live, work, and are engaged in those areas. They have a unique ability to reach vulnerable, low-income, and underserved members of the Latinx and Black communities.

Opening in October, the Center builds upon Didi Hirsch's existing TAY programming, with an array of services targeting this population's specific needs. Here, TAY will be inspired to embark on positive journeys into adulthood by addressing mental health and substance use issues, accessing educational and vocational support, creating healthy relationships, meeting basic needs, and attaining greater independence. The TAY Wellness Center is located at our Glendale site, in a region where gaps for TAY services are prevalent. The dedicated space already has a kitchen, shower and separate entrance. In July, renovations will commence to improve the existing facility and add dedicated space for laundry, educational and artistic pursuits, and leisure activities. We expect that many clients will be transitioning from foster care, with about 1 in 3 experiencing homelessness. Most will have a serious mental illness, often with co-occurring substance use issues. Our TAY Wellness Center is unique due to its: -One-stop-shop design. -TAY Advisory Council providing feedback from the client perspective. -Seamless connection to our nationally renowned Suicide Prevention Center. -Adult services located upstairs for ongoing care after age 25. -Onsite recording studio for creating content by teens, for teens. -Mobile outreach to build trust and encourage service utilization.",

That said, there is limited evidence-based research on TAY service effectiveness in LA County, as we learned while interviewing other agencies during the planning phase. Data collection is focused on short-term utilization metrics mandated by government contracts, providing no way to gauge long-term outcomes. This project is a chance to enhance this research base. Our robust Research and Evaluation (R&E) team will oversee data collection and reporting. Our electronic health record will provide service utilization and demographic information. We will also record outcome measures like housing and employment/education status, physical health, substance use and mental health symptoms at intake, every six months and at discharge. Our R&E capacity will also allow us to track long-term outcomes like hospitalization, incarceration and homelessness rates.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "LA County is in the midst of an unprecedented mental health crisis. Clinical depression rates are at all-time highs, with teens and young adults experiencing the most dramatic increases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, suicide has risen sharply amongst people ages 10-24, particularly those identifying as Black, Latinx or female, and ranks as the third leading cause of death for TAY ages 16-25. Especially vulnerable are the approximate 1,400 TAY who transition out of the County's foster care system every year. The scars of trauma-poverty, abuse, neglect and other adverse childhood experiences-drive many young adults to live on the streets, drop out of school or vocational programs, or enter the criminal justice system. They often lack access to physical and mental health care, despite their tremendous need, and are resistant to accessing these services when they are available due to barriers like transportation and an inherent distrust of the system that let them down.",

Our short- and longer-term goals are to: -Complete renovations and open the Center in October 2023. -Serve 150 TAY clients in year one, eventually increasing to 300 annually once the Center is fully operational. -Improve access to medical and mental health care, inclusive of substance use counseling. -Help TAY meet their basic needs, learn life skills to help them transition into adulthood, achieve their educational and vocational goals, obtain safe and affordable housing, find outlets for artistic expression to heal their traumas, build self-efficacy, and develop positive and stable lifelong relationships."

Recent studies by the Brookings Institute and the CDD have identified connectiveness to the community and school is a predictor for a successful future for children and youth. They reported that a sense of being cared for, supported, and belonging at school, called \"school connectedness\" has an important effect on students especially during a time of severe disruption periods like the pandemic. Youth who felt connected to adults and peers at school were less likely to report persistent feelings of sadness or suicidal thoughts and actual attempts at suicide. For youth of color, experiences of racism have been linked to poor mental health, academic performance, and lifelong health risky behaviors.

Far too often individuals with disabilities are spoken for, prohibiting them from having ownership over their own narratives and thereby perpetuating inaccurate stereotypes. They are regularly excluded from music and performance-based programs because funders and social service agencies fail to recognize the efficacy of the expressive/performing arts in enhancing communication among non-speaking individuals. Politically, they are one of the audiences least engaged with by elected officials. Our participants and their families simply want a seat at the table, and they are consistently, and sometimes systematically, refused a chair - or a vote.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "TMP has been a source of community for individuals of all abilities for almost 20 years. We fight the stigma that haunts autistic and disabled individuals by embracing those with disabilities for who they are and applying innovative arts curricula to creatively join their world instead of trying to force them to join ours. TMP is also firmly committed to the expression championed during the Disability Rights Movement - \"Nothing About Us Without Us.\" As such, all of TMP's original content is participant-driven. The concept of \"Our Voice is Our Vote\" came directly from a participant in the Express Yourself class, and TMP staff then held a brainstorming session with participants to gauge their interest in the project and hold space for them to develop the idea. Additionally, Hollywood is trying to have authentic representation of people of all abilities and does not have a talent pool to draw from. TMP is developing this talent pool through our I Can Do That Program, a unique ground-breaking, evidence-based methodology, which is becoming a sought after resource for Hollywood and is transforming the entertainment industry and the way the world sees and understands neurodiversity. To date, TMP has helped more than 30 individuals secure employment in film and television, including on hit shows for Netflix, NBC, ABC, Fox and Amazon. Finally, the Miracle Masters Internship Program allows individuals trained in our methodology to parlay their experience into a career in the arts.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "TMP envisions a world where the voices and stories of the neurodivergent are heard and honored, and where they have self representation in both the arts and in the political arena. To help make this a reality, TMP shares our methodology and the talents of our participants, and continues to be a sustainable presence in the local community through social skills classes, musical theater classes, acting for film/TV and film production classes, public appearances and performances, professional trainings, parent and caregiver support groups, and the writing, lectures and speeches of our program leaders. Last year, local venues where TMP students performed included: the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts; Skirball Cultural Center; Dodgers Stadium; UCLA; and the Afro-Classical Composers Concert. TMP currently offers classes both online and at The Wallis, and we envision future expansion of our in person classes into the San Fernando Valley and the South Bay in the near future."

(2003); Askeland, I.R. & Heir, T. (2014); Hosie J., Gilbert F., Simpson K., & Daffern M. (2014)]. Stress and trauma experienced in childhood and adolescence contributes to risk factors associated with higher levels of violence and poor educational outcomes including low grades, suspensions and dropping out of school. Stress can cause, and often exacerbates impulsivity, anxiety, depression, anger, bullying, lack of motivation, low self- esteem, low self-control, ADHD, inability to think critically, and proclivity for substance abuse. Toxic stress activates the fight-or- flight response, causing the prefrontal cortex, responsible for judgment, decision-making, and impulse control, to be deactivated. Under conditions of chronic stress, the prefrontal cortex becomes smaller and less effective, which may contribute to anti-social or violent behavior.",

Published research establishes the impact of TM on reducing anxiety, depression, anger, low self-control, ADHD, substance abuse and criminal recidivism. The TM technique is a simple and easy to practice meditation. It involves no focused attention or open monitoring, making it unique in its ability to reduce Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. (Weill Cornell Medical Center - New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City - where a pilot study of physicians found significant reductions in physician burnout, insomnia, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress over a three-month period practicing TM). There have been over 400 peer-reviewed, published studies conducted on TM verifying the physiological and psychological benefits of the practice for reducing stress and stress-related disorders, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, insomnia and heart disease. (https://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/research.html#education) Youth and their families will be referred to our LA team by social workers and clinicians from LAUSD's Student Health and Human Services (SHHS) department and given the opportunity to learn TM.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our work with communities is to support them achieving systemic change by providing the tool of TM for expanding potential and reducing mental and physical symptoms related to trauma and toxic stress, and therefore, decrease the tendency for violence. In a study, where the impact of TM on 9th grade students was examined, outcomes between students participating in the program and not participating were compared. Those who learned TM demonstrated lower anxiety and higher resilience compared to the students who did not participate. (Wendt, S.; Hipps, J.; Abrams, A; et al. Contemp School Psychol. 2015.) ?An IRB has been approved by UCLA for a one-year research study on TM and improved family life. ?Parents and caregivers will be invited to participate in the study. ?

By partnering with LAUSD and working with many families in under-resourced communities we increase our ability to have real positive impact. HF/HC has shown to improve the overall mental and physical health, focus, academic achievement and parental engagement among families (youth and parents/guardians) who choose to participate. The program is designed to ensure families engage in a shared positive experience and increased connection within the family. With this increase in a strong, positive healthy foundation at home, we expect neighborhoods to benefit with a safer environment and all-around increased peace and wellness for our communities in Los Angeles County.",

This grant would support our professional training in Los Angeles including: A new Professional Learning Community (PLC) in the region, with weekly check-ins for teachers to learn about the curriculum pacing and additional resources, share ideas on face-to-face, group, and virtual teaching, and support each other in this new role. Professional development workshop in cultural competency and inclusion for teachers to embed diversity, equity, and inclusion practices to boost career self-efficacy in low-income and other underserved students. A K-12 Labor Market Summit coordinated with regional colleges and employers, sharing how students can access high-wage, high-demand careers with options for low-cost training to enter those jobs.

Over the last two years, Children Now has been deeply involved in elevating youth voices in LA's implementation efforts to ensure this large-scale system meets the needs of children and youth with foster care experience, and we have been successful in ensuring needed improvements are made based on youth and caregiver feedback. At recent Children Now-facilitated implementation meetings and focus groups attended by close to 20 LA youth, youth have overwhelmingly voiced that FURS is wanted, needed, and appreciated, but supports provided by peers with lived experience in foster care must be intentionally incorporated to build youth trust and engagement in FURS. We will take this feedback directly to the public agencies responsible for FURS--the LA County Departments of Children and Family Services (DCFS), Mental Health (DMH), and Probation-and join with other community stakeholders to emphasize the need for peer supports as a priority area for improvement. Children Now will leverage its position as an advocate and partner in this space to elevate the direct asks of children and youth in foster care.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "By deepening trust and thereby engagement in FURS, LA County will see improved outcomes across the board for the 18,000+ children and youth who have spent time in foster care. Research shows that many youth struggle emotionally, physically, and academically while in care and can continue to struggle with housing and employment into adulthood. On top of that, children and youth of color are disproportionately negatively impacted by the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. Our efforts to improve FURS are part of Children Now's mission to dismantle the systemic barriers that exist in child welfare, mental health, law enforcement, and juvenile justice that disproportionately affect children and youth of color. By ensuring safe, supportive connections to peers, FURS can help LA County children and youth in care achieve greater stability, more nurturing placements, and targeted health care that will help them thrive at home, in school, at work, and beyond.",

However, calls from LA youth to FURS have been slow to come in. For many youth, their distrust of foster care can prevent them from feeling comfortable engaging with the resources available to support their wellbeing, such as FURS. To grow their trust and engagement in FURS, youth are calling for more peers with lived experience in foster care to be part of the FURS team. Support from peers can help children and youth feel heard and understood and give them a trusted ally during critical moments, encouraging them to make use of this vital resource. Increasing the use of FURS can contribute directly to improved health, education, housing, and employment outcomes for children and youth in the long run."

Our program would work to rebuild confidence into these students and their families. We created a safe place for them to learn and grow where the role of the teaching staff is then able to change from instructor, to a mentor and a person who truly knows and cares about the individual they are teaching, creating specific opportunities to enrich their lives how they see fit for each person.

Although millions of people are registered to become organ donors only 2% of those organs are viable for transplantation. So the import of being a donor whose organs are used is huge. Organ donor families find so much peace knowing that their loved one is passing on the gift of life to someone else, that they are at least leaving a legacy behind. One never knows what the person receiving the gift of life will accomplish with that gift. Without the donor, there is no lifesaving transplant. Organ Procurement Agencies provide much emotional support to donor families but it is unlawful for them to assist these families financially. Families who have lost someone whose death saves lives deserve thanks, and if needed, financial help for a dignified burial. Almost 75% of those we help are Hispanic, and all are low-income families living in LA.",

We speak with them and have them fill out our application. We then send the burial or cremation center a check to cover all or part of it, depending on our funds at that time. Transplantation is a fast and growing field. Seven years ago only 25,000 transplants were performed in the US. Last year over 41,000 were performed. 35% of these were performed here in LA. In the past we were able to pay for the entire cost of a burial, but we now get so many requests that we can only pay $200 towards each, which is about one-quarter of the cost."

They will then have the opportunity to apply their skills to robotics activities and acquire their own personal Q-Scout Robot. Once the student achieves satisfactory progress, they will advance to the next level of the Coding Lab. The ultimate goal is that they will develop the skills needed to program their Robot by the end of the school year and beginning of Summer Session. After successfully programming their robot, they will have opportunities to showcase their completed projects.",

The most recent Point-in-Time count completed in 2022 revealed that our service area of SPA 3 was home to some 5,173 homeless individuals. The long-term economic impacts of inflation, increased costs of living, low-paying jobs, and high rental rates are leaving many low-income families extremely vulnerable for homelessness. Many are living paycheck to paycheck and a job loss or health emergency can quickly derail their finances, and as a result their housing. We receive an average of 100 calls a week requesting shelter; requests for one-time rental assistance have more than doubled and show no signs of slowing. Our proposed program expansion would help bring 7 additional beds to the shelter to help families and single women move from homelessness to permanent housing, and prevent dozens of families from falling into homelessness.",

With intensive program support from us and our collaborative partners, families and single women are prepared to enter and sustain permanent housing when they leave our program. Our Rental Assistance program will allow more LA County households at high-risk of losing their housing due to temporary challenges to avoid homelessness and stay in their homes, while case management and referrals assist them to sustain their housing beyond program exit.

Most clients exit into stable housing. 2) Rental assistance is homeless prevention providing 1-3 months rental assistance to families or persons experiencing an emergency, with rent in arrears or due within ten days. Clients are asked to show income that will normally cover their needs, so they won't become homeless the month following service. After program exit, we check back with both client and landlord to see if further case management or supportive service referrals are needed to maintain client in their home. Clients in both programs are assisted in making individual action plans to realize their goals for achieving or maintaining permanent housing, self-reliance and independence. Through involvement with community collaborations, and by coordinating with other social service agencies, both public and private, the program is designed to fill gaps in the existing system of homeless support/prevention services. We are expanding the program to reach more homeless/near homeless LA county residents through added shelter beds and rental assistance for more clients.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Success for the shelter program is being able to provide room, board and all supportive services to our clients, and successfully move families to safe and stable housing. Outcomes for clients (with recent results) include: 1) move into safe, stable and sustainable housing for at least 4 months after moving out of the shelter (85+%); 2) successfully completing at least 75% of personal goals while in the shelter (87%); 3) saving at least $1,000 while in the shelter (51%). These goals are evaluated through review of case management documents, exit interviews and surveys taken at 1 and 4 months after families exit the program. We provided over 6,000 bed nights of housing over the last two years. Success for rental assistance is: 100% of those assisted will remain housed for another 30 days, and an additional 85%+ of these families will retain their housing for at least 6 months following assistance.

If the individual is experiencing behavioral health and/mental health concerns, it often limits their ability to fully comprehend the necessities required for sustaining basic needs, stability, increase independence and dignity in life. As a result, we need experts in behavioral health/mental health to support older adults in modulating these behavioral or mental health concerns for progressive strides in their care plan. Due to the lack of immediacy to these experts, professionals are led to connecting with and dependency on Systemwide Mental Health Assessment Response Treatment, Psychiatric Emergency Teams and Psychiatric Mobile Response Team, who are readily unavailable.

The sudden shift to telehealth underscored the necessity of providing the most vulnerable residents with the means to attend to routine, chronic, and/or acute healthcare needs in ways that allow for social distancing. Other vital services also moved online as telephones and tablets replaced in-person meetings. GOAL-Tech is designed to allow older adults to maintain and strengthen their connections with various service providers and their social circles. By providing education, hardware, support, and connectivity to allow older adults to navigate the internet safely and comfortably, SBSS is preparing older adults to better navigate future emergencies.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Approximately 25% of adults over the age of 65 in the US do not use the internet. When everything shut down in March 2020, it soon became obvious that an internet connection was vital for older adults to stay in touch with doctors, family, friends, and other necessary services. As COVID continued to prevent in-person contact into 2021, SBSS began developing the GOAL-Tech program to address the issues that kept older adults from connecting to resources, such as telehealth, online. SBSS launched a pilot program in conjunction with the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology to better tailor the program to the needs of SBSS clients. Research has shown that many older adults experience what is referred to as a second level digital divide related to their comfort levels and skills. Participants in the pilot program stressed the need for patient instructors, hands-on education, cheat sheets, and repetition as keys to gaining confidence and comfort in the use of technology.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The GOAL-Tech program is a six-week class that can be delivered in person or online in small classes. The program does not assume a prior knowledge of technology and covers the basics, including applications, common icons, using cameras and microphones, using email and other messaging programs, online safety, and telehealth basics. A full class period is devoted to review and Q&A, with ample time for questions during each class period. Recordings are made of all online classes so that participants can review concepts and information as necessary. Handouts, workbooks, and manuals are provided for all participants to reinforce the concepts taught in class. The program is designed specifically for English and Spanish speaking older adults but is also offered to their informal caregivers. Caregivers are included so that they may aid the people for whom they care and so that they can develop the skills for themselves. Informal caregivers are often family members and may not have access to the resources to allow for education in technology. In addition, all participants who complete the program have access to a lending library of tablets and hotspots so that they may use the devices in their own homes. SBSS is planning to expand the program to include more languages and a wider geographic area. SBSS provides the city-wide Family Caregiver Support Program through the Los Angeles Department of Aging and is looking to target caregivers throughout the city.",

English and Spanish-speaking focus group participants reported that they primarily used digital devices to connect with family and friends and cited this ability to connect as a key driver of continued use. Family members, prior work experience, and community resources were the main facilitators of regular use, while lack of know-how was the biggest barrier. SBSS expects to scale the program to include more of Los Angeles' vulnerable, low-income older adult population as well as adding additional languages, including Korean. The program includes 6 weeks of in-person or online instruction with handouts, time for questions, and repetition to ensure participant learning.

For this reason, U.S.VETS has partnered with Thomas Safran & Associates and Century Housing to develop the nation's largest veteran housing community at the WLAVA Campus. Construction is well underway and upon completion, there will be an additional 1,200 units of new, affordable housing for veterans and infrastructure that will support more than 3,000 veterans and family members on-site and in the community.

This unique application of the already successful Housing for Health model will translate into a more well-connected wraparound care model. Here, veterans will have access to care coordination, health treatment, behavioral health services, nurse services, and other health services - layered on to existing U.S.VETS services.

In addition, the number of news articles appearing in the local newspapers and each advocacy rally's impact on influencing a board of supervisor action. We will evaluate the focus group surveys and synthesize qualitative responses to present the most robust narrative to prepare to influence the policy and practice changes that aim to reverse the overrepresentation of Black students in the mental health system."

In fact, these resources have lessened exponentially. It is clear this is not a priority, and ironically the laws also attack anyone wanting to provide a supplementary solution. So, we would like to fill this gap, and help make transit in LA a respectful, viable option for those who need it."

The 2023 Bankrate Annual Emergency Savings Report, shows that nearly half (49%) of U.S. adults have less savings (39%) or no savings (10%) compared to a year ago. The survey also reveals that 36% of individuals have more credit card debt than emergency savings, the highest on record since 2011; and 68% of people are worried they wouldn't be able to cover their living expenses for just one month if they lost their primary source of income, including 85% of Gen Zers - the most concerned of any generation.

The curriculum covers: Income; Saving; Investing and Risk Management; Debit & Credit; and Budget. After completing these modules, students visit JA Finance Park, where they put their skills to the test in an innovative, immersive learning environment. Students focus on critical thinking about the connections between education, career, income, savings and long-term financial goals and financial health. This knowledge serves as a foundation in finance education and provides skills students need. Without programs like JA Finance Park, students from low-income communities have few models for realistic steps they can take to improve their own future financial prospects, and little access to inspirational examples of real individuals that motivate them to believe they can take control of their financial futures. JA empowers students with the life-changing skills to manage finances, establish savings and live within a budget, and help students identify solid career pathways that will support them.

In addition, clients learn how to build their credit, landlord-tenant expectations, use housing apps, and sign a lease contract. This program helps clients in various ways to ensure a successful transition or stay in permanent housing. The program provides survivors of DV experiencing a housing crisis with a short-term financial bridge that leads to long-term solutions such as permanent housing and supports them in their accommodation to achieve stability and improve their quality of life. The assistance available for support includes move-in help, rental or relocation assistance, utility assistance, and household start-up assistance. Our Permanent Housing Assistance staff continuously builds relationships with landlords and stakeholders to increase the availability of affordable housing units for our clients, negotiate with landlords, provide case management to promote housing retention, provide financial assistance, and link families with supportive services.

We equip them with good financial planning skills and a short-term financial bridge that leads to long-term solutions such as permanent housing and support them in their accommodation to achieve stability and improve their quality of life. All these services are critical to the clients and their family to achieve self-sufficiency and stay safe. In addition, many of our local landlords had bias and/or prejudices against victims of domestic violence. The main stigma is that the client would bring destruction and chaos to their property because they would have issues with their abuser. We do a lot of education and advocacy on this front by giving the landlords statistics, success stories, and overall relationship building.

Also, lack of employment and employable skills exacerbates the cycle of domestic violence by limiting viable options for self-sufficiency. Yet these women must raise their children on their own after leaving their batterers and they must maintain stable housing in Los Angeles, a city where the median home price is over $700,000 and rents are more than 40% higher than the national average. All these factors precipitate falling into homelessness. Jenesse believes the root or underlying cause of the homelessness epidemic is the lack of economic equity manifested in the unequal distribution of income and economic opportunities. The Covid-19 epidemic has exasperated the persistent racial and social inequities and escalated the financial disparities and instability for people of color living in the least affordable housing market in the U.S.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We mentor clients, help develop their skills, and also monitor the change in their income to ensure they are taking the proper steps to become financially independent. If a client doesn't hit certain increases in their income and savings at certain benchmarks, we ensure that they receive more support. We also do in person visits to ensure they are able to keep their home clean and safe and they have the means to give their children the appropriate nutrition. We also mentor them in how to be good neighbors and tenants. Clients that are struggling in certain areas are then referred to proper resources of support. We stay in touch with the clients for a minimum of twelve months. The retention rate is around 95% right now. We go through several audits every year. Internal and external audits give us insight as to the thoroughness of our record keeping as well as its accuracy.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Public spaces are an important asset to our cities. They provide people many opportunities to come together and engage with the community. If public spaces are successful they are inclusive of the diversity of groups present in our cities and create a social space for everyone in the society to participate in. Many scholars in human geography have explored this idea of 'sociality' in the public sphere. It is basically the interactions people have in the public space and about the connection this forms between the person and the space. This might include the social networks people form on the street or city squares. Creating an opportunity for people to meet new people in the public space is important because this adds to the sociability of public space. Having social events in the public space such as music concerts or hosting movies are also a great way to get people to engage with one another. This creates an intricate connection between the space and the people in it forming a sense of 'togetherness' in the space. The WVIA is seeking grant funding support for enhancements and activations of the Broxton Plaza at Westwood Village, located on Broxton Avenue between Weyburn Avenue and Kinross Avenue.

Unfortunately, many come from homes where gang affiliations run deep and have been for generations, or single-parent homes, where they are raising themselves. Often, this manifests itself in failing grades and, ultimately, failing out of school before graduating high school. Per the latest census, East LA has a 55% high school graduation rate. Once these kids fail out of school, they are expected to financially contribute to their households but with no high school diploma, employment opportunities are often limited. At a minimum wage rate, they are forced to take on multiple jobs or, sadly, involve themselves in the illegal activities that the gangs offer. Our program's most recent graduation rate was 83%.

A year after opening our doors, a number of kids were hanging in, or around, the store at the end of every school day. Slowly, we realized that many of these kids had nowhere to go after school. Unfortunately, home for many of these kids are not safe spaces. Keeping them off the streets became a priority so we became that safe space for them. The program evolved into a tutoring and mentoring program where we provide the tools, support, and skills set necessary to graduate from high school. While the majority of our efforts are focused on their advancement into higher education, we are aware that a significant number of our participants will not attend college. A lack of familial financial support or access to funding play a large factor in their decision to postpone or pass on attending college. In an effort to provide these kids with an alternative to college, we developed the entrepreneurial program. The entrepreneurial program equips them with the tools needed to establish their own businesses and help them become more successful and productive citizens in our communities.

They know that Los Angeles abounds with opportunities for them to find jobs in the fields they love so much. With the proper training, they can begin working after graduating high school to help provide additional income & a more comfortable lifestyle to their families. Many of our East LA families live below the poverty level. These music & film jobs are unionized & pay far above minimum wage. This is a huge step up for many kids, whose immigrant parents work for minimum wages & are often mistreated by their employers.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "For two decades, Red Hen Press has provided outstanding arts education to students in underfunded schools through our WITS program. WITS places published poets in K-12 'Title 1' classrooms, leading creative writing workshops for youth who likely wouldn't have had the opportunity to learn and express their lived experiences through creative work. Funding from LA2050 will provide support for a transformative expansion of our WITS program. RHP is in the process of creating 'WITS HQ,' an arts education hub for underserved Pasadena youth. WITS HQ will equip students with creative and practical skills in the disciplines of book publishing, new media marketing, and audio storytelling. As students enter a world in which social media, editing, videography, and writing prove more valuable every year, WITS HQ will give them practical experience to create future avenues of employment (and hopefully further diversify the arts and publishing industries). In its first year, the fellowship program will provide up to ten high school students, who have been enrolled in WITS or equivalent coursework, to join the staff onsite and learn the trajectory of how a book goes from being written to acquired to published and marketed. Students will then exercise what they learn in pursuit of their own team-led publication projects, following every step of the traditional publishing process. Additional funds will go towards serving and expanding our regular WITS program to 450 students a year.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We believe change starts at the local level and with the youth. Our WITS service areas have included Pasadena, Hollywood, Inglewood, Nevin, and Pacoima. We've put free books of literature in over 4,000 students' hands over the years. Sometimes these books have been the only ones in their homes. Though WITS HQ, as outlined in this proposal, will affect the lives and career opportunities of up to ten underserved students in its first year, the program has the potential to grow. Once we have our capital needs met, such as purchase of media equipment, the program will be able to run sustainably and scale to reach more students, not only in the summer and not only in Pasadena. The literary industry needs more publishers and editors, especially from diverse backgrounds. Students today are the creators of tomorrow, and if our work is successful, there will be many more employed writers, artists, and publishers from all backgrounds in LA County's future.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "For our current WITS programming, we measure impact through polling our WITS instructors, host teachers, and students through pre and post-workshop surveys. Student evaluations include quantifiable questions about confidence in writing and public speaking, understanding of vocabulary, and interest in poetry. Host teacher surveys include questions about student performance and effectiveness of the curriculum. Of students surveyed, 69% felt more comfortable in a classroom environment, 70% developed an interest in writing poetry, and 77% of students reported improvement in their writing ability after participating in WITS. Teacher comments include: \"descriptive language use has flourished,\" \"confidence in writing has soared,\" and \"thank you for opening the world of creative writing. They will never forget this experience.\" We'll have even more intensive qualitative assessments for WITS HQ, including a mid-program survey and tracking student employment or college success upon graduation.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "National test results have shown striking drops in teenage students' math and reading scores, only exacerbated by online learning during the pandemic. Numerous studies show that arts education helps foster student engagement, attendance, and motivation to learn along with an improved school culture and climate. By participating in arts programs, economically disadvantaged and at-risk students are less likely to receive disciplinary infractions, are more likely to have higher reading and writing scores, and are more likely to be compassionate. Unfortunately, even with renewed effort in anticipation of Proposition 28, still only 11% of California schools fulfill the state requirement of providing arts classes to their students. Schools lacking these programs disproportionately affect minority and low-income students. Furthermore, the literary industry is in need of more diverse publishers and editors, but barriers to arts education keeps the industry populated by the white and wealthy."

The program targets middle and high schools, colleges and universities, local businesses, faith institutions, and other community agencies with individualized, age-appropriate engagements that thoughtfully educate attendees regarding the dynamics of IPV, the local resources that are available to them, and how to safely intervene when they or someone they know is experiencing IPV. Beyond presentations, the program creates safe spaces that encourage attendees to ask questions and share their own experiences, and has dedicated, on-site staff for crisis intervention and service referrals as needed. The program also assists in updating internal policies and procedures, training HR and administrative staff, and supports the implementation of trauma informed classrooms and spaces, minimizing the stigma surrounding IPV and supporting open and honest discussions among students, staff, and parishioners. This multi-pronged strategy is aimed to encourage community-driven prevention and early intervention efforts to protect ourselves from violence while freeing up capacity for service providers to prioritize treating advanced IPV cases.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "During the grant period, we will expand outreach through partnerships with LAUSD, the Boys & Girls Clubs, and local schools to exceed last year's engagement numbers (2,400 individuals) with focus on teens and transitional age youth. We expect to leverage these partnerships to expand the program countywide while capturing feedback to continuously improve our outcome measures. We will develop support groups for interested participants to share their lived experiences, and develop a mentorship program for youth modeled after our existing advocates program, where young survivors can share their experiences through public speaking engagements to bring awareness to teen dating violence. The program aims to support an increasing number of community members in protecting themselves from violence, while promoting a community-wide culture that actively discourages IPV.

This database tracks the number of engagements, attendees, topic(s) covered, case notes, and related metrics for review, reporting, and the development of outreach strategies. Qualitative data is gathered through pre- and post-surveys administered to all attendees of our presentations. Questions on the survey gauge individual understandings of IPV topics to see what participants may already know about IPV and what they have learned from our program. Open ended questions encourage feedback regarding how our engagements were effective, how they can be improved, and if there are any additional topics they would like to see moving forward.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men in the US are affected by IPV, but its pervasive yet discrete nature has been a challenge for prevention and intervention efforts nationwide. The LA Homeless Services Authority states survivors of IPV are the largest subset of the documented homeless population (39%). Despite this, only $8 million of the county's $975 million American Rescue Act spending plan for housing and homelessness was allocated to IPV services. The unaffordable rental market exacerbates this issue, leaving many low-income survivors with a difficult decision between continued abuse and homelessness. A single parent working full?time would need $39.58/hr to afford a two-bedroom apartment in LA County, 183% higher than the state's minimum wage (nlihc.org). As we implore policymakers to address the intersection of IPV and homelessness, we must make meaningful efforts to support prevention and early intervention to stop generational cycles of violence and poverty."

In sharp contrast, the LA County Office of Education counted 51,287 homeless students, including in this figure youth in families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; a more comprehensive metric than the one dictated for the Point In Time Count. Core causes of youth homelessness include aging out of foster care, family conflict or abuse, family rejection due to LGBTQ+ status, substance abuse, cost of housing, and systemic racism. The earlier homeless youth can be placed in safe housing and provided trauma-informed behavioral health services and life skills training, the more likely they are to recover from these experiences, create stable careers and grow into the future leaders of our communities.",

Youth unemployment has been cited as a contributing factor for rising income inequality. These realities are especially prevalent for youth who have experienced homelessness or have been in the foster care system. LA County has over 3,000 homeless TAY. Almost half of California foster youth are unemployed by age 21. Youth of color are disproportionately affected, comprising the majority of youth placed in foster care and/or experiencing homelessness.

Internships are available at our cafe, Rosebud Coffee, as well as with local business partners, including retail, construction, and landscaping. The TAY we work with often require additional guidance and a more supportive environment than their peers. Youth receive ongoing support throughout their internships as issues arise - often related to transportation, timeliness and people skills. We support them in finding the right tools to address these issues while emphasizing how crucial things like reliability and customer service skills are in job retention. Toward the end of the program, youth receive direct support in preparing for the job search process, such as guidance on using job search tools, tips for the application and interview process, and referrals to local job openings. We are also currently setting up a volunteer program to match youth graduates with a job coach and mentor to support them in job searching, job retention and basic life skills following program completion.",

Successful interns are ready for employment and find employment within 3-6 months following the internship and maintain employment for 6 months or more. This past program year, we began incorporating a self-reported assessment of soft skills and job-readiness which youth complete before and after our program.

    "yearSubmitted": "2023",
    "organization": "Jenesse Center, Inc.",
    "summary": "Jenesse strives to give survivors of domestic violence the skills, tools, and support they need to achieve self-sufficiency, transforming their lives through vocational training, entrepreneurship, and employment opportunities. Jenesse assists clients with all aspects of the employment process from resume development and interview readiness to workplace skills.",
    "goal": "CREATE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "South LA",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Empowering and educating domestic violence survivors on how to live a life free of violence not only impacts those victims and their loved ones but can have profound and positive reverberations on how communities and economies operate. Achieving economic equality for survivors leaves them less vulnerable to violence from an intimate partner, and financial stability improves their lives and their family. This, in turn, provides a significant overall economic boost for the community as a whole. The participants of this program will become productive members of the community who can create new opportunities for other members to develop new skills and secure meaningful jobs. Therefore, this program is a powerful tool for Jenesse in its fight against the economic inequality in Los Angeles County and to create a healthy just community for everyone.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Jenesse utilizes a variety of methods to ensure its programs meet performance targets and measures. Jenesse's Director of Compliance is responsible for ensuring that the agency's programmatic and operational activities are monitored on a regular basis. The outcomes of the program achieved in previous years show that the program is working, including: 90% report greater self-esteem and enhanced confidence in their ability in supporting themselves and their family; 80% report increased economic equity as evidenced by higher income, access to opportunities, and increased self-sufficiency; 70% of clients completing the program successfully obtain employment, initiate vocational/educational programs, or launch their own businesses; 50% of the clients start their own businesses, maintain business operations for a minimum of one year.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Economic equity is defined here as to how income and opportunities are distributed. For generations, Black residents have been cut off from social equity and economic equality by systemic racism and persistent societal failures of massive proportions. As a result, Black people earn less money than their white counterparts earn, inherit less wealth, and have access to a fraction of the assets and opportunities. This is true from health to education that commonly lead to white-collar careers that pay dividends beyond higher wages. In addition, a lack of employment and employable skills exacerbates the cycle of domestic violence (DV) by limiting viable options for self-sufficiency. Without a viable means of supporting themselves and their family, poor women of color who suffer from DV are at higher risk of remaining in violent households simply because they have nowhere else to go.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Jenesse's Workforce Development Program's mission is to give survivors of domestic violence the skills, tools, and support they need to achieve self-sufficiency and transform their lives. Our six-week hybrid Paid Work Experience Program is a new component of this program through which we assist clients: 1. who are struggling with unemployment due to COVID-19 and cannot access any other source of income or 2. who have no work experience and no GED or High School Diploma. We meet weekly in person and also via Zoom on the pads we provide the clients. The clients develop a professional portfolio at program completion and receive a $1200 stipend. There also will be a final writing piece on how clients plan to use what they learned from this program. Clients will develop ready-to-work attitudes/interview skills; financial literacy; knowledge of workplace safety and rights as workers; business operations; how to read an earnings statement and know what payroll deductions to expect; career decision-making; and make a career goal plan and much more. This program contains an integrated educational process that: (1) helps clients to choose a career path based on their interests and aptitudes; (2) prepares them for academic enrichment and career success; and (3) allows clients to learn to work with others in ways that are successful and rewarding. Jenesse also connects with our partners and business leaders to provide mentorship, resources, and job placement at program completion.",

Cities will also help disseminate event information to local residents. In addition, TreePeople will invite community businesses and nonprofits to host tables at our fruit tree distributions. This mutually beneficial relationship enables local organizations to perform community outreach, while also drawing more residents to the event to receive trees.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "California's economic crisis is creating a disproportionate impact on communities of color. As families trim costs, fresh food is often the first item cut from the budget, as they struggle to afford nonnegotiable expenses such as rent and utilities. Yet fresh food is essential to overall health. For vulnerable groups such as seniors and children, proper nutrition is critical for physical and emotional health and longevity. The same disadvantaged communities that lack sufficient fresh produce also face the worst environmental challenges. In these areas, pollution is high, environmental assets are low, and poverty and other socio-economic barriers are rampant. The consequences can be severe: Separation from nature is linked with behavioral issues, mood disorders, and physical health problems, such as anxiety, depression, obesity, diabetes, asthma, and respiratory ailments. Residents of these urban communities need a greener, shadier environment, along with access to fresh produce.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "TreePeople's Fruit Tree Distribution Program addresses the aforementioned needs by empowering residents to plant and care for fruit trees, thereby greening the urban environment, improving access to nature, and providing fresh food to low-income residents for years to come. TreePeople's Program consists of city-supported events that provide no-cost trees to low-income residents. All distributions are located in disadvantaged communities. During each event, interested participants register to receive a fruit tree. Upon registering, participants will choose what type of fruit tree they would like to receive. Varieties offered include lemon, lime, kumquat, orange, nectarine, peach, and plum, all of which thrive in Southern California's climate. Registered residents then participate in a short tree care workshop (provided in both English and Spanish) before receiving their tree. We will publicize each event through flyers distributed at schools and community organizations, and through our website. TreePeople will host Distribution events at community centers, schools, and/or parks in the partner Cities. These facilities are ideal locations because they typically include bathrooms, ample parking, and a safe space that enables set-up before the event. The day of each event, local vendors and community organizations set up tables in the area that contribute to the ambiance of each event, encouraging youth and adults to enjoy the surrounding greenspace and educational materials.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Project outcomes are tracked by TreePeople internal databases, including Salesforce. Quantitative project success is measured through results that include the number of fruit trees distributed, volunteers supporting the project, and community members engaged in no-cost distribution events. Qualitatively, TreePeople also evaluates community response to each project - not only based on the direct benefits of free fruit tree plantings, but on individual engagement regarding care for the urban forest and for the local environment. TreePeople launched the Fruit Tree Distribution Program in 1984, with the belief that everyone deserves access to fresh produce, access to nature, and a healthy environment. We have distributed thousands of trees to dozens of communities across Los Angeles County over the last 40 years, and have witnessed (and cataloged) the transformative impact this program has in nourishing our neighbors and creating lifelong stewards for our urban greenscapes.",

TreePeople's three long-term objectives through the Program for the communities served are: * Connection to the environment. Fruit trees offer a much-needed connection to nature for residents who lack access to green spaces. Planting and caring for fruit trees empowers residents to be good environmental stewards. * Greener, healthier communities. Fruit trees clean the air and provide much-needed shade, resulting in healthier, cooler, and more climate-resilient communities. They also prevent erosion and flooding by storing rainwater in their roots. * Increased food security and access to fresh food. Low-income residents who receive fruit trees will have access to free, fresh fruit for years to come, resulting in better nutrition and improved food security."

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "9. Created from activities from many of our existing programs, a four-hour weekly enrichment class was piloted. Ninety students from a local elementary school were offered this enrichment program from 1:00-5:30 on their early dismissal days through a grant from the LA County Department of Education. Students from TK (Transitional Kindergarten) to 8th grade participated. Parents were delighted with our program, commenting that their children became more independent and confident and came home talking about friends and shared experiences. Children celebrated all successes and encouraged everyone to keep trying. Students are delighted to share the new cooking class experiences, yoga and sports skills. Students ranged from special needs to gifted: all were shown opportunity and respect, and nearly all completely blended into this program. Those learning basic sports skills helped one another. Children, arriving afraid of the water, showed pride in their developing swimming skills.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "San Gabriel Valley",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "A positive self-image, feeling secure, and being mentally healthy are essential for anyone to be happy and succeed. Sports and teamwork provide the environment for understanding, acceptance and belonging. COVID-19 denied students the in-school experience of learning together and developing social skills and friendships. Sports were cancelled. Classmates became strangers. Special needs students were further isolated by having no access to mainstreaming activities. Falling behind and being isolated from others leads to stress and anxiety, as evidenced by the higher suicide rates among young people. In a program of a four-hour weekly enrichment day, 90 students came to our YMCA. They participated in sports and non-academic teamwork STEAM activities, eliminating the stress and anxiety of academics. Students cheered each other on as they learned and improved their baseball, basketball, and swimming skills. Students listened to each other. New leaders emerged, and the feeling of belonging",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Non-academic enrichment for children provides a different arena for students to explore. Academic underachievers will face different challenges, working with others and achieving success. Those strong in academics will face challenges outside the box not found in books, depending on teammates, communicating, and coming up with new solutions. Sports and physical activities give students a different opportunity to excel. Excellence will come with the combined efforts of others; their accomplishments are dependent on the success of others. Encouraging and celebrating the achievements of others creates friendships and belonging. These activities bring students out of isolation to a place where they depend on others, and others depend on them. The feeling of belonging and self-worth grows. We have piloted such a program at our Y. Students learn to work together to successfully achieve challenges, becoming friends and feeling like a team. We want to give this opportunity to other schools."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We aim to support Title 1 schools across grades K-12, where budgets are restricted, students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch programs, and may lack access to enriching experiences beyond their campus. Majorly, this project will prioritize Title 1 schools that primarily serve students from low-income and Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) racial and ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, this program will ensure accessibility for special needs students and students of varying physical abilities through providing a variety of education-based activities and modalities. By bringing the Magic Soil Bus and off-campus field trip opportunities at little to no cost for Title 1 schools, we aim to bridge the gap in access to educational resources, providing a unique and enriching experience that would otherwise be out of reach for these communities.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Throughout and at the end of the grant period, we will report progress on the number of schools reached through outreach and engagement, the number of off-campus field trips and technical assistance support that has been provided to schools, and the number of students, teachers, parents, stakeholders and community members engaged. Following all field trips, pre-post surveys will be provided to youth and teachers to determine if an increase in awareness and understanding of food and organic waste recycling, composting and soil health was attained. Beyond the grant period, after we have established a staff and student engagement network for school site composting, we will support schools to estimate the amount of organic waste diverted from landfills by students and their school campus communities, and calculate the greenhouse gas reduction equivalent.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our Youth Education Program will aim to engage 12 school communities and host 1-2 school visits and/or off-campus field trips for Title 1 schools and student groups with limited income budgets per month, for a total of 12-24 events. The Program's school visit component, The Magic Soil Bus, will act as a mobile educational hub, bringing the world within our soils to K-12 schools in Los Angeles County. Our team of dedicated staff educators will coordinate the bus to travel to different campuses, equipped with the knowledge and expertise to guide students and teachers through the transformative process of soil systems and foster a deeper understanding of sustainability and environmental stewardship among the younger generation. Funding for K-12 school bus transportation is a major hurdle for Title 1 schools to access off-campus field trip locations. To address this challenge, we plan to introduce a sliding scale scholarship plan that provides transportation to schools that lack the means to leave their campuses, allowing students to experience regional scale composting infrastructure and soil regeneration projects that extend beyond their campus.",

By organizing interactive Magic Soil Bus sessions and off-campus field trips, we will bring opportunity for scientific discovery, creative exploration and build authentic interest for food waste reduction and soil stewardship. Longer term, our Program will bolster a school composting network that supports youth to habitually take action in composting and waste reduction at their homes and on their campuses, and build age-appropriate STEAM and environmental science skills pertaining to decomposition, soil testing, microscopy, and calculating environmental impact. By making composting and food waste diversion accessible for youth, we will move entire communities closer to building sustainable habits and taking collective action.",

However, there is a real risk of this enclave being displaced--LA could lose this unique treasure. To help preserve our community, Destination Little Ethiopia recently won a federal grant of over $2 million to make our blocks of Fairfax Avenue more beautiful, walkable, and unique. But physical improvements alone will not make Little Ethiopia a more vital part of Los Angeles. We believe the planning process for this infrastructure upgrade offers a once in a generation opportunity to energize the Little Ethiopia community and to create vital links between our community and residents of surrounding neighborhoods, who ultimately support the businesses and benefit from their presence. By building a larger community, we can make Little Ethiopia a more vibrant asset for the entire City of Los Angeles. This grant will allow us to host a series of interactive events that will engage and inform the community.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If these improvements get implemented, it will create staying power and show that this is a community worth saving. As a nonprofit organization, it is difficult for us to contribute to the solution to the problem of displacement in more direct ways, since that would require a lot of capital to purchase properties to allow the existing tenants to remain. Los Angeles County would lose a gem of a community and the only concentrated, city-recognized community if we don't act by showing everyone how important this community is to us. Some of the Ethiopian Restaurants in the neighborhood are known for constantly receiving top honors on LA Times Best Restaurants List.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "As part of the Los Angeles Mayor's Great Street Initiative, community outreach was performed in 2018 and 2019. Since then, not only was the pandemic a disruptive setback, but the project has secured more funding for design and construction costs. Given this award, we believe it is our duty to re-engage the community to provide engagement on the coming infrastructure improvements. The funding awarded as part of this grant will include project costs not originally programmed in previous pursuits of funding. This award will directly and only apply to the Community Engagement and Outreach programming as part of the Signature Streetscapes & Green Alleys Project. The signature improvements will include the addition of brand-new Gateway Signage above Fairfax Avenue welcoming the community and Ethiopian-themed pedestrian lighting along Fairfax Avenue which will provide much needed late-night visibility. The Green Alleys scope of work includes re-imagining the alleys behind the properties on Fairfax Avenue to allow for stormwater infiltration and transformation of underutilized public space into a safe, attractive, and functional social environment.",

It is important to listen and incorporate how a community will react to an incoming project. Not only will the community live with the outcome of the improvements, but they can provide essential information that can lead to a successful outcome. Outreach and engagement events and workshop allow for immediate feedback to ensure the intention of the forthcoming work is received as intended. The project success will be shaped by these vital interactions. Our community-driven effort will rely on the relationships established with neighboring organizations including the Pico Neighborhood Council and the collection of neighborhood associations including Carthay Square, Wilshire Vista, South Carthay, Carthay Circle and others. Outreach Materials will also be produced in a variety of languages allowing for greater accessibility for communities not historically considered."

Only 58% graduate from high school and fewer than 8% achieve a bachelor's degree by age 26. Half end up homeless or incarcerated and/or unemployed. And nearly 50% of all CA children in foster care reside in Los Angeles County. These young adults often face significant skill and opportunity gaps, limited access to stable food and housing, inadequate healthcare, and involvement in the criminal justice system. The unique experiences of foster care and ACEs contribute to low self-esteem, limited coping mechanisms, and a lack of emotional and practical support systems. Targeted interventions are crucial to addressing these needs and empowering them to overcome barriers and thrive.",

Additionally, in a time when ~80% of Millennials & Gen Zers get their financial advice from social media, young people are especially vulnerable to the inherent risks of the persuasive, pressure-filled space of \"FinFluencers\", crypto icons, and get-rich-quick schemes online. As the second largest school district in the nation, with more than 84% of students living at or below the poverty line, LAUSD will benefit significantly from an innovative financial education program.

Additionally, we will host one major public event to celebrate program participants (and honor one student and teacher in particular!) and illuminate the need for more inclusive and pervasive financial education. There has never been a more important time to advance financial education, and we believe the best way to do so is through the transformative power of storytelling. By sharing an entertaining and thought-provoking film that highlights the financial stories of four young Americans -- three of whom are Angelenos! -- and providing a customized learning journey for viewers, we believe we can activate the youth of LA County to improve their financial health and future.",

Also, members of the public are invited to twice-monthly Ballona Wetlands walks and monthly habitat restoration events. In addition, school field trips and pre-trip presentations will connect thousands of children in grades 3, 4, 5, 6 (many from LAUSD Title 1 schools) to the Watershed. Staff and docents lead students through the wetland's four learning stations. Each student is issued a pair of binoculars to use while at the wetlands. Recruitment of participants will be through our library, community partners, and long-established school connections.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The Project activities aim to deepen participants' sense of place and belonging in the great outdoors. We believe that when people connect to nature in our city, they then seek ways to care for it. The very existence of these two sites is the result of community advocacy. Ballona Wetlands location had been under threat of real estate development. The public organized and fought for thirty years to save this rare coastal wetland. The Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve was established in 1995, and its 570 acres of biodiverse wetland habitat will remain as a home for wildlife and a nature resource for people in perpetuity. The Westwood Greenway was made possible through community efforts that turned a potential parking lot into a beautiful park, daylighting a long-buried creek along the Expo Line tracks. We hope to create a more diverse and inclusive voice in the environmental movement through stewardship training within this project, which includes monthly habitat restoration events.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Westwood Greenway - will provide access for NNI staff to lead a tour at the site. Los Angeles Public Library branches, including Baldwin Hills & Jefferson branches- where NNI will host workshops and community nature events building upon its long-term partnership with libraries. Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve - NNI has an agreement in partnership with Los Angeles Audubon Society to operate education programs at this site."

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Community Safety",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The initiative recognizes that community safety is a critical concern and aims to address this issue through a primary prevention approach. Rather than solely focusing on reactive measures after violence occurs, the initiative aims to address the underlying causes and risk factors that contribute to violence. By working \"upstream,\" the initiative will implement strategies and interventions that target the root causes of violence, such as addressing social inequities, promoting community cohesion, and providing opportunities for positive engagement. The initiative also aims to promote equitable access to outdoor areas, recognizing that underserved populations face barriers to accessing and benefiting from these spaces, such as economic disparities or social and cultural factors. To address these barriers, the initiative will implement strategies that ensure all residents have equal opportunities to enjoy and benefit from outdoor spaces regardless of their background or circumstances.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Central to the initiative is establishing the Upstream Azusa Working Group, an inclusive collaboration among stakeholders from diverse sectors united in their commitment to sustainable outdoor recreation and integrated land management. With the grant's support, the initiative will conduct comprehensive community needs assessments, delving deeply into residents' specific challenges and opportunities in accessing outdoor recreation. This thorough understanding will inform targeted strategies and interventions to address these barriers and ensure equitable access for all. Simultaneously, the working group will design and implement engaging recreational programming intricately linked to outdoor adventures. By fostering activities that promote physical health, well-being, and a sense of exploration, residents will be inspired and encouraged to actively participate in and reap the benefits of these outdoor spaces. This inclusive programming aims to enhance community engagement and create a vibrant and active outdoor recreation culture. Recognizing the immense power of engaged residents, the working group will prioritize the development of resident stewards of the environment. These individuals will be equipped with the necessary tools, resources, and support to actively contribute to the operation and maintenance of the recreational programming. Through their involvement, the stewards will develop a sense of ownership, responsibility, and pride in the community's outdoor spaces.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Suppose the work of the Upstream Azusa Initiative is successful. In that case, communities within the county will experience increased safety as the primary prevention approach of the initiative addresses the root causes of violence and promotes community cohesion. Reduced violence and crime rates will create safer neighborhoods and instill a sense of security for residents. Moreover, the initiative's focus on equitable access to outdoor areas and the development of recreational programming will enhance the overall well-being of Los Angeles County residents. Improved physical and mental health outcomes will result from increased access to natural spaces, opportunities for physical activity, and connections with nature. The initiative's success will also have positive environmental impacts, as integrated land management practices and the development of resident stewards promote sustainable environmental practices.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Partners and stakeholders will contribute their expertise and resources to its success. Serving on the working group, they will actively participate in decision-making processes, strategic planning, and collaborative efforts. These partners and stakeholders will also conduct assessments to gather valuable insights and feedback. Their perspectives will contribute to designing and implementing the initiative's programming. Additionally, they will assist in organizing and mobilizing volunteers for various initiatives, events, and community service projects. Through their collective efforts, these partners and stakeholders will contribute to the initiative's goal of enhancing community safety, promoting equitable access to outdoor areas, and fostering community well-being in Azusa.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The initiative places a strong emphasis on defining success through the active engagement of Azusa residents in the development of opportunities and recreational programming. The goal is to create a sense of ownership and to ensure that the initiatives truly meet the needs and aspirations of the community. To measure success, the initiative will closely monitor participation rates. By tracking the level of community involvement and active participation in the offered programs, events, and activities, the initiative can assess the extent to which residents benefit from the opportunities provided. Furthermore, the initiative will evaluate its effectiveness in creating a safer community by monitoring changes in crime rates. A decrease in crime rates, especially incidents of violence, will signify progress and suggest the potential influence of the initiative's activities in preventing and reducing such incidents.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In a 2017 study by the University of California, Berkeley, teachers said they spend less than an hour a week on STEM education. Less than half of principals say they believe their schools are adequately prepared to meet state science standards. Meanwhile, the public is inundated with depressing doomsday messages about climate change and the environment. When students come to the Aquarium on field trips, many tell us they've never been to the beach! Low-income parents face many obstacles when it comes to pursuing extracurricular activities that encourage STEM learning--language barriers, lack of transportation, and sometimes, a sense that they do not belong. Our goal is to eliminate those barriers by providing free transportation, a hot meal and an ocean-related toy or gift to bring home. We curate a natural phenomenon (a grunion run), which is a spectacle that visitors will never forget. It is simply not the same to read about this in a book.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We believe if parents share informal educational experiences with their children, they are more likely to support their child's interest in STEAM learning. We want everyone to feel welcome at our Aquarium regardless of their ability to pay. We want to embolden them to visit all of the other museums and cultural institutions our area has to offer. In this way, we can support informal STEAM education to supplement the formal curriculum students get at school, and hopefully, encourage them to pursue further studies and careers in STEAM. You can see visitors' eyes light up when they enter our Aquatic Nursery, where we grow our own phyto- and zooplankton and host the white abalone, one of the most endangered species on the planet. We talk to them about the giant sea bass, which can grow as large as a Volkswagen Beetle and live for 70 years. Our long-term goal is to get other institutions to offer a similar night each year.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "In 2022, we created LA Family Night at the Aquarium, which we plan to repeat and expand in 2024. We offered every council district in the the City of LA free bus transportation, a hot meal and an action-packed evening of STEAM education that included our four life-sized blowup whales, tours of our award-winning lab and exhibit halls, grunion hatching and a walk out to the moonlit beach to witness thousands of grunion hurl themselves onto the sand to mate. We sent each child home with a free book or ocean-themed toy. Without a doubt, it was an evening these families will never forget. Over two years, we welcomed approximately 6,000 children and their parents.to the Aquarium. Our blowup whales add to the event, allowing visitors to experience the massive size of a gray, humpback and blue whales. At 100 feet long, the blue whale is the largest creature on the planet earth.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The first LA Family Night, we filled 17 buses from nine of the 15 LA Council districts, with a total of 3,000 participants. The LAUSD Office of Outdoor Education loved the event so much that the second year, they funded the transportation matched the numbers. Aside from attendance and participation how do you quantify success for a program like this? You cannot fully calculate the impact of giving a child a brand-new book or the benefits that derive from their parents reading it to them time and time again. You cannot quantify the memories of standing on a moonlit beach with thousands of fish wiggling at your feet. Imagine the wonder of hatching your own grunion babies or seeing a sea horse for the first time. Imagine how cool it feels to enjoy your first treat from a food truck. Even the bus ride is significant to many families, who seldom get the chance to leave their neighborhoods due to the lack the resources and transportation. Imagine seeing downtown LA for the first time!",

We will keep records of the estimated numbers reached through outreach and the exact numbers of counseling clients. When we welcome new clients for counseling, we gather intake information which will give us a baseline on mental and physical wellness and lifestyle behaviors. About 6 months after the start of services we will conduct a follow-up interview with all individual clients to take a second measure of wellness and behavior.

In traditional South Asian culture, we think that a person with mental illness brings shame, is dangerous, and \"crazy\"- we ignore or hide the issue and dissuade ourselves from seeking help. And yet, immigrants carry a heavy emotional burden and face radical lifestyle changes that impact health behavior. Seniors suffer from isolation and the fear of foreignness. Women's visas force them into a situation of dependency upon their spouse, making them vulnerable. South Asian youth confront the anxiety of conflicting cultural values and 'model minority' expectations. Many immigrants consume excessive amounts of unhealthy foods in a strange new country. Immigrants are particularly prone to mental health disorders and chronic diseases but are among the last to seek and receive help.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Since 2019, Saahas (\"Courage\") has become a known and trusted service provider in the LA South Asian community. We work to reduce negative mental and physical health outcomes like anxiety, loneliness, isolation, diabetes, and heart disease. South Asians come to us when they would not dare to reach out to an American provider, worrying that they won't be understood, believed, or treated fairly. We speak their language and know their culture because we are South Asian too. Saahas also understands and works tirelessly to break down the stigma around mental health, domestic violence, obesity, and other public health subjects that are taboo in our community. With support from LA2050, Saahas is delighted to launch: (1)\tMental Health Support: (a) \"Women Helping Women\" group counseling that meets for 8 weekly sessions, and (b) Individual counseling/therapy sessions tailored to the needs and expectations of SAI clients. (2)\tNutrition and Exercise Support: Community outreach and one-on-one counseling on nutrition, exercise, body image, and self-esteem. This will join our existing yoga classes and dance sessions. These services are provided in a culturally relevant manner, free of charge to low-income SAI and their families. Saahas' will use its proven outreach techniques to identify potential clients in the community.

CASAs focus on making sure that appropriate services are coordinated and the child's needs are met, particularly around placement in a stable home, physical and mental health, and education. By building strong, trusting relationships with the youth they advocate for and getting to know the child's interests, talents, and aspirations, CASAS can make sure that the child's voice is heard and that their own wants are considered when developing plans to support them. CASAs' efforts are focused on ensuring that young people exit the child welfare and juvenile justice systems as soon as possible, avoid re-entry and recidivism, have everything they need to succeed in school, heal and learn to cope with their trauma, safely return to their communities, and have long-term supports in place for their future.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "People released from incarceration face a risk of opioid overdose 10 times greater than the general public and nearly two-thirds of all U.S. adults in custody have a substance use disorder. Young people aging out of foster care are also high risk: 40% will become unhoused within 18 months; 81% of young men will become incarcerated; 71% of young women will become pregnant before age 21, with their children placed in foster care themselves, perpetuating the cycle. These vulnerable young people need special support to avoid adverse outcomes while becoming economically and emotionally self-sufficient. YPR's programs enhance behavioral health and mental well-being by focusing on the four dimensions that all young adults need to thrive: health, home, community, and purpose. By empowering participants to become more engaged in their life-planning through positive goal setting, harm reduction, and leadership development, YPR equips young people to take charge of their futures.",

People will return to school and/or find employment; be better equipped to prevent opioid overdose and overdose deaths; will report improved behavioral health outcomes such as fewer reoccurrences of substance use, reduced problematic substance use, and/or negative impacts from substance use. In the long-term, YPR hopes to expand its base among systems-impacted young people in East LA and Pasadena, particularly among LatinX participants. By becoming better-known as a resource for those with prior criminal justice involvement and those aging out of the foster system, YPR can offer help and support when and where it's needed most, reducing recidivism, overdoses and overdose deaths, creating more resilient young adults who are better equipped to make positive decisions and take action to improve their futures.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "YPR chapters in East LA and Pasadena will implement harm reduction education and supply distribution; life-skills curriculum programs; and pro-social events so systems-impacted youth and young adults can find an alternative peer group that supports their health, wellness, and upward mobility. Events will teach harm reduction as an approach to preventing overdose improving physical, mental, and social wellbeing. Each participant will be given free naloxone and fentanyl test strips as well as information about other strategies such as syringe exchange programs, and \"never use alone\" initiatives to reduce overdose deaths. YPR will also provide a life-skills curriculum program for up to 75 participants annually at both locations (East LA and Pasadena). YPR's curriculum addresses life planning around multiple domains such as: education, housing, employment, personal finances, leadership, and recovery messaging. After completing the curriculum, participants are better able to set goals for themselves such as going back to school or getting a job; improve their understanding of personal finances; and are more dedicated to their behavioral health and wellness. The chapters will offer pro-social activities such as bowling, hiking, paintball, etc. on a monthly basis and will implement all-recovery meetings that are welcoming of all recovery pathways on a weekly basis. All activities will be offered in both English and Spanish and are 100% free of charge to participants.",

The Inland Empire Chapter held 7 pro-social activities for 98 participants including movie nights, holiday parties, and basketball tournaments in collaboration with Youth Moving On, which serves youth aging out of the foster system. YPR's East LA Chapter collaborated with Homeboy Industries and MELA Counseling Center to provide 7 pro-social activities for 227 young people, including those with lived criminal-justice involvement. YPR also started implementing the Recovery Capital Index in January, an online, evidence-based tool that provides a more holistic picture of participants' wellbeing, measuring improvements in areas like social support, healthy lifestyle, housing, education, and employment.",

For immigrants and refugees to fully integrate and thrive, they must be given the skills, resources, and support to address language access issues, barriers to social and economic mobility, lack of civic representation and participation, and barriers to naturalization. Giving this underserved group a voice is the first step to opening up the dialogue in L.A. County, starting necessary conversations about issues that matter most to them.

Ensuring that students have the resources they need in school contributes to a healthy built environment, creating a safe space for youth and families to accommodate their daily needs. Giving immigrant leaders the freedom and self-determination for funding decisions allows them to make a more immediate impact.

Kid City students concur, and have repeatedly noted the need for more peaceful outdoor spaces like our new \"Breezeway.\" Kid City participants and Breezeway designers are representative of multi-generational families in metro Los Angeles; they are first generation students from low-income, mixed-status families with little or no access to safe, green, outdoor space. Per the LA County Parks Needs Assessment, metro Los Angeles has a \"very high need\" for parks.

As Kid City lives into its first year of programs in the Breezeway, this demonstration project will document the way green outdoor space brings people together in new ways - preschoolers next door, residents of three adjacent affordable housing complexes (designated for persons with disabilities, seniors, and families), the students who created and maintain it, and their family members. Programs may include: art and gardening workshops, demonstrations by and for architecture and design students, and community gatherings. The space may also be used for personal reflection, study, and informal gatherings. New features will teach new concepts: mosaics designed using biomimicry, vertical low-water gardens, sustainable water features, and shade. Interns from ASU's Learning Futures Studio will create an immersive virtual teaching tool that will document the development of the Breezeway from conception to every day use. It will demonstrate how high school and college students learn geometry, math, botany, design, research, and community facilitation skills - all to bring a multi-purpose green space to life. Educators will see how dual enrollment in architecture courses opens up STEM careers to high school students. CBO's and public entities will learn how they can collaborate to give constituents the power to design, build, and maintain their own public green spaces.",

Beautiful gardens with trees and native plants, designed to serve hyper-local needs of nearby residents will replace abandoned lots filled with trash. As Los Angeles residents conceptualize, design, and work together, pride and ownership of public green spaces will become the norm. Educational institutions and affiliated professional organizations will work together to introduce students of all ages to the tools to build the green spaces that fit the needs of their own neighborhoods. Students from historically underrepresented communities will be motivated, as they themselves take part in the creation of these spaces, to enter design, building, and architecture fields in greater numbers. Community space in central and south Los Angeles will be transformed.",

Students are taking ownership - helping to maintain and refine landscaping. Staff feel revived after spending 30 minutes outside, over lunch, or just meeting with students. Professor Marcela Oliva is showing the Breezeway to colleagues and students to demonstrate a successful community design project. Breezeway designers whose college applications were strengthened by their Breezeway experience have enrolled in UCR and Caltech. Other Breezeway designers have obtained internships in the field. Future measures for success will include the number of people visiting the space, the length of time they spend in the space, and the number of students and professors who access the virtual platform. The ultimate impact will be the development of more spaces like the Breezeway that bring safe outdoor recreational space to low-income communities that lack it."

Black male teachers, for example, represent only 2% of the national teacher workforce. Research shows when Black kids in grades 3-5 experience a Black Male teacher, achievement in both math and reading significantly increases, graduation rates increase by 39%, and the dropout rate decreases by 29% Teacher Village disrupts this cycle with an innovative approach to recruitment and retention of prospective Black male teachers who will, in turn, serve as success models for some of the most vulnerable educational demographic, young Black males.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Teacher Village's goal is to improve the pipeline gap for Black male educators in Los Angeles County, which will in turn improve educational and social emotional learning outcomes for all children, and especially Black male children. Over the next ten years, TV will reach full capacity, training 10, 1st year fellows and 10, 2nd year fellows, at a time. This will yield 100 new, fully credentialed and experienced Black male teachers by 2033. 100% of the Black male teachers will have successfully completed the TV training, will be debt free from their credentialing program and be homeowners living in the neighborhoods they serve by their 3rd-5th year of teaching. Finally, increasing the number of Black male teachers will improve school climate and achievement. Specifically, we expect a significant increase in Black students meeting both literacy and math benchmarks and, eventually, an increase in graduation rates for the students who matriculate through school with our teachers."

For example, in 2023-24, we are working on researching a case with the Bureau of Field Enforcement (BOFE) involving an employer with 30 workers at two locations. Also, despite the fact that we fought and won the creation of a Wage Restitution Fund, many workers find access to these funds difficult to obtain. Our plan is to streamline and fix these policy implementation issues. 2- Upgraded Car Wash Worker Health & Safety Curriculum: Training workers about health and safety at the workplace which continues to be a problem as COVID created new health standards are often not followed by company owners. 3- Car Wash Mobile Entrepreneurship : We plan to create a new training module on how to register and operate their own mobile car wash.

For example, we contributed to the founding of Public Health Councils Program, created by the County to help workers monitor workplace compliance issues with local COVID-19 regulations. In 2020, the Department of Public Health completed studies highlighting four top-risk industries during COVID: food manufacturing, apparel manufacturing, warehousing/ storage and restaurant industries.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In LA County, an estimated 500 carwashes employ around 10,000 carwasherxs. Car washes are a part of the vast underground economy in car-centric cities across California. Many car washes fail to follow basic labor, health, and safety laws. Long hours in the heat, abrasive and toxic chemicals and no drinking water or refusal of rest breaks are commonplace in car wash businesses. Carwasherxs, or car wash workers, are rarely paid the minimum wage. Many also report working solely for tips -- a flagrant violation of local and federal labor laws. Our daily work is a conscious response to the dire financial crises many carwash workers often experience as evidenced in recent years. Car wash workers are a large segment of our workforce affected by the pandemic as well as climate change. The unusual ongoing storms, rainy and cloudy weather not seasonally found in Los Angeles County and SoCal weather have led to a tremendous drop in the car wash customer base in 2023."

For example, people in Beverly Hills live 12 years longer than people in Watts. They also have lower rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Green space access correlates to public health benefits, including lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, lower self-reported stress, lower rates of crime and domestic violence, and improved air and water quality.

Our participatory planning work is based on four pillars: organizing, design, development, and stewardship. We start with deep community engagement and stakeholder involvement, where residents share their vision and priorities for their neighborhoods. We then create parks and gardens that reflect their needs and preferences. We also train residents to become urban land stewards who care for and manage their green spaces. We keep our parks active by providing free programming that focuses on health and wellness, such as nutrition, gardening, Zumba, and art classes. We also organize events and workshops that promote park access and community-building, such as public safety planning, vacant lot transformation, youth leadership development, and education.

When Operation Jump Start achieves its mission, it will help create a more skilled and productive workforce who will have the means to make a positive economic impact.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Although we are not applying for a collaboration grant, OJS believes that collaboration is key to providing the best services while maximizing our resources. We have long standing partnerships with the Long Beach Unified School District and The City of Long Beach. For over 10 years, we have partnered with California State Universities at Long Beach, Dominguez Hills and Northridge who provide us with the master's level social work interns that provide our mental health services, in 2014 Simmons College became a partner in this program and this year we added University of Southern California, Fordham University and Walden University as our partners. For more than a decade, we have been active in the Southern California College Access Network (SO CAL CAN).",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 250",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The College Success program addresses the needs of low-income, first-generation college students. In 2010 the program served less than 20 students, in the 2022-2023 academic year, we served 208 students. Our expansion goal is to increase the number of students served to 500 by 2026. The program uses a two-fold approach to assist our vulnerable students as they work towards the goal of a college degree. The first is to fully prepare current high school students for challenges they will face preparing to begin their college education, and supporting them throughout this stressful process. Once college admission is obtained, the program provides individualized case management to meet the specific needs of each college student. Our students outperform other students of similar socioeconomic backgrounds in their attendance at four-year colleges immediately following high school, their college graduation rates and their overall persistence rates in higher education.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "OJS is witness to the ongoing unmet need for college access programs and services for middle school, high school, and college students. Our organization seeks to improve and change the lives of promising youth from disadvantaged areas who dream of attending and graduating from a college or university. Although the graduation rates have significantly improved in Long Beach for our population, those who do graduate are not always properly prepared to pursue a college education. As evidenced by the most recent results of the California Assessment of Student Progress Test, less than 42% of economically disadvantaged 11th-grade students in Long Beach meet or exceed expected standards in English and only 13% score proficient or advanced in Math (California Department of Education, 2022)."

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The impact of our program is best said by one of our participants: \"Just being outside here, away from the shelter, away from the cement everywhere, the helicopters, the gunshots - it's nice just to relax. During our meditation I looked up and I realized we're not alone. There's a tree here with us and it's a haven for hummingbirds. And there's a spider web up there. I realized that that web was made because that spider is hungry, just like we all need food. We're all alive and trying to get by. It made me think that I have my own cycle too.\" Quantitatively, we measure program effectiveness at introducing new preventative behaviors, as well as general mindset as a result of the program. Participants attend classes for varying amounts of times, so we have short-term and long-term outcomes that we are seeking, from immediate behavior change to the longer-term impacts on mental health & wellbeing. We are also working with academic institutions to improve on our program evaluations.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "More than 80% of homeless individuals report having experienced life-altering trauma at some point in their lives, leading to a high percentage who have experienced symptoms of PTSD, substance-use disorders, disconnection from family and friends, depression, and unemployment. As such, it is critical that we provide a holistic and integrated approach to healing for individuals who are experiencing homelessness. This approach is oftentimes only available through very costly private healthcare. Using our 1.5 acre farm, GrowGood has developed an ecotherapy program that is specifically designed for individuals who are experiencing homelessness, are in recovery, and/or have co-occurring disorders (diagnosed & undiagnosed). There are a myriad of proven benefits of connecting with nature, including the reduction of anger and depression, and improvements to mood, self-confidence, and overall health. The programs teach mental health tools that are immediately beneficial to the participants.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We are working to further develop an evidence-based model of ecotherapy specific for individuals who are experiencing homelessness, and using urban farms as the nature-based connection. With funding, we will be able to pilot the different pillars of this unique mental health model, which include the following components: mind-body (meditation & movement), nutrition, art/creativity, and community. We have already created a teaching guidebook for our mind-body pillar, and are in the process of developing corresponding student handbooks. We also plan to use grant funds to further expand our outcome tracking using qualitative and quantitative methods, and toward this goal, as we pilot each additional pillar, we are working with academic experts to create an aligned framework and curricula. Additionally, it is our ultimate goal to be able to replicate our ecotherapy program at other homeless service sites.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "South LA",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The GrowGood Ecotherapy Wellness Program is the only ecotherapy program in the LA area with access to a purpose-built outdoor facility adjacent to a homeless shelter. Our program teaches nature-based mindfulness through meditation, movement, art, nutrition, & connection to nature to reduce stress, treat anxiety, and combat depression. All of our participants are enrolled in programs at The Salvation Army's Bell Shelter, including a Drug MediCal Residential Recovery Program, Permanent Supportive Housing, and Crisis & Transitional/Bridge Housing. The participants receive social services case management from the Bell Shelter, and our program is supplemental to provide additional mental health & healing support. In 2023, we anticipate providing 1,800 individual instructional hours of mindfulness-based programming. All of our programming is centered around connection to the natural world through engagement at our 1.5 acre-urban farm. To-date, we have developed a mind-body curriculum, and will soon be creating student handbooks for this class. In June 2023, we are launching our Art x Nature mindfulness classes, & will be developing a specific curriculum for this topic in partnership with a Community Health graduate student. With funding, we will also launch our first nutritional component by creating a \"blender bike\" program where participants can create their own grab & go smoothie using ingredients from the farm while also learning healthy eating habits."

Children in foster care in the U.S. are ethnically and racially diverse: some 44% are White, 23% Black, 21% Hispanic, 8% two or more races and 2% Native American. About 10% have been in the foster care system for more than five years. Approximately 25% suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Children in foster care need stability, encouragement, love, acceptance, and support from their families and communities. Most youth entering foster care arrive carrying little more than the clothes on their backs. If they are afforded the opportunity to collect any personal belongings, many are given trash bags in which to carry them. Comfort Cases, Inc. aims to eliminate this demoralizing practice throughout this country, particularly in areas like LA that have a high number of children in care. Having to carry belongings in bags meant for trash has a profound effect on self-esteem and can cause feelings of worthlessness.",

Of the more than 437,000 children currently in foster care in the U.S., 3 in 10 will finish high school, <3% will go on to graduate from college, and 1 in 5 will wind up homeless after aging out. This grant affords the distribution of 1,300 Comfort Cases ($55 each to produce) in Los Angeles County. We will host one or more \"packing parties\" where Founder Rob Scheer will provide a motivational and inspiring speech.

The improvement of community safety can help remediate some of these outcomes, and even prove to be beneficial in improving quality of life for the inhabitants of our marginalized black and brown communities. Community safety is having accessible streets and curbs, removal of graffiti to improve community presence, and clean accessible green spaces. Individuals within neighborhoods lacking community safety often exhibit symptoms such as stress, depression, and anxiety. These negative side effects can be remediated through community presence and involvement. Active engagement in community cleanup activities, educational community events, and coalition building activities help to create this sense of community. The outcome of the supplementation to this deficit of community safety results in a resilient thriving community empowered by change.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Within our initiative there are projects that have been implemented for a few years such as the community cleanups, community beautification and health programs like yoga and Zumba, where as projects like our 311 information distribution events are something that is relatively new to our programming. As far as our previously implemented projects we have measured our success through the narratives of those constituents whose communities we serve. Our monthly community meetings are a dedicated space for the conversations of the impact we are creating within out target communities. We are in the process of creating surveys that will be able to measure the satisfaction of the communities served as well as individuals having participated in our projects. With this survey we hope to project more quantitive information as most of the impact has been measured by qualitative data, through experiences and narratives of those directly affected by our projects.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our community safety initiative aims to lessen the byproduct of neighborhoods lacking community safety within our marginalized BIPOC communities and overall supplement the identified deficits within our communities. The initiative is composed of three main projects that we are planning to provide, the first being our 311 campaign which consists of distribution of information regarding free city services such as bulky item pick ups, fixing of non functioning street lights, sidewalk repairs, and much more. We will also be conducting monthly community clean ups, as a part of this 311 campaign, where we identify an area in need of this cleanup service. In our cleanups we gather volunteers from the community who are interested in participating, following our outlined plan, and after congregating for a community brunch where we continue the conversation about focus areas, needs in the community, or simply serve as a healing circle. Our second project is providing programs in a safe community environment for all ages which will consist of aerobic activities such as Yoga, Zumba, and similar exercises. Having these outlets for individuals to express themselves in a safe space promotes mental health, physical health, and an overall sense of community. The third project consists of green space beautification, whether it be in front of someone's home or the local park. Improved public spaces can help deter crime as well as promoting mental health and increasing mobility and access.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In our area of service being South Los Angeles we hope to create a positive impact on our historically marginalized communities, reducing the amount of factors contributing to negative consequences on a mental and physical level. Through our community safety initiative we are applying a holistic approach in efforts to combat the current deficits within the community, all while creating a coalition of interested individuals which will continue to outlive the span of this grant. Specifically within our short term goal we hope to conduct a total of 7 community cleanups, beautifying 4 alley ways, conduct a total of 12 311 campaign information distribution events, and providing at least 2 aerobic programs in safe community spaces. Our long term goals for this project would be to improve the quality of life through community beautification, distribution of information that can be used beyond the end our this grant so that individuals can continue this work of community advocacy on their own."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Whether preparing for neurosurgery, experiencing hearing loss for the first time, or learning to manage a diagnosis, sensorineural hearing loss, conductive hearing loss and mixed hearing loss patients and their families face significant medical stressors. These stressors can negatively affect mental health and emotional well-being with lifelong implications. The social isolation and exclusion that often stem from hearing loss are linked to higher rates of depression in the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Further, the average annual income of those with hearing loss is $20,000 less compared to their normal-hearing counterparts. Hearing loss also correlates to learning and achievement gaps in youth and research shows that 25-35% of children with hearing loss are at risk of falling at least one grade level behind. On average, more than 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents, families who may be unprepared for the challenges of navigating their child's medical conditions.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "HIF's effectiveness can be measured qualitatively by our patient and family services' successes, which may be as simple as scheduling a referral appointment the parent was unable to or as significant as helping a newborn get needed medical hearing health treatment. We carefully track the number and types of services provided to each of our patients and their families and are implementing a survey to better understand the degree of benefit and satisfaction derived from the program. It will provide an additional measure of impact and allow us to incorporate feedback as we continuously look to strengthen our patient services program. Through patient feedback received to date, HIF increased the number of bilingual services and resources provided through the program to increase its accessibility.

Alongside our quality hearing-related disorder treatment and hearing loss prevention care, patients of all ages receive comprehensive resources, compassionate guidance, mental health support, whole family education and counseling, advocacy training and referrals in a supportive one-on-one setting, free of charge. We partner with hospitals, physicians and school districts and have curated a robust referral system and network of local partnerships and community resources to ensure patients and families have affordable access to any recommended services that are not provided in-house. The program assists our most vulnerable patients, those who are on Medi-Cal or CCS insurance, with often life-changing services. HIF recently launched a Hearing Aid Access Project (HAAP) to provide free hearing testing, hearing aids, hearing aid fittings, and bilingual education on hearing aid use and care. Hearing aids often cost upwards of $7,000 and are usually uncovered by insurance. HAAP assists patients who are unable to afford the hearing aids they need. We expect the number of patients and their families served by the HIF patient support services program to double in 2023, as we grow our capacity and prepare to extend programming to our HAAP patients. To extend quality care and services to all in need, HIF must increase our program budget.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Without early hearing loss detection and intervention, delays in language development increase exponentially. Despite a wealth of resources in L.A., there remains a lack of available centers to serve its youngest and most vulnerable patients in a timely way. Expanded HIF care will reduce wait time for diagnostic tests and services. With additional funding, HIF can provide more of Los Angeles' underinsured or low-income patients hearing devices through HAAP, free of charge. Most hearing health facilities do not offer the wrap-around services HIF provides. We guide families and navigate the hearing health system with them to utilize the resources available to them. Increasing HIF's patient services will improve access to and education for underserved communities (language or income), as well as patient outcomes in listening and spoken language, fluency and well-being. With early intervention, we can positively affect a lifetime of suffering from Adverse Childhood Events (ACES)."

This generation of youth faces some of the greatest challenges in U.S. history, including poverty, low literacy, struggles in their mental health, and community safety issues. According to the State of California, only one in every five California public schools offers a full-time arts or music program. In the last decade, arts and music programming has become non-essential in the eyes of most public school districts, when they are faced with state-wide budget cuts and the prioritization of standardized testing. Children who are regularly exposed to art perform better in literacy, math, and speech, and also develop better critical thinking skills. These children are more confident, have higher self-esteem, and show empathy when interacting with their peers. This makes afterschool art programming essential to today's youth.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "POPeretta!'s vision for successful outcomes includes our participants' ability to process and problem-solve personal conflicts through the use of music, as well as stage character development. In POPeretta!, youth participants write and direct their own opera scenes, based on real-life conflicts they face. This scene is then showcased in a final performance for the students' mentors, teachers, family members, and peers. Showcasing their artistic works on stage provides a secondary source for community healing, understanding, and celebration. POPeretta! includes ample opportunities for program evaluation and outcome measurement. This includes focus group discussions and surveys from program instructors and administrators. POP intends to expand the program in 2025, with a goal to serve 1,000 children. Featuring the students' work in professional theater settings for larger audiences will create more empathy, celebration, and understanding of the lives of Los Angeles youth, globally."

They also found that the racialized sexual exploitation of people of color during slavery and colonization still impacts cultural expectations and beliefs today about the availability and use of children of color for commercial sex. This leads to the \"adultification\" of Black girls as well as stereotyping them as hypersexualized, and thus consenting to their victimization. There are a myriad of services available for youth who have already been victimized, but there is grave need for more work around preventing victimization of our black girls to begin with.

We serve youth ages 12-21, with a focus on at-risk youth of color, as well as teachers, administrators, social workers, staff, and parents. Our training is designed to raise awareness about human trafficking, how to recognize the signs of trafficking and recruitment, and offer safety tips. We want to meet youth where they are and provide multiple touchpoints in which they can access our training. Expanding this program will allow us to make training available in schools, youth community centers, and group homes. Our goal is to provide consistent support in the community, establishing ongoing partnerships with each agency, and delivering multiple trainings to their youth and staff on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. To ensure youth are receiving relevant information, TPP first conducts discovery meetings with agencies interested in training. During this meeting, partner agencies share pain points and challenges they are facing as it relates to human trafficking. TPP then guides the agency through a menu of PowerUp training options that can assist in addressing their needs. As needed, we can co-present with interpreters for youth needing spoken interpretation as well as sign language.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "There are a myriad of services available in Los Angeles County for youth who have already been victimized. But there has been a lack of concerted effort around prevention. Also, the services that are available can only be accessed by agencies that partner with the County, leaving other youth community organizations and schools without access to this critical training. TPP serves the community as a whole and provides training wherever it is needed. Some of the limitations in other human trafficking prevention programming include sharing a limited view of sex trafficking and a lack of diversity in voices around this issue. TPP takes a more inclusive approach to prevention and education. Our innovation lies in developing training that addresses multiple topics related to trafficking and is applicable to all genders and ethnicities, but we are intentional about highlighting black girls and changing the narrative that they are in need of less protection than girls from other ethnicities.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "All attendees will be asked to complete a Likert-scale survey to measure their baseline understanding of program objectives. This information is compared to responses to the same questions at the conclusion of the training session. In addition, attendees are asked to write in responses speaking to how they plan to put what they have learned into practice and providing feedback on possible improvements of the training. The measurable goals are: 80% of participants will be able to identify at least 3 risk factors that could lead to sexual exploitation 80% of participants will be able to identify at least 3 key indicators of child sex trafficking 80% of participants will be able to identify at least 2 ways in which to provide trauma-informed support to youth The training program is considered effective if approximately 80% of participants who complete the survey mark an average score of 3 or higher on the post test, indicating an increase in knowledge of human trafficking."

The classes will allow them to \"hold\" their own regardless of who they are or where they are from. Many of our youth are perceived in negative view and lacking self-discipline, self-control, little or no self-worth. Basic life skills are no longer available in our school systems nor taught in the homes. We want to help eliminate a generational obstruction. We strongly believe if you know better, you do better! The knowledge and skills learned would assist our participants on their life journey. Our goal is to prepare our youth with knowledge and skills for their future when living on the own, instilling confidence, self-worth, social skills, and knowledge. Having self-confidence, self-worth and lucrative mindsets would not only benefit the students but, their guardians, their households, schools, and the community.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The social and life skills are no longer taught in our schools and our youth are in desperate need of them on their life journey. The first impression made is crucial, especially in the workforce. Our youth should be able to \"hold\" their own regardless of who they are or where they are from, their background, upbringing, and financial situation. Good social and etiquette skills are essential for job and educational interviews. Your first impression happens only once. Many will continue life on their own and should be successful. The age range of the youth was selected because social and life skills are crucial for the older group entering the workforce and/or higher educational institutions. The youngest age of 7 was determined due to the fact this is the age which I was taught and have retained and performed these skills. The earlier the youth are taught allows the youth to apply and cultivate the lessons. Our alumni youth are required to volunteer for this and other programs."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "This program is an expansion of Community Lawyer's Inc.'s (CLI) existing special education legal clinic to serve more clients utilizing dedicated staff and by seeking CLI's admission to the LA Superior Court Juvenile Division panel. Currently, CLI offers limited Special Education legal clinics led by pro bono attorneys and the organization's Executive Director who is a practicing children's rights attorney. These legal clinics provide counsel, advice, and representation in matters relating to the educational rights of children with disabilities and their caregivers. As a result of capacity limits, CLI staff are currently only serving 6 special education clients despite the organization's expertise in this area of law. Program expansion will allow CLI to increase the number of clients served more than threefold by hiring a specialized attorney, increasing existing staffing allocations to conduct community outreach to area non profit organizations serving systems impacted youth, and seek panel admission on the LA Superior Court for the newly hired attorney. Importantly, this program is both scalable and sustainable. As a result of the Federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), when a client prevails in their legal issue with a school district, the district is responsible for paying the plaintiff's attorney fees. This means that within one year of program expansion, CLI will be able to fully self-sustain the program.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "This program increases the number of legal service resources for systems impacted youth with special education needs and supports improving educational and life outcomes for systems impacted youth. Program success means improved youth educational and life outcomes, which will in turn result in decreased monitoring by and participation within County systems. As such the program will also contribute to alleviation of strain on County entities including the Department of Children and Family Services and Probation Department. In short, additional resources for systems impacted youth will directly benefit not only clients participating in the program, but the County as a whole by decreasing the burden on an overworked and imperfect County social service and carceral system which often contributes to the deterioration of quality of life for systems impacted youth.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "CLI measures success by evaluating whether or not the organization is able to secure a successful remedy of the legal issue(s) clients experience. For this program's clients, this means ensuring they are receiving the most ideal educational placement, receiving appropriate assessments by school and systems personnel, are placed in the least restrictive educational environment, and/or that community continuity is maintained across home placements. For example, CLI recently achieved a settlement from a school district that agreed to rescind SARB (Student Attendance Review Board) proceedings of a child who was experiencing school phobia due to trauma and instead provide him with intensive mental health services to meaningfully, compassionately, and appropriately address the underlying issues impacting the child's school attendance.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 20",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Systems impacted youth include youth in foster care, the juvenile delinquency system, students subject to exclusionary discipline, and youth at risk of restrictive placement (group homes, residential placements, detention, hospitalization). While systems impacted youth experience staggering disparities in educational outcomes, the likelihood for positive educational outcomes declines further for systems impacted youth that have special education needs. Negative outcomes are often the result of educational instability including frequently changing schools, inability to access appropriate assessments, placement in overly restrictive educational environments, and/or inappropriate school placement. Educational instability directly correlates to lower rates of graduation, negative mental health outcomes, and social and emotional developmental delays. As such, advocating for appropriate educational needs is critical to improving positive life outcomes for systems impacted youth.",

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Green Space, Park Access, and Trees",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Angelenos with indigenous roots are often excluded from consideration in greenspace development. Newly arrived immigrants, especially those from remote indigenous cultures, have experienced multiple layers of loss, leaving behind multigenerational communities of support and severing essential relationships to the natural world. Indigenous populations often understand wellbeing differently than the Western biomedical model, emphasizing a connection to the land and utilizing plants for physical and spiritual healing as well as preservation of culinary traditions. Los Angeles, a city of immigrants, is in need of greenspaces that not only promote health and play equity - but also serve as instruments to preserve community cultural wealth. A multigenerational greenspace that integrates indigenous plant cultivation with play and learning opportunities would help LA's immigrants build community and maintain cultural ties while serving as a model to support immigrants on a municipal level.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "PILAglobal regularly relies on qualitative feedback in the form of participant questionnaires and interviews to assess the effectiveness of our programs. In order to evaluate the success of the Nest LA Greenspace, we plan to develop a user survey that captures visitors' experiences. The Greenspace design will be developed and evaluated in line with the following objectives set forth by RIOS to be considered in addition to our goals for cultural responsiveness and play equity: Biophilia: Supporting access for people to nature and nature's sounds to promote personal and collective well-being; Increased biodiversity through introducing pollinator planting as part of a larger network to heal our natural systems; Heat mapping: Promoting shade equity with planting and tree canopy to create cooler conditions. RIOS recommends a review following 1 year of garden growth, maintenance, and use to obtain user feedback, make appropriate substitutions and address changes in stakeholder needs.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Nest LA Greenspace will be a multifunctional outdoor area on the campus of Refugee Children Center (RCC), a nonprofit organization providing holistic services to migrant families in LA. This summer, PILAglobal is partnering with RCC to open Nest LA, a free education program for migrant families. With support from LA2050, PILAglobal and RCC will expand their partnership to include the Nest LA Greenspace. Designed by international design firm RIOS, the Nest LA Greenspace will transform an empty corner of the property that houses RCC into a lush oasis with two unique features: a garden of plants native to Central America and a multifunctional outdoor play area and classroom. Plants meet medicinal, spiritual, and culinary needs in Central American cultures, healing a range of physical and mental health conditions. The Greenspace will offer LA's immigrant community-many of whom have lost all access to the natural world-a place to cultivate and harvest plants that carry great cultural importance. The space will also feature an outdoor classroom and play area, allowing PILAglobal, RCC, and other community stakeholders to host classes, workshops, and information sessions for visitors in a natural, nurturing space. By celebrating indigenous practices and offering opportunities for multigenerational community building, the Nest LA Greenspace will empower and support residents in preserving the past and building healthy, meaningful futures.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Plant cultivation for mental and physical health is often seen as a resilience factor among indigenous communities around the world. Providing a space for the city's immigrants to engage in this practice will facilitate healing and community empowerment and support a holistic approach to wellbeing. In the short term, the Nest LA Greenspace will provide a natural sanctuary for RCC program participants who have waited for an opportunity to cultivate stored seeds, as well as an outdoor haven for play. In the long term, the project will serve as a model for inclusive greenspace development that preserves community cultural wealth and deepens Los Angeles' commitment to embracing immigrants and refugees with cultural sensitivity. We look forward to applying this model to future design projects in order to create a Los Angeles that reflects the richness and beauty of its residents' cultures and celebrates immigrants' histories alongside their newly developing identities as Angelenos."

We'll expand our participation in the annual Museums of the Arroyo Day (running for 33 years) to feature SSP artists and their drop-in wooden suncatcher workshops for kids. In spring 2024, we'll offer two drop-in program days that coincide with spring break and Children's Book Week. The culmination of our pilot year will be 2, week-long summer camps in June for children ages 9-12. One week of camp will focus on architectural modeling, and one will focus on furniture models. Both will utilize the house as a primary source for learning and inspiration.

The house is positioned to serve as a gathering place to pursue artistic and educational passions. Side Street Projects' (SSP) mobile studios provide an entry point for young people to access modern tools to flex their creative muscles, learn the craft of woodworking and develop skills in a curriculum that is decreasing in PUSD's schools. We want the GH to serve as a source of inspiration for our youth. Our location provides an environment where SSP's artists and GH staff can create unique experiences for underserved families.

The percentage of Black employees at major tech companies remains low: 2.9% at Salesforce, 3.8% at Facebook, and 4.5% at Microsoft. These disparities begin with major barriers that exist for students of color to gain access to tech careers: o high-poverty schools with 12x less computer science courses than low-poverty schools. o cost-prohibitive access to coding camps with average cost of $13K. The result: only a small percentage of Black [9%] and Latinx [10%] students earn degrees in tech fields, and tech employees of color make up a small fraction of the workforce [Black-7% and Latinx-8%].

Our project will seek out the stories of these groups and display them in stunning murals on huge walls for all to see.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The 'Untold Stories of the Harbor' murals will spotlight historically marginalized and underrepresented communities. These conversations ranging from the invasion, enslavement, and genocide of the native Tongva tribes after the Spanish colonization, the 1923 strike of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) which led to 90 ships being immobilized in San Pedro, the end of \"Fish Harbor\" on Terminal Island in San Pedro, CA after Roosevelt signed an Executive Order for the removal of all Japanese-Americans from the West Coast, and the Watts Towers, an iconic historical landmark that has been often underrepresented. These towers were built and constructed by Italian immigrant, Sabato Rodia from 1886 to 1965. The sculptures were created with steel rebar, concrete, and decorated with intricate mosaic tiles, which have become an artistic theme around the Harbor Area.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The essence of skateboarding is about community, inclusivity and equality. Since skateboarding has a relatively low price point for entry in to the sport, it has grown quickly among youth of varying means. As a result, the skateboarding community is known to be a diverse, welcoming and empowering sport for young people. Unfortunately, due to the male dominated nature of the sport, this has been true almost exclusively for men and boys. Sex-discrimination and harassment is rampant. Women, people who identify as women, and girls face challenges creating safe and welcoming spaces for themselves in skateparks and other public \"skate friendly\" places. For adaptive skaters, the barriers they face are lamentably even higher and more difficult to overcome. The Posieden Foundation has been directly addressing the needs of female able and adaptive skaters by advocating for equal access and providing a platform to increase their visibility.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Poseiden Foundation's Ladies Day takes place annually in Downtown Los Angeles. Held at the World Famous skate complex The Berrics, Ladies Day gives Women, Girls and persons who identify as female, the opportunity to take over the facility and create a safe, encouraging and fun environment for women to skate. This year we are building on our initiative to uplift adaptive female skaters to give skateboarders with health conditions or physical challenges a platform to demonstrate their talents to the world. Our programing includes skateboarding sessions where peers get to skate together and skate clinics that teach skateboarding techniques. We will also have a variety of workshops that develop leadership skills, give access to tailored coaching and support, facilitate networking and bonding among participants, teach self-defense, and promote other well-being workshops such as healing through art, mindful practices and other skills to support healthy living. At Ladies Day we also acknowledge the acute crisis unhoused people are experiencing in Downtown LA by holding a fundraiser to donate food and supplies. This year our goal is to also connect unhoused people to resources and get the community involved in advocating for the issue.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Rising together for a new economy will require the community to come together and grapple with some facts, realities, and questions. The initial stages of this project is to work with the local community to create a community needs assessment and a common narrative about what the community needs in order to progress economically. We are specifically focusing on Eastern San Gabriel Valley and Pomona. Cities such as El Monte, La Puente, Azusa, and Pomona have limited resources in comparison to other larger cities with more resources. Usually community members here struggle on their own for a while and rely on their personal networks of support to find work or support when needed. In addition, there is a significant number of community members who are impacted by their immigration status, which has many repercussions and makes a workers vulnerable to accept work even if it is underpaid, because that is what is available. The projects aims to create at least one worker owned coop that contracts with local anchor institutions for services/goods. The coop members will have a livable wage, health benefits, and benefits that support overall wellbeing. The anchor institutions will be part of a local anchor collaborative where they commit to make every effort to procure goods locally and to support local businesses and coops. This is a community driven project to support and uplift the local economies and encourage investment and active participation in transforming the economy.",

One of the places where we want to create an impact is in creating employment opportunities for youth. Young people tend to work in the service sectors and are more likely to have multiple jobs to supplement their incomes. There are significant disparities between youth who live with parents/family vs. youth who live on their own. Success will be based on the number of community members engaged in this project at various points, from participation in the community needs assessment to choosing to become part of the coop. Another indicator of success is workers being able to earn more money and also save for at least $500.00 for an emergency. In addition, we will generate 3 lists of community driven solutions for each city to address some of the challenges in labor sectors.",

We want to really take a deep dive on issues of income inequality, pay transparency, compensation, and work culture. We believe that in order for a new economy to emerge and one in which people have the opportunity to live well, it's going to take collaboration and a lot of work and research. We also want to encourage local institutions- school districts, hospitals, universities, and city government to make a commitment to support the local economy and utilize their purchasing power to hire.local workers and to procure locally as well. We want to create campaigns where also community members recognize the importance of shopping locally.",

It also is a county of great disparities and inequality. Poverty and wealth exist side by side. This project aims to bring some solutions to the immense poverty we are experiencing and witnessing in the county. Living in this county with a minimum wage or slightly higher is not realistic or sustainable. This project aims are looking for solutions to the economic crisis we are currently facing that is exacerbated by the rising cost of housing, basic necesstties such as utilities, food, and transportation. As a result of this project we can predict that Los Angeles county will have a new and scalable model to transition lower wage earners into better and higher paid jobs that not only support the local economies, it also provides a different framework for the workplace."

AOL's staff have years of experience working immigrants who have survived not only persecution in their countries of origin but who have lived through the brutality and injustice of the United States immigration system. Specifically, refugees and asylum seekers new to the United States face significant obstacles as they seek employment. Many immigrants in removal proceedings or with pending applications wait months for work authorization and have little to no ability to earn an income. Even immigrants who have recently obtained legal status face barriers to steady, just employment that pays them fair wages, full benefits, and provides work-life balance due to language barriers, racism, cultural differences, etc. Therefore, AOL strives to hire employees from the communities we serve and provide competitive salaries, robust benefits, and work-life balance.",

We represent immigrant youth in Special Immigrant Juvenile Status requests as well as Asylum applications. AOL also works closely with its network of social, linguistic, and community support resources, such as schools and county agencies to domestic violence and homeless shelters, to identify clients in need of representation in affirmative asylum applications and welcome the most vulnerable asylum-seekers to Los Angeles County.

Our Administrative Assistant acts as the eyes and ears of the daily workflow. They keep track of all cases, from beginning to end, ensuring that we are meeting goals, staying in constant communication with our clients, and making sure that nothing falls through the cracks in our cases.

Our efforts to hire staff who are members of the communities we serve give us an advantage in engaging with community stakeholders. Hiring directly impacted staff to work at our Los Angeles office also provides us with a decentralized, organic means of engaging with the Los Angeles community rather than developing new connections as outsiders. In this way, our clients are also our community, so their families and their wider network are our key stakeholders. In serving them and staying in touch via our holistic representation model, we continuously educate the Los Angeles community we serve about our program and ensure that Los Angeles is a place where everyone can thrive and have access to opportunities to do so."

MHAS also leads several medical-legal partnerships (MLPs) to reach underserved, high-risk groups (e.g., transition-age youth and pregnant women/new mothers). Our housing justice work also entails community advocacy. MHAS advocates for housing rights and trains community partners to understand the complexities of mental illness and related challenges to meeting essential needs and to interact effectively with those who are extremely hesitant to contact organizations with whom they have no prior relationship or basis for trust.

Legal remedies empower clients to obtain/maintain gainful employment, achieve greater financial stability, and meet essential needs.

To determine how successful our efforts are, we monitor client demographics, types of cases, legal outcomes, immediate financial impact, and client-provided information regarding immediate and long-term effects of services. For housing justice/homelessness prevention services, we assess how many direct housing cases we handle each year (e.g., tenant-landlord disputes or habitability) and how many cases we manage annually that indirectly impact housing stability (e.g., employment or benefits assistance).

In addition to income barriers, many individuals with mental health disabilities lack beneficial social support systems, experience cumulative trauma from justice or child welfare system involvement or from long-term instability, are unaware of their housing rights, and have difficulties obtaining/maintaining stable employment. Their experiences create complex, interrelated housing challenges: mental health instability affects employment; employment affects housing and health care access; inadequate housing and health care access generates increased instability. High-risk populations (e.g., transition-age youth and older adults) with mental health disabilities experience even higher rates of homelessness and housing insecurity."

Upon aging out, one out of every five local foster youth becomes instantly homeless. Within 18 months, more than 50% of aged-out youth will be homeless or incarcerated.

Born in 2020, the Rapid Response program is designed to help this historically underserved demographic plagued by these challenges by providing them with emotional support, stable housing, utility assistance, tuition relief, and other crucial basic need resources for lifelong success. Rapid Response targets aged-out foster youth between the ages of 17 and 26 who live in LA County and meet the predetermined criteria for support. BIPOC continue to be overrepresented in the child welfare system. In LA County specifically, approximately 64% of participants are youth of color, 70% identify as female/non-binary, and 70% are student parents fighting against the cyclical nature of the child welfare system. The following are the focus areas of the Rapid Response program: Imminent housing loss, emergency food resources, technology access, academic assistance, travel/relocation, and other individual needs. To implement this program, Foster Love has partnered with dozens of campus-based foster youth programs, allied non-profit organizations, and foster care agencies in LA County. These entities all go through the same process to become referring partners for the Rapid Response program, streamlining an at-risk youth's access to critical support.",

The number of homeless transition-age youth in LA County has increased by 4% since 2020. This figure has been steadily increasing due to the persistent housing crisis, inflation, defunded community programs, and lack of consistent support for systems-impacted youth. By increasing our capacity to serve at-risk transition-age youth in LA County, Foster Love's Rapid Response program will break the cycle of homelessness and systemic recidivism for current and future populations. By meeting the basic needs of at-risk transition-age youth, we ensure their stability and well-being.

GVN is composed of three main phases: - a five-week long intensive summer filmmaking training serving 20 new youth each year - a premiere public screening in the fall - a year-round program open to all past alumni (serving about 90 youth currently, and growing with every new cohort) to support their development",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "GVN sets out to: - empower the next generation of changemakers and filmmakers - build pathways for underrepresented voices to access the film industry - create content with strong educational values for all ages. Our vision for success is for GVN to increase gender parity, equity, and equality in the film industry and society as a whole. Even if not all participants will pursue a career in the film industry, we have designed GVN to empower all of them to feel confident voicing opinions and having a sense of control over their lives. But for the participants who do embrace a creative career, GVN offers continued filmmaking education opportunities and professional support so that they can actually access this industry and create change from within. As a result, communities who have been historically marginalized will get to see their specific stories and needs more accurately represented and understood locally.",

    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "This isn't a collaborative proposal but we do rely on a few key partners to successfully implement GVN: Mount Saint Mary's University (Doheny campus), Adobe, SmartSource. In addition, Girls' Voices Now films are distributed by our two partners Here TV media (since December 2019) and Kanopy (since February 2021). Since then, our films have already been seen by 1,560,000+ online viewers (mostly located in the United States, New York, Los Angeles, Houston) and we won a Daytime Emmy with HereTV in July 2021 for one of our films. These partnerships are key to amplifying the stories and topics that our participants have chosen to focus on in hopes of contributing to positive social change. All films remain available on our website (https://www.womensvoicesnow.org/girlsvoices-now/).",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "East LA",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Women and girls' voices and stories have been systematically overlooked. Yet, in California today, about one third of women have experienced physical violence inflicted on them by an intimate or former partner. Domestic violence accounts for roughly 20% of all violent crimes. Women still face pay gaps and higher poverty rates, and remain primarily responsible for childcare and housework even when working full-time. Simultaneously, girls between ages 8-14 experience a 30% confidence drop when they reach puberty, in spite outperforming boys academically (YPulse, The Confidence Code for Girls). The confidence gender gap that begins at puberty often remains throughout adulthood, and can seriously impede girls' sense of agency. Girls growing up in under-resourced communities face additional, intersectional discriminations based on ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, immigration status etc. Yet, their stories rarely make it to the screen and they lack access to the film industry.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our thorough evaluation strategy was reviewed by the Executive Vice President of the Center for Nonprofit Management. We collect extensive feedback from participants right before and after the program and then yearly. We track their filmmaking skills acquisition, self-confidence, short and long-term academic and professional goals to name a few key metrics. Across previous cohorts, 24% of participants reported feeling self-confident before taking part in the program vs 94% after. Likewise, 31% of participants felt confident in their ability to reach goals that they have set for themselves vs 75% afterwards. Our alumnae have gone to UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSB, Columbia University and have worked/interned at Netflix, ACLU, Planned Parenthood and PBS to name a few. Thanks to partnerships with HereTV and Kanopy, GVN films have been watched by over 1.5 million online viewers, and in 2021 we won a Daytime Emmy! GVN films have been selected to over 115 film festivals."

Other programs solely focus on outcomes- employment and housing- rather than the underlying issues that prevent many of these young people from finding stability and positive long term change. Our trauma-informed approach uses cognitive, somatic, and nature-based practices to help individuals regulate their nervous system and build greater resiliency. Gardening becomes the center and the physical touch point for our classes. Research indicates that not only does touching earth and caring for a plant offer deep energetic healing on its own, but gardening also allows for a slowing down and pausing that is often skipped once these young people are in the \"real world\" and forced into the rush during their transition of getting out of prison and back to community. For the upcoming year, we have five more interested sites at organizations that support system-impacted, gang impacted, and unhoused young people. Each site we partner with provides land or space to create garden beds or greenspaces; we provide the resources, gardening supplies and curriculum. Additionally, we are developing a Training the Trainer program that will lead to job opportunities for our young people and a creation of additional revenue streams for the organization.",

The opportunity for change now comes to LA County and its communities. In addition, food justice and access to healthy food is an ongoing, integral issue for many in LA County that not only impacts individual health and wellbeing but also the sustainability of our marginalized communities and their opportunity to thrive. Food justice is racial justice. We recognize that the roots of disproportionate harm comes from socialized behaviors, racial disparities from the justice system, a disparate educational system, trauma and generational poverty. With a rising increase in mental health issues in the past two years we believe this program is needed now, particularly as the County wrestles with a new approach to working with these youth.",

We want to see the County move away from a blame and punitive based system to one that seeks to repair the individual, the collective and structural norms that led to harm. We envision this leading to a recreation of what the justice system looks like for youth and young adults in our region. Instead of removing and shunning people from the community where they've caused harm we aim to bring them back into connection and belonging to the land and the self. To aid in this, we seek to support young people harmed by systemic injustice, structural racism and a societal disconnection by re-learning the importance of care, compassion, and connecting them to income opportunities for long-term stability.",

When children begin in Pre-K, they have not yet encountered fear or failure. They gain self-confidence and, from there, build STEMM identities. Why does one youth call SSA II the \"best place to work on math\"? It supplies two elements lacking in school: real-world context and peer support. From a pool of 25 university students, mostly SSA II alumni, come the academically successful and goal-oriented instructors. They look like their students and have similar lived experience. Guided by them, each grade level undertakes distinct hands-on experiments - like extracting DNA from a banana - and studies a different profession. Students sign up for tutoring slots, led by these instructors, to review difficult homework from school. Field trips - most recently to Amgen - extend the learning.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The Formerly incarcerated face many challenges when reintegrating into society. These challenges include cultural adaptation, as they may struggle to adjust to societal changes that occurred during their time in prison. The unfamiliarity with technology, evolving social norms, and changes in communication can create barriers to their successful reentry. Employment is also a challenge for these individuals. The stigma associated with criminal records often leads to limited job opportunities and discrimination in the hiring process. Communication and emotional well-being are critical aspects of successful reentry and formerly incarcerated individuals face difficulties in expressing their frustrations, fears, and concerns. Lastly, Resisting negative influences is hard. The presence of negative peer influences, the temptation to engage in criminal activities, and the lack of positive role models can lead to recidivism and hinder their efforts to reintegrate into society successfully.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Navigating Life program is distinct in its approach as it is run by formerly incarcerated mentors who draw from their own personal experiences to guide and support individuals transitioning back into society. These mentors serve as role models who have successfully overcome the challenges of reentry and are uniquely positioned to understand the barriers and navigate around them. The program pairs newly released individuals with these mentors who provide firsthand guidance throughout the reentry process. The mentors have firsthand knowledge of the struggles faced by individuals coming out of incarceration, and they leverage their personal experiences to provide practical advice, emotional support, and motivation to help participants achieve a successful reentry. By having mentors who have walked the same path, the Navigating Life program creates a sense of trust and understanding that fosters strong connections between mentors and participants. These mentors serve as mentors and guides, offering insights, sharing strategies, and providing a compassionate ear to listen to the concerns and frustrations of those transitioning back into society. Overall, the Navigating Life program, led by formerly incarcerated mentors, offers a unique and powerful approach to supporting individuals during the reentry process. By sharing their experiences, these mentors empower participants, build resilience, and create a path to a successful reintegration into society.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If the Navigating Life Program in Los Angeles County is successful, it will bring about a significant transformation with far-reaching impact. One of the most notable changes will be a reduction in violence and crime within the community. By effectively addressing the challenges of reentry, the program will empower formerly incarcerated individuals to reintegrate successfully and lead law-abiding lives, breaking the cycle of violence and reducing recidivism rates. The program's focus on cultural adaptation will foster a more inclusive and harmonious community. This will contribute to a decrease in social tensions and conflicts, promoting a safer and more cohesive environment for all residents. The program will result in reduced violence and crime, foster an harmonious environment, increase economic opportunities, and promote healthier relationships. The program will contribute to a safer, more peaceful, and prosperous county for all residents.",

Despite the growth of our local tech ecosystem and L.A.'s increasingly diverse population, the current workforce does not represent this diversity. Local tech companies continue to recruit from top universities and outsource talent, reinforcing systemic barriers for women, people of color and opportunity for youth to access this growing labor market which can increase their income by 2M in their lifetime (Measure of America).",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "From 2023-2024, LA-Tech.org is prepared to double the scale of our Academies work and place 300 post secondary students in the LA region from low-income and marginalized communities into tech careers. We not only want to increase the number of students that we place in internships, but also increase our internship and job post Academy placement percentage from 45% to 60%. We will do this by building out a more robust IT Accelerator model which will take Academy scholars into an IT internship with the County through the Internal Services Department (ISD), resulting in a one-year apprenticeship-like experience before job placement and degree completion in IT.

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "East LA",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Belvedere Lake has been used as a place for the local community to fish for years. With the addition of two FTWs AquaBio believes the positive impact will be multi-faceted. FTWs have the capability of maintaining healthy fish communities by providing fish habitat and improving water quality. This will enhance fish community productivity, therefore, having the potential to alleviate the financial burden of LA County to restock the lake as frequently as in the past. In addition, boosted fish stocks should encourage more frequent use of the lake. Spending more time in green open spaces and engaging in the sport of fishing will improve both mental and physical health to local fishers. As well as bringing families and friends together, and creating lasting memories among the community. Information and data gathered as part of the project will show success and therefore, locations in other parts of LA County may benefit from the installation of FTWs.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "As a new proposed project, AquaBio proposes to monitor the following before, during and after the project: Social Impact: Through simple 3-5 question surveys to the fishing clubs, boy scouts and while conducting lake maintenance we will garner information on approximate numbers of: -How many visitors to the lake? -How many fishers? -How many of those fishers are fishing for food and/or fishing to catch and release? Environmental Impact: 3 water quality sampling events will be conducted on ten different water quality parameters (Temperature, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Nitrate, Ammonia, Phosphate, Depth (Secchi Disk), Biological & Chemical Oxygen Demand & Fecal Coliform). Fish Community Impact: How many times before the project is the lake restocked compared to after. This will demonstrate the FTW impact on numbers of visitors and fishers due to an improvement in water quality, increase in fish community productivity, and number of fish caught for food or recreation (catch & release).",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "We are working with LA County ISD Department and Belvedere Lake staff for approval and access to lake for this project. They have granted approval and hope to receive the floating treatment wetland islands. It would make the lake more beautiful and attractive to those that frequent there with native plants, clearer water and more fish. Additionally, crime has been studied to decrease in greener areas. The lake has had a history or crime and the parks managers agree that more nature would go far to deter potential crime. Safety is their number one concern around the lake.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "AquaBio will be responsible for the planting, installation, and launching of 1x350 sqft. and 1x200 sqft Floating Treatment Wetland (FTW). FTWs are islands of buoyant artificial mats containing native plants including a native Sycamore tree. They are planted with special planting media, native riparian and/or wetland plants and launched onto a water body. The plants are allowed to grow naturally, and as they develop, their roots grow through the matrix and into the water below. They are an excellent example of biomimicry, using nature's processes and systems to tackle environmental issues, such as poor water quality, helping to reduce excess nutrients, suspended solids, heavy metals, and other pollutants. These islands will: -improve water quality, acting as biofilters to uptake pollutants, including nutrients, and some heavy metals. -provide habitat and shade for fish. -enhance nursery habitat for fish. -ultimately provide and maintain access to a healthy protein food source to underserved community members. During the proposed project timeline AquaBio will perform water quality testing to assess treatment effectiveness in the lake. In addition, a survey of Park visitors will be conducted to gain a better understanding of how many visitors use the lake to fish, the number of species caught, as well as how many benefit i.e. number of families involved in fishing and consuming the fish. AquaBio will also install educational signage explaining the project in detail.",

We believe if we can shrink the funnel of people going in to homelessness and open up the back end of people coming out then we can make a measurable and sustainable difference. This is our fifth year and we have established organizations like the Milken Institute helping us. We want to help Mayor Bass move 17,000 Los Angelenos off the streets in 2023- 2024. The challenge is we're facing a countywide shortage of approximately 500,000 units of affordable housing.",

We are proud to be the only organization in Long Beach to serve hot meals 7-days-a-week. Since 2022, COA has been collaborating with Healthcare in Action to provide street outreach to homeless individuals in Long Beach. COA provides meals, hygiene kits with masks, sanitizer, and other hygiene products. Food Bank - Five days a week, COA operates a food bank. COA reaches an estimated 9,000 individuals through this program. COA offers a farmer's market-style service where families can pick the foods they want to take home. Families bring their own bags and fill them with the foods they most need. Since many families struggle to purchase food for their pets, COA provides pet food as well. Being able to provide food for their loved ones is a vital step in feeling empowered to take control of all other aspects of one's life. COA operates a Diaper Bank on Fridays for up to 200 families every week. COA distributes baby food as part of the diaper program. Many mothers in need are forced to choose between purchasing diapers and providing food and shelter for their families. With this program, COA attempts to address the lack of diapers, which has been linked to maternal depression. Other programs include Senior Days, Clothing Bank, and Community Events.",

Many homeless and low-income individuals struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic. Children under 18 were 8% of the count, and seniors over 62 were 13%. Women comprised 30% of the homeless population. People of color were the largest racial/ethnic group identified in the count. These statistics demonstrate that people of color, women, children and seniors are most affected by inflation, unemployment and a severe lack of affordable housing in Long Beach. The Long Beach Unified School District is home to over 3,000 unhoused students, three times the average national homeless student population. 100% of those COA serves are low-income. 80% identify as persons of color.",

Programs are geared toward keeping at-risk families intact, working and independent in order to avoid becoming homeless, improving the quality of life for low-income families to give them hope and strength and helping homeless people regain their independence, permanent housing and self-sufficiency and ultimately meet their immediate needs. Low-income families rely on COA for hot meals and food, which allows them to redirect their income to pay for rent, transportation and other living expenses. By increasing food security, the likelihood of homelessness is considerably reduced. With access to healthy food, children will be less likely to develop health conditions such as anemia or obesity. Seniors will benefit from COA's food programs by not having to choose between needed healthcare and food, reducing their chances of experiencing poor nutrition, housing instability and social isolation.",

Cash transfers that provide regular, stable income support will be a critical supplement to existing benefits for many families. However, for some families, participating in a cash transfer pilot is not worth the risk. Constantly maintaining eligibility for existing (yet inadequate) benefits is dehumanizing and creates fear of benefits loss.

We also hope that larger financial institutions like traditional banks and Community Development Financial Institutions will consider Cultivate a scalable model for supporting young adult entrepreneurs.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Entrepreneurship is a courageous, challenging, and often necessary endeavor. But too often, entrepreneurs from underserved and underrepresented communities face barriers to accessing the capital (loans, investments, grants) and support they need to start and grow small businesses. Nearly 40% of Inclusive Action constituents have been denied a loan from a mainstream lender at least once. In many cases, entrepreneurs must turn to high-interest loans or other harmful lenders; one in three people Inclusive Action serves has taken at least one predatory loan in the past. For young adult entrepreneurs, these challenges are made worse by other barriers like being considered \"unbankable,\" having limited or no credit history, and lacking the support systems they need. The specific population of young adults Inclusive Action serves also faces challenges resulting from their gender preferences, involvement in juvenile justice or foster systems, lack of stable housing, or immigration status.",

Since launching its micro-finance programs in 2016, Inclusive Action has refined its lending and business coaching approach to better support low-income communities. This is why Inclusive Action pairs every loan with tailored business coaching and support and provides these services through a \"whole-person\" lens. This is the framework through which we created Cultivate. Cultivate supports participants in the following ways: - Loan Capital and \"Supportive\" Capital - Ultra Low-Interest loans help young entrepreneurs invest in their businesses and build their credit, while small business grants and participation stipends help students complete their training and jumpstart their businesses; - Cohort-based Entrepreneurship Training and 1:1 Business Coaching - 10-12 cohort workshops and tailored coaching help entrepreneurs build business, financial, and wellness skills and develop their business ideas and goals; - Mentorship and peer-to-peer support - Entrepreneurs learn from each other and are connected to more experienced entrepreneurs in their specific industry; - Wrap-around support - Inclusive Action works with local youth-serving organizations to provide wrap-around support to help meet a variety of needs.",

Through the use of cognitive behavioral concepts, we equip directly-impacted participants with tools and strategies to understand their decision-making and thought processes. When an individual becomes aware of the triggers and emotions that influence their actions, they are able to employ self-assessment and intervention strategies to modify their behavior. It is our goal for participants to realize their purpose and potential through exposure to resources and success strategies that include knowing their rights, understanding laws and judicial systems, exploring career opportunities, and setting goals. The curriculum consists of four phases: Awareness, Intervention, Rights, and Tools. Workshop topics include, but are not limited to, Trauma-Informed: Why Hurt People Hurt People, Self-Awareness & Leadership, Gang & Street Violence, Drugs & Alcohol, Mass Incarceration: Criminal Law & Procedure, War on Immigrants: Crimmigration & Mass Deportations, Pathways to Education, Pathways to Career Readiness, and Financial Literacy.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The Epiphany Project is an entrypoint for individuals reentering their communities after incarceration. Graduates of the program become a part of our criminalized immigrant support network as active community members and justice advocates. One key element of the Epiphany Project is that we subsidize the cost of tattoo removal services for participants. While removing their tattoos, we provide job readiness training to help clients research vocational trades, resume building and mock interviews. Upon program completion, clients are given employment opportunities in places where previously marginalized, and most importantly, a clean slate and a second chance to succeed in our communities. With our extensive reentry services, LA County will see a reduction in recidivism in jails and juvenile halls, reducing violence and crime by successully graduating and removing the tattoos of 75% of our clients.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Community safety and violence prevention is at the core of our mission and programming. Homies Unidos serve immigrant communities through violence prevention and intervention initiatives, existing at the intersection of the fights for criminal justice reform and immigrant rights advocacy - a field of advocacy now identified as Crimmigration. Since its founding in 1998, we have served over 18,000 youth and adults through lifestyle recovery, tattoo removal, leadership development, and emergency support services to formerly incarcerated individuals and their families. Our violence reduction and gang intervention strategy includes the implementation of culturally relevant programming and prioritizing service to recent immigrants who have fled violence in Central America. By identifying and addressing the needs of formerly-incarcerated youth and adults, we are able to uplift and empower those at the margins of society to become leaders in their communities and agents of social change.",

Our data sources include sign-in sheets, client intake files and our protocols include confidentiality and HIPAA guidelines. We recently developed a database to include case management tracking, staff notes, and reporting. The electronic database provides us with improved data tracking mechanisms of number of clients served, services provided, program completion, case management needs and referras made. By accurately tracking clients served, case management, and program participation we ensure our community is being successfully served."

In the long-term, to achieve our mission, we need to move into real \"systems change\" work. Formalizing partnerships with higher education institutions is key in effecting systems change. In LA County, our aspiration would be to develop a formalized partnership with a higher education institution to better support the college-to-career transition for its first-generation and low-income college graduates. By proving the effectiveness of these partnerships, we can demonstrate the impact of COOP's promising alumni-powered model and intervention.

People who are underemployed earn $10k less per year than folks who are appropriately employed. Unsurprisingly, there are significant differences by race. The uneven distribution of underemployment helps explain how college fails to close the income gap or secure Black (& Hispanic) wealth. Informal relationships also dominate our labor market. At least a third of U.S. workers secured their current job through a referral, and some put that figure as high as 70-85%. According to LinkedIn, applicants with an employee referral are 9 times more likely to be hired. Underemployed grads have the skills and drive to succeed, but they don't have someone to pull them into a meaningful career. Even in the digital economy, a bachelor's degree is not enough. We need social capital-connections, casual favors, timely referrals-as much as we need skills.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "To overcome underemployment we need to emphatically and intentionally facilitate peer connections. COOP matches peer cohorts of underemployed college grads with near-peer alumni coaches to support them in building the professional skills and networks they need to get their first good job after graduation. For 16 weeks (200 hours) peer cohorts of 16 motivated grads meet nightly to learn technical skills, meet potential employers, and build community to jump start upwardly mobile careers. The curriculum introduces participants to the hard skills (e.g., SEO, Tableau, Salesforce) and soft skills (e.g., time management, communication) of each industry and provides guidance and support as they search for that good first job. Four near-peer alumni lead each cohort, teaching the curriculum and serving as mentors and guides. Our alumni captains are backed by a social work team that provides wraparound support. Our Partnerships team connects COOPers to full-time upwardly mobile careers by building meaningful relationships with employers. We established our LA site in 2020 and since then have grown our local alumni community to over 300 strong. With this proposal, we seek to further extend our LA growth, connecting more un-/underemployed college graduates to meaningful careers and propelling them onto a path of economic mobility.

For young learners, increased motivation and attention span are prerequisites for academic success; it is therefore our belief that UPLIFT will lead to significant improvement in literacy goals. Our success is also measured by educator participation: we administer surveys which track teachers' comfort leading arts activities, frequency with which they integrate arts, ability to integrate social-emotional learning, and student engagement levels.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "UPLIFT will be a program aimed at increasing literacy in Universal Prekindergarten classes through inclusive arts integration. Our approach is ideally suited to this population, particularly in the Preschool for All Learners program - children 3 to 5 years of age who have been identified with federal and/or state defined special education eligibility. Our highly-specialized team of teaching artists with early-childhood-education backgrounds will create a sequential unit that uses music, theater, movement, and visual arts activities to teach basic literacy skills. The activities will be student-centered and interactive; rather than relying on cookie-cutter worksheets and instructional videos, they will unfold as a series of play-based arts strategies encouraging student leadership, creativity, and collaboration. We are confident that the inclusive and responsive nature of our approach will provide a developmentally appropriate and engaging course of study. Once the curriculum is complete, we will begin a pilot program to evaluate its effectiveness in a local public school - our current partners include Los Angeles Unified School District, Pasadena USD, Torrance USD, Paramount USD, and Lynwood USD. We will engage with administrators and stakeholders to determine the ideal site, as well as enlist an independent research team to study its impact - we have existing relationships with Loyola Marymount University and UCLA, and are eager to engage with an evaluator for this project.",

Students with such arts-education access and literacy skills are supported in graduating from high school and are able to bring their full lived experiences and contribute to society in ways we can only dream of. In the first year, we aim to create an inclusive, effective, and scaffolded curriculum that leads to a statistically significant increase in literacy skills for our students. To scale the program, we will then incorporate feedback from all stakeholders, including student participants, teachers, administrators, and evaluators and use our culturally responsive and holistic approach to adjust the curriculum in order to best serve LA County moving forward.",

This means that \"by 2025-26, regardless of background, race, zip code, immigration status, or income level, every child will have access to TK as a quality learning experience the year before Kindergarten.\" Many schools who have previously only served children aged 5 and up will now need to create new classes, hire new staff, and design developmentally appropriate programming for 4-year-olds, a group with unique learning needs both academically and socially. It is imperative that these classes prepare students for a lifetime of learning by emphasizing literacy skills, as reading correlates to emotional intelligence, social skills, self-esteem, higher future earning potential, and housing security, among others."

Research shows 2/3 of LA County's Black & Latino populations live in areas with disproportionately less greenspace. Central LA is a severely disadvantaged park area (LA County Park Needs Assessment), which is a result of redlining, inequitable planning, and systemic racism, with gated communities overshadowing barren areas. As a consequence, our community is deprived of the benefits that greenspace provides, including mitigating the heat island effect, mental-wellbeing & lack of outdoor spaces. Our community stated lack of parks leads to less neighborhood cohesion and isolation, as parks are important gathering spaces. Despite efforts by Teapot to secure land for a neighborhood garden, rapid gentrification and high costs of land acquisition have posed challenges. As no accessible land remains, the only viable option is to transform private yards into community gardens.",

Mental Health is a big concern, and our initiative aims to foster a sense of belonging and support. Our art events will have a home in these gardens, offering a unique educational environment. By enabling families to rent their spaces, we can foster economic equality. Providing access to fresh food while promoting healthier lifestyles. In the long term, we envision greenspace access as the ultimate form of equity. Scaling our model, we plan to create a map of these gardens throughout LA. Our ultimate goal is to create a public botanical garden, a cultural arena for artists, funded by the city but cultivated by the people.

This began our City Sprouts program where we bridged access to gardens around LA and hired local artists to lead workshops. Utilizing Healing Gardens, an online platform, we've been able to host tea tastings and events to generate revenue, proving a high demand for our space. Our surveys show that garden events decrease anxiety and families can connect with one another. Further, families found our open-air programs to reduce anxiety and be beneficial to their mental health. Another measurable impact is the microclimate in the garden, which is approximately 8 degrees cooler than the surrounding area due to plants and shade structures.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "To address the lack of green space access, Teapot Gardens will build three public paradise gardens for low-income BIPOC homeowners in the park-deprived neighborhoods of Central LA. Paradise gardens are designed to promote mental well-being and foster community. A combination of beauty and function uniquely suited for California's changing climate, creating shade, food, and refuge from the heat. The construction phase will engage locals with hands-on workshops, sharing the traditions of building paradise gardens. Co-creating spaces cultivate a village-like atmosphere within the city. Once established, the gardens will be activated with bi-monthly art programs led by local emerging artists, providing opportunities for career growth and community engagement. Accessible to nearby residents for free, and available to rent for gatherings, generating income for homeowners. This project provides timely access to resources for a community that would otherwise be displaced before a traditional park could be established. We recognize the importance of reaching these individuals now, fostering their growth and well-being through experiences centered around creation over consumption. Our approach offers an immediate solution to greenspace access by bypassing bureaucratic hurdles and lengthy timelines with park development. By building autonomous communities that support and rely on each other, we cultivate civic leadership, empowering residents to voice their needs and find solutions."

Meanwhile, the pandemic and inflation have exacerbated housing insecurity, with growing rental debt and household costs. With COVID era renter protections ending, we see that at its root, the housing system is not designed to support the most vulnerable. Cities like Los Angeles have been planned in ways that disinvest in the working poor and people of color, yet eagerly invest when there are opportunities for profit. As the housing crisis threatens to push entire communities out of their neighborhoods, it's imperative to reimagine another way: one that honors local knowledge and culture, restores relationships with one another, and centers those most vulnerable to displacement."

They'll learn what's truly valuable is healthy, nutritious, organic food and that you can't eat diamonds. While there are great programs out there teaching these skills and lessons to kids, they aren't always available or accessible for all kids and bridging this gap is part of our vision for this program. We aim to spark the thought in their minds that this planet is alive and it is our responsibility to keep it that way. We do that by protecting the planet and protecting ourselves. The county will look and feel different as we see the children knowing the importance of what they're putting in their bodies and seeing communities grow together. In learning the value of Mother Earth and that you shouldn't trash the Mother, we aim to have a cleaner city and work towards being one of the healthiest cities in the world.",

It relates to both K-12 STEAM Education and Green Spaces as we need to incorporate both education and creation to bring food security to those locally in the city of Los Angeles. Individuals having to choose between healthy food and other things like clothes shouldn't be the reality we live in. Physical, mental and emotional wellbeing are all heavily impacted by the environments we are in and the food we eat. This problem is affecting everyone, all across the globe, however, our kids are heavily impacted by this as they are growing up in a time where fast food is glorified and healthy food isn't valued. In the United States, individuals in food deserts are an average of 3 miles away from healthy, fresh food. Teaching individuals how to grow, tend to and harvest their own food is not only beneficial for themselves, but also beneficial for the preservation of the planet.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "With this being an early-stage project, we'll define and measure success first and foremost by the smiles on people's faces. We would like to track and measure the health outcomes in the city. We will also define success by the number of families impacted by this program and aim to send follow-ups after both workshops and the virtual modules are taken to gain feedback and learn more about the impact made. We'll know it's been successful, when there is more beauty throughout the city and see a shift in the air quality."

    "organization": "DignityMoves x Gensler",
    "summary": "There are 2 million square feet of publicly-owned parking rooftops (40 structures) in LA County-mostly vacant. Hidden in plain sight, when land is in short supply and construction costs escalating, these bear unexplored potential to be developed as emergency or transitional housing for a burgeoning homeless population. In this pilot, located at East LA Community College, we propose to develop a scalable housing prototype geared toward college-age youth, for whom the cost and availability of housing is the greatest obstacle to a college degree.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The ambition and potential impact of our proposal extends beyond the 100-200 students whose lives and career trajectories the pilot will affect. Our immediate vision of success can be summarized as: a) getting the project built; b) achieving a total (soft and hard) cost of $250K/unit (less than one-third that of current ground-up construction on non-public land); and c) achieving a design-thru-construction schedule of 2 years or less (completion by Dec 2025), versus 5-6 years for most publicly-subsidized supportive housing (DignityMoves uses only private investment capital). Longer term, we expect that if successful on these terms, the pilot will breed a powerful echo effect, instigating others (both developers and public officials) to adopt the same strategy on the roughly 40 other publicly-owned parking rooftops around the County, which hold the potential to accommodate as many as 3,500 beds (@ +/- 600 SF of rooftop per bed) as either emergency, transitional or student housing.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Realization is the most effective means of truly gauging the success of our larger proposal: to address the supportive housing deficit by utilizing the two million SF of publicly-owned parking rooftops County-wide. A pilot project is the truest and best way to actually identify and work through problems--a necessary process that forges the efficacy of the idea--in terms of constructability: speed to market; cost; and the logistics of use and operation. In this respect, success will be defined by how the metrics of each of the above compare against those of comparable housing: i.e. stick-built, ground-up construction on private land, using public subsidies. Measuring the actual impact of the pilot, while equally important, can only be assessed over time, in terms of how quickly and effectively the model we create is adopted by others (public agencies) on similar sites (parking rooftops)--to move the needle from housing 200 (the pilot) to 3,000+ countywide.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Our proposal simultaneously addresses 3 urgent but interrelated problems facing LA. First is the burgeoning homeless population--more specifically those needing emergency housing (high acuity individuals), and those lower acuity individuals in need of transitional housing (1-3 years). The latter group includes college-age students who are housing insecure, who comprise twenty percent of those at community colleges and ten percent of those in the Cal State Univ system. These \"hidden homeless\" often live in cars or sleep on classmates' couches, unable to afford or even find dorm housing. This lack of availability/affordability--the second problem our proposal addresses--has proven the prime obstacle to a college education (more than tuition). Lastly, our proposal and pilot addresses the severe shortage of available land to locate supportive housing of any type, and whose resultant cost and acquisition time negatively impacts the affordability of units as much as that of construction.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Over 46 acres of publicly-owned, vacant parking structure rooftops in LA County lie hidden in plain sight, including many on community college and Cal State campuses. At a time when land is escalating in cost and in short supply, the opportunity exists to utilize these \"found\" sites for emergency or transitional supportive housing. Removed from public view, they possess structural concrete decks capable of carrying one or two stories of additional construction. Besides \"free\" real estate, such rooftops offer existing infrastructure (water and power), reducing the need for costly foundations and underground utilities. We propose to develop a pilot project as proof of this concept, so that once shown to be successful, it will (like the ADU) be adopted by others and brought to scale County-wide. Located on a parking rooftop on the East LA College campus, the site would be developed to provide transitional housing for between 100-200 of the \"hidden\" homeless students who currently make up twenty percent of ELAC's enrollment. If populated with prefabricated modular housing, the speed and cost of such a \"plug-in\" approach would, we estimate, be well below half the current price of $6-700,000 for the same unit if newly built on private land. And because the project is open air, in SoCal's temperate climate, it invites the provision of PV-powered, sheltered outdoor open space for exercise, dining, classes--even lightweight hydroponic agriculture."

While there may be a lack of support services available for low-income community members, there are even less services available for individuals with criminal records. Despite the traumatic, intergenerational, and sometimes fatal impacts of incarceration, many aid programs require system-impacted community members to jump through so many bureaucratic and technological hoops that healing and thriving becomes out of reach. Some programs prohibit system-impacted community members from receiving services altogether. Our community members are often denied employment because of their records and lack of access to job training. Many struggle to keep food on the table, and are one or two paychecks from houselessness. This program can serve as a first step in alleviating the economic and emotional burden of incarceration.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Mutual Aid program creates opportunities for system-impacted individuals and alleviates economic insecurity by offering rental and financial support, which prevents disconnections of utility services and evictions. The program also serves to facilitate the maintenance of household sufficiency through the provision of supply-based resources including food, clothing, and infant and household supplies. It also addresses the need for long-term healing, wellness, and connection by providing referrals to various community groups including leadership development and healing spaces for system-impacted individuals and families, and empowered spaces to learn organizing skills and share one's story. The program prioritizes authentic connection with community members within LA County and upon receiving services, offers connections to coalition and advocacy opportunities that are actively dismantling the oppressive systems that allow the community to be in such dire need in the first place. There are over 1,000 individuals waiting to hear when the Mutual Aid program begins accepting new applications. The program has helped over 2,006 system-impacted households, over 81% of recipients identify as Black and Brown and 90% have been incarcerated.

These follow-up calls allow us to hear how each person was impacted by the support and how they'd like to get more involved in the abolition movement. Many of our Mutual Aid recipients go on to be leaders within this movement and some have even represented our organization in coalition spaces. Measuring the success and impact of this program is rooted in storytelling and membership engagement. Since 2022, 106 community members (and counting!) have asked to be connected to other DPN programs. This huge milestone shows how with a little financial and basic needs support, community members can afford to be more active within their communities and are eager to learn and support one another.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Testimonials from community members show how much the support helped them to keep their phones on, pay for childcare, which all allowed them to keep a job or find a new one. This support has a direct impact on keeping our community from being evicted and being able to buy food for their families. However, $1,000 only goes so far, especially in Los Angeles. This program is only addressing the tip of the iceberg and with this grant, we hope to continue and expand this program. A large part of our system-impacted community still returns home only to be houseless and without the support system, they deserve. Our communities are still over-policed and under-resourced. The goal has always been abolition. Therefore, in order to say this program is a success, we would need to see a city that is based on care rather than cages and where there are enough resources to allow families to thrive. Specifically, we would love to eventually provide housing and more wrap-around support."

This means partnering with AAPI organizations to disperse the book. We expand our initiative by creating lesson plan books, flashcards, and additionally designed interactive activities for children to access and learn Mandarin Chinese in a playful way.

Fast forward 25 years later, she's retiring from her teaching career. Even though teachers notoriously receive little to no budgets to decorate and buy books for their classrooms, my mom found creative ways to contribute to her students by making her own. Today there are 5.4 million Chinese Americans with about 30% living in Los Angeles alone! California's had a long history of Chinese immigrants, yet as immigrants become first generations to multi-generational Americans, there comes a time to balance embracing some levels of their heritage.

Black families are 10% of the population, but represent 25% of the foster care system. 50% of foster care system CA children are in LA. I was able to graduation HS and pursue a BS and post-graduate education. 58%of kids in the foster care system graduate HS, only 8% graduate college versus 46% of kids not in the foster care system. 50% of foster care system kids become homeless or incarcerated.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "SBV offers unique parenting classes, accessible virtually and in person, which are marketed as a tool for families prior to DCFS involvement or removal of a child from a home. We also accept and train parents, as part of the court process, after a child is placed outside the home. We encourage extended families members and community adults to take the course to increase knowledge in the village for at-risk children. Hospitality, child-care and transportation are offered to students in order to assist adults in overcoming logistical barriers to their education. Each class starts with prayer (inclusive of the faiths of the students) and moves to a check-in period. Students are highly encouraged to participate and are called upon. If a student has trouble coping with this style, private office hours are offered once a week where the student may either complete the work with a facilitator or discuss any issues which may be interfering with class participation. Additionally, the course includes lessons on how to combat negative racial messages in media and school groups and to bolster positive examples at home. At the end, each class is organized into its own support group privately and on social media. Students are encouraged to support one another and are encouraged to either talk to a facilitator or come back for a specific class if they need support after their course is already done. The village supports each other long after the initial class is over.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We will measure success by analyzing the outcomes of our students and their families. We are currently collecting data via post-course exams, post-course surveys, informal interviews, and by analyzing participant reviews on social media platforms, such as Facebook. In tracking the families after they graduate, we will determine if the behavior charts, positive incentive charts, and soul/self-care tools have resulted in healthier habits, behaviors and attitudes of the family unit. For Community members who take the course, or go on to become instructors, we determine how many families they impact and if the trained person becomes a valuable source of support and what tools they are using, such as social media. As we train more instructors, we will develop a more efficient approach to evaluate with SBV values that trainer's methods. In the future, we hope to be a big part of the reason for LA having the lowest number of foster children instead of the highest in the country."

This is a problem because the Arts work young brains in a different way from traditional schooling. The Arts help the students be more creative, solve problems, and understand emotions. Interactive Theater Arts engage youth as participants in a staged production. This can provide a profound experiential learning experience that other teaching methods do not offer. Live theatrical performances can cultivate self-esteem and interpersonal and leadership skills. The objective is to use the Arts as a gentle, entertaining, fun, and effective means of having a measurable impact on the growth and development of youth. A Faery Hunt program also carries simple but often forgotten life messages including kindness, forgiveness, respect, ecological responsibility, and tolerance. Theatrical Arts can foster positive ethical and moral elements at an early age.",

A Faery Hunt's emphasis on kindness, forgiveness, respect, ecological responsibility, and tolerance would contribute to creating a more compassionate and inclusive community in Los Angeles County.

Family reunifications can be transformative, but they also can have their limitations: for many individuals experiencing homelessness, family can be part of the problem, not part of the solution. Early on in our work to end relational poverty on the streets, we identified a pressing challenge: how might we help cultivate desperately needed social support systems for those who cannot or will not reconnect with their loved ones? The answer emerged in early 2020, in the early weeks of the pandemic, when we partnered with Sequoia Living to pilot a 1:1 buddy system to connect their previously unhoused senior residents with our trained volunteers. The relationships that formed were breathtaking and helped alleviate crushing isolation and loneliness. These findings were easily translated into our current Miracle Friends program for those experiencing homelessness.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We offer a humane, highly effective way to help end homelessness. The impact of our work is demonstrated in the improved mental health of our participants, more effective resource navigation of existing services, and the ability of our volunteers to engage in an issue they feel passionate about. Currently, in Los Angeles, we are in the midst of a Randomized Control Trial of our programs with USC, in which surveys are administered to our participants experiencing homelessness each quarter for 5 quarters. The results will be released in 2024 and we expect them to confirm our findings from an initial pilot in San Francisco, showing improved mental health for our participants and improved housing status. Currently, the relationships between our volunteers and their friends provide a wealth of data proving that our programs are successful.

For at least 1 in 4 adults experiencing homelessness in the SF Bay Area, the primary event or condition that led to homelessness was the loss or lack of their social support systems (e.g., divorce, separation, breakup). Without adequate social support, periods of housing insecurity last longer. Miracle Friends has matched 300 friendships which reestablishes trust and provides insights and understanding to our neighbors. Those experiencing homelessness are often deeply isolated and stigmatized. As one of our friends stated: \"I never realized I was homeless when I lost my housing, only when I lost my family and friends.\" Our work provides a vital pathway for Los Angeles volunteers seeking to help, partner sites looking to extend valuable services, and those experiencing homelessness.",

It's community.\" - Jim Greene, Director of Boston's Emergency Shelter Commission This grant will allow us to continue our Miracle Friends program in Los Angeles beyond the pilot currently underway. Funding for our pilot ends in early 2024 and we are seeking funds to provide a seamless continuation of existing Miracle Friend connections and to facilitate new life-changing partnerships. Our programs are all co-created with our unhoused neighbors, service partners, and volunteers. Staff members with lived experience help guide the design and growth of our programs, so we can continue to meet people where they are (without leaving them there). Our phone buddy program matches volunteers with individuals experiencing homelessness for weekly phone calls and texts, like AJ (Bahrain) and Jaime (Los Angeles) that have developed a beautiful friendship across the globe. To date, 300+ volunteers have logged 100,000+ minutes. Funds to support our programs in Los Angeles go toward staff, volunteer recruitment, training and support, and client enrollment and support. We also have technology costs associated with logging and reporting our Miracle Friend connections."

Directly impacted community members who have been harmed by punitive legal systems and the immigrant detention system, will learn firsthand how these systems were built by design through the legacy of colonialism and develop skilled organizing skills. Simultaneously, community members who are a part of the leadership training will gain vital access and support their own health and healing via resources to community-driven safety net programs including oRALE's own mutual aid and community care hub which addresses food apartheid in Long Beach and nourishes more than 1,000 families a year."

Children engage in abusive behavior toward animals and others because they have learned that violence and intimidation are appropriate means for interaction, and we know that children who demonstrate bullying behavior are more likely to engage in domestic violence, criminality, and substance abuse later in life.

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Green space is associated with a large number of health benefits, including lower premature mortality, longer life expectancy, fewer mental health problems, less cardiovascular disease, better cognitive functioning in children and the elderly, and healthier babies. It also helps to mitigate air pollution, heat and noise levels, and provides opportunities for physical exercise and social interaction. Poorer neighborhoods tend to have less green space with fewer parks, playgrounds, and recreational facilities compared to wealthier neighborhoods. These communities may also experience a higher population density, limited public transportation options, and a lack of green infrastructure, which can further limit access to green spaces. Children, our future generation, benefit the most from green space yet it is rarely found on most LA County Schools in low- income neighbors. Additionally, children and staff spend the majority of everyday on campus (averaging 9-10 hours per day).",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "A Trust for Public Land analysis found that creating open, nature-filled, parklike settings for every school site would give access to quality green space within a 10-minute walk from home for more than 1 million Angelenos. The Los Angeles Unified School District alone has more than 1,000 schools with approximately 4.8 million people live near these schools. The project will reinvigorate neglected greenery, establish new gardens/tree cover, and provide the structure and training to sustain these green spaces for years to come creating a significant impact on improving the health of community residents surrounding schools. In addition, students will be empowered to create immediate, long lasting change in their schools and communities as they develop the skills and knowledge to become the environmental leaders of the future. All programs incorporate environmental justice education, hands-on projects, data collection and reporting, and program management and leadership development.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Creating and Implementing green spaces on school campuses requires collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders. GOG has ongoing and committed partners committed to providing support for successful implementation including but not limited to the Hawthorne School District, City of Hawthorne, Corporations (Kellogg Organic Gardens, LAcarGuy, etc), Tree-plenish, West Basin Municipal Water District, Supervisor Holly Mitchell and more!",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "For decades, the underserved and most vulnerable communities in LA have lacked green and outdoor space,\" said School Board Member Scott M. Schmerelson. Public schools are community hubs. 1 in 5 Californians visit public schools each year, whether to attend school, to pick up or drop off a child or to engage with other services. Green schoolyards transform asphalt-covered spaces into green space and fight climate change by reducing heat islands in urban areas. Research also shows that green spaces on or around a school campus help improve student well-being, physical and mental health, as well as academic performance. Green schools will create engaged, empowered and proactive leaders of the future, create opportunities for social and emotional development and strengthen local communities. Through this funding, GOG will collaborate with school districts, teachers, community members and partners to design, implement and ensure longevity of green spaces and gardens through student led programs at every school in the Hawthorne School district located in a highly environmentally challenged city. Uniquely, Grades of Green not only provides the resources for implementation of green spaces but ensures their endurance through project based, student-led, NGSS aligned programs. All programs are offered at no cost providing the resources, tools, leadership skills and training for students and teachers in the communities most in need.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "GOG is dedicated to creating change through student led projects in the communities most in need. 41% of the CA schools that have the highest pollution burden are located in LA County, identified through CalEnviroScreen, which uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores. These schools are also in communities with the least amount of green space. With a focused and targeted approach, GOG intends to reach every district identified and create gardens, green space and environmental education on every campus. The funding will allow for full school implementation in the Hawthorne School District. Successful implementation during the 2023-2024 school year in the include:1) planning, support and guidance for school district, teachers and schools including tools, resources and training), 2) free environmental project-based education for students/teachers 3) creation of edible gardens, green spaces and trees 4) Community outreach and involvement."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "For decades, achievement levels for L.A. County students have been markedly below the national average, according to the U.S. Department of Education. It is well-established that \"lesser-than\" educational opportunities correlate with lower earnings, poorer physical and mental health, and the hobbling of neighborhoods in cycles that can repeat for generations. On an immediate level, this largely affects neighborhoods of majority lower-income BIPOC residents (Black, indigenous, and people of color) and immigrants; over time, it degrades the entire region. Un-equal quality of education has been the case in too many L.A. County schools and communities for too long. In light of California's new focus on civics and arts education and learning loss brought on by the pandemic, the present moment is opportune to empower teachers with enhanced training, support, and new approaches - such as DBL - to provide a better education and brighter futures for their students.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "This is a project of Center X and UCLA Partner Schools in collaboration with the UCLA Center for Community Schooling. Center X will provide professional development/training for teachers including monthly guidance sessions. We will also hold a Family/Community STEAM Night event and will work with the Center for Community Schooling to collect data. UCLA Partner Schools will support teachers in their use of DBL and will open a dialogue with the community about the program.

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This project represents a new phase of an existing initiative to test DBL and introduce it widely. Since 2018, teachers at the San Gabriel Unified School District, under the guidance of Center X, have been employing DBL in K-12 classrooms. Qualitative feedback gathered in monthly sessions has been highly positive, with teachers reporting fewer classroom disturbances and improved engagement among students. The UCLA \"Cultivating Curiosity\" project will be our first introduction of DBL at UCLA Partner Schools and our first in South L.A. Because Mann UCLA Community School already has a research apparatus connected to the UCLA School of Education's Center for Community Schooling, we will be able to measure success both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of student engagement, testing achievement, and teacher/school leader satisfaction. Given the participatory nature of community schools, research will include input from the community, including how success will be measured.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 90",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We believe that wide adoption of DBL could be a sea change in the education of L.A. County public-school students. In an immediate sense, the county would benefit by having approximately 2,700 students with greater understanding of their city and county, through the exercise of designing a \"City of the Future\" iteratively, in multiple subject environments. Through creative envisioning of a City of the Future (how resources might be shared, transportation) and through the practice of cooperation and inclusion that are built in to DBL, students will be better equipped to be positive citizens of the county. Success of DBL in UCLA Partner Schools would benefit students at other schools by encouraging school leaders to train their teachers in DBL. In the meantime, Center X is seeking funding to open as many as six new community school campuses. The research collected from schools would benefit DBL at those sites, and teachers trained in DBL could provide training at the new campuses.",

Ten hours will be devoted to community outreach programs including a Community STEAM Night event. A series of interactive professional development sessions will take place once per month from Oct 2023 - Oct 2024, presented by UCLA instructors. Sessions will introduce teachers to instructional strategies that engage diverse learners in higher- level thinking through hands-on design challenges including the design and building of a City of the Future. Additional sessions will be offered focused on curriculum and lesson planning with support from UCLA Instructors. Sessions will focus on introducing best practices and example projects from UCLA DBL Teacher Leaders. The culmination of the project will be a Community STEAM Night event to feature designs created by students and a celebration of the Cities of the Future they have imagined, developed, and governed for the school year. Invitees will include LA2050 funders, community members, and K-12 LA education leaders. Long-term goals are to build an archive of projects and increased leadership capacity of UCLA Partner School teachers to share DBL with new colleagues and at UCLA."

However, many participants do not work as much as they would like because they are in fear of losing essential benefits, aka the befits cliff, and not being able to survive on just their wages. The benefits cliff refers to a situation where individuals experience a sudden loss or reduction in government assistance as their income increases. In Los Angeles, this phenomenon can prevent individuals from working to their full potential. Through this grant, we will provide the support and resources needed to participants to allow them to work to their full potential without losing (or being able to replace) housing, healthcare, or other essential services. We will do this by bringing in a program manager who will focus on designing a curriculum, tracking tools, and evaluation metrics for all artists in the certification program. They will also teach group soft skills classes that focus on participants' needs, including how to prepare for work and the resources they need to successfully avoid the benefits cliff.

Not only does this improve the individual lives of foster youth, it will also benefit the Los Angeles community at large given that foster care has historically and traditionally contributed to societal challenges of incarceration, unemployment, mental health costs, and sex trafficking. Program outcomes include: 1) increase in soft and hard skills and core competencies related to career and financial literacy; 2) increase in educational and/or professional attainment; and 3) change in mental health, or increase in hopefulness, toward future prospects and opportunities.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "More than half of California's 60,000 foster youth live in Los Angeles County. The average foster youth changes placements 8 times before emancipation, but many move through 20-50 placements before aging out. The trauma of constant instability puts emancipated youth at higher risk for homelessness, incarceration, trafficking, mental and physical health challenges. Transitional-aged youth are at a clear disadvantage when it comes to higher educational attainment and finding a job that pays a realistic living wage. Foster youth without support networks to lean on are sent into the world at 18 or 21 with a trash bag, a list of homeless shelters, and few resources to meet the demands of adulthood. Without proper support, 20% experience homelessness, while only 24% graduate high school, 10% enroll in college, and 3% graduate from college. We believe that system-impacted youth deserve equal access to opportunities to reach their greatest potential.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The core of our mission is to build a community that foster youth can rely on for support, and to provide opportunities that help them maximize their own potential. We believe that one meaningful connection can have a lasting impact to help foster youth self-actualize and thrive after the system. With our cornerstone program, CareerX, we match former foster youth with a one-on-one trained career coach for 9 months to develop the foundational life skills, social networks, and confidence they need to enter the workforce and adulthood with greater self sufficiency. Coaches meet with mentees each month, using our curriculum with particular emphasis on relationship building, life skills, financial literacy, and career development. This grant will support our program delivery by improving our current matching algorithms in the pairing of foster youth and their coaches. We are aiming to sophisticate the matching process to include pairings based on personality and psychological models to optimize the potential for foster youth and their coaches to create thriving, productive relationships that result in long-term impact. We are planning to build out this technology so that it will be able to serve not only as a centralized platform for matching and live session feedback, but also as a hub for communication between participants, training and learning, job opportunities, and alumni networking.",

She took up the quilter's offer. Lizz's mind would calm with the detailed work. Deciding colors and designs became cathartic. She envisioned Q4C, a workshop space where people of all ages, and cultures could learn together and experience the art of quilting free-of-charge, as she had. Lizz believed with this opportunity, others would find relief from their heartaches as well.

Within DEUCE Community, we are attempting to solve for a lack of self-belief in individuals coming out of prison and off the streets.

A roadmap for how to get from where they are currently to where they want to go. A positive and uplifting community to belong to. A safe home environment. An opportunity to chase their edges and grow in a field they are passionate about. If all of these things come true, the way in which society approached the issues of recidivism, homelessness, and long term substance use would change drastically. We would begin to view those affected by these things as people instead of problems. We would start to understand that transformation is accessible to anyone who puts in the work and who is surrounded by people who believe in them until they believe in themselves. We believe in a world where anything is possible and where anybody who is motivated and hungry can have a seat at the table."

Green Dot Public Schools has 19 schools with over 11,000 students across Los Angeles, and 94% of its students are classified as low-income, which is 18% higher than the Los Angeles Unified School District. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified youth mental health problems -- including student anxiety, depression, anger and suicidal ideation. School administrators have been scrambling to implement programs for prevention and early intervention that are equitable and accessible. Studies in the Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology found that participation in physical activities that foster resilience, such as skateboarding, can reduce stress that leads to those mental health problems among youth.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Concrete Queenz will launch \"Ride to Resilience,\" an after-school skateboarding program that will engage 50 girls ages 18 and under from Green Dot Public Schools during the 2023-2024 school year. The program addresses the mental health crisis that South LA schools face by providing administrators with an accessible and inclusive model for physical activity and resilience-building that starts with a skateboard, helmet, pads, shoes, and any flat ground surface. We combine a mentor-guided skateboarding curriculum with a supportive community environment of industry professionals who understand the unique challenges girls face. These mentors, experienced Olympic-bound skateboarders and advocates for equity in the sport, will provide not just technical guidance, but also emotional support and role modeling. Activities include weekly skill-building sessions, monthly mentor-led discussions on topics like perseverance and self-confidence, and a culminating field trip to a skatepark to record footage as part of each student's capstone portfolio. By weaving skateboarding lessons with empowerment themes, we nurture both physical and mental resilience. \"Ride to Resilience\" is unique as it addresses play equity directly within a historically male-dominated sport, providing girls a sense of belonging and achievement.

By increasing participation of South LA girls in skateboarding - an Olympic sport - we hope to see more local representation in regional, national, and potentially, global competitions. Our program will disrupt the gender imbalance in the sport, positioning LA as a leading city in fostering gender inclusivity within skateboarding. Equitable play will be promoted as we create safe, inclusive spaces for girls to learn and practice skateboarding, breaking down barriers that have historically excluded them. Our work aims to develop a generation of girls who are mentally stronger and more equipped to face life's challenges - including stress, anxiety, and depression. Our program will not just physically transform the landscape of South LA, but also shift societal attitudes towards girls in sport, making LA a model city for others to follow."

Eastside renters have some of the lowest paying and least secure jobs as well as the highest reported Covid-19 positive-testing rates throughout LA. They took the hardest financial hit from the pandemic, and now their rent repayment deadlines loom even as their economic hardships persist. Meanwhile, real estate market-driven increases in average rent prices continue to price out long-term residents. The forces against housing affordability are powerful. Only a powerful community-led response can overcome them.",

This work is a major component of the ICS community's long-term vision for a healthy, stable, and strong Eastside and LA County where all families are supported with pathways to thrive. This means protecting community voter bases who lead the way for effective solution-making. Amidst these crucial moments of pandemic recovery, ICS is positioning ongoing community leadership on holding decision-makers accountable to further advance policies and practices that provide LA's most vulnerable families with all the social safety and opportunity available to wealthier ones."

Many nonprofit activities seemingly entrenched in the constant needs of communities were problems continue to maintain their sense of despair that can become more of a 'customer base' than solvable solutions. For example, as homelessness continues to increase, though much financial assistance has been channeled to solve it, few homegrown experienced organizers come together to facilitate change. The Charrettes are to implement exactly that... safe spaces to solve the conflicts from the perspective of people who have 'lived' it and map 'real' solutions. With enough traction from the evidence of issues that intersect, coming forth in these Charrettes, it provides the empirical based statistics to validate that the problems are shared not individualistically rather collectively. And this brings 'asset based communal agreement and development'. Solutions come out of sincere and authentic processes that address direct issues over proposed suggestions. With each Charrette, Trusted Collectives (final step in the I.N.T.A.C.T. theory of change) are formed.

The initial 12-weeks (SSP101) takes participants through a curriculum to unlearn the ways in which patriarchy is perpetuated and internalized. Participants get clear on their Top 5 most important people and goals and reflect on whether or not their actions are in service of those. This is delivered by current graduates who are formerly incarcerated, survivors of violence, and people who have caused harm. SSP 201 is a cultural organizing model in which alumni join peer pods/circles where they continue the conversation on how to embody behaviors and beliefs learned in SSP 101, practice accountability in real time and co-create toolkits based on areas of continued support identified within pods.This lifelong network is a community of people who can respond to crises like physical violence, signs of unhealthy relationships, trauma responses like drug and alcohol with skills rooted in accountability and not punishment and fear. In addition to collecting quantitative data throughout, we will have a focus group at the end of the grant period in order to understand how SSP 101 and SSP 201 are allowing participants and their loved ones to relate to each other and notions of community safety differently than prior to going through the program.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Initial assessments were limited because from 2014-2019 we were operating in a prison but graduation rates, attendance and feedback sessions were collected. In 2021, SSP hired the Marginalia Research Group, to develop and implement a longitudinal quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Their intensive site study in early 2022, which included observation and interviews, demonstrated positive impact on participants in terms of relatability, vulnerability and perceptions of meaningful personal change. A second study at another site entailed two-way t-test analysis of participant surveys using previously validated measures of self- efficacy (Tsai et al 2013) and confidence (Heatherton and Polivy (1991). These demonstrated statistically significant increases in accountability, taking responsibility for choices, as well as acting congruently with inner self and values. The researchers also found that participants are engaging \"new concepts of masculinity in healthy and productive ways.\"",

We all had these great dreams when we were little kids...I'm willing to assert that everybody put the patriarchal expectations that the world had on us before our own goals.\" Richie Reseda, Co-founder Patriarchy is at the root of violence (gun, intimate partner, gang, etc.) and the carceral response to it. Buying into the societal model of masculinity, being emotionless, physically domineering, accumulating wealth and objectifying women, is a risk factor -exacerbated by systemic racism and limited mental health resources - for causing harm and being incarcerated for it. Those returning home from incarceration lack peer-led, and shame free environments to be vulnerable and reflect on the root cause of their maladaptive beliefs and behaviors. This is a substantial and frequently overlooked risk for recidivism (rate around 50%) as a lack of emotional support often leads to continued cycles of interpersonal and communal violence.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles is one of the most carceral jurisdictions in one of the most carceral states in the most carceral country in the world. LA is also entrenched with gun and gang violence. Our vision for this project and our work overall is to model ways in which we can address harm without perpetuating the trauma and oppression of punishment systems like prison. \"Success Pods\" will be one of many proofs of concept. Each person's engagement in countering patriarchal norms has ripple effects within their families, friend circles, places of work and worship. In prison, where violence is currency, our participants, members of rival gangs, walk the yard together, break bread together. We envision this radical shift across the county. By offering collective care and healing for both those harmed as well as those who have caused harm, we create safer communities that use accountability not punishment to sustain long-term transformation.",

Access to STEAM learning is not enough to solve the problems created by racism, misogyny and poverty. The girls we serve have histories of school failure, trauma, homelessness, recent immigration, low English fluency, justice and foster care involvement, and significant academic and social-emotional needs require deeply engaging, relevant and culturally competent programming that changes their beliefs about who they are and what they can become. This kind of STEAM education not only opens the door to a new world of possibilities powered by college access, it also creates the skills and determination young women of color can use to challenge the status quo.",

Weekly science classes (biology, chemistry, space science and engineering) offered in partnership with the California Science Center (CSC), taught by expert instructors in two-hour instructional and laboratory experiences. The bilingual curricula, written for New Village using Next Generation Science Standards, focuses on experiential learning and provides the A-G credits required for admission to the University of California system and other four-year colleges. 2. Our environmental engineering class teaches students about sustainability issues facing city planners and residents in Los Angeles. Students meet with industry professionals, and work in teams to design/build a prototype solution to the issue they are studying. Most recently, students studied food apartheid and designed a hydroponic garden to grow fresh produce on campus for distribution to the larger community. 3. La Fabrica, our on-campus makerspace, provides after-school opportunities for students to employ design thinking skills, and problem solve and collaborate with others while gaining technological competence with tools and technology. 4. STEAM-based internships include career training opportunities in healthcare fields, a STEAM team internship to expand students' skills in coding, design and prototype building for competition with other high school students in the Los Angeles region.

Further, 24% of all insured adults reported barriers to care for mental and substance abuse services and 40% medical enrollees did not receive treatment. This evidence points to the major disparity between seekers and providers in the market. Utilizing AI's power, we can develop a virtual friend that someone can use whenever needed.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Virtual friend is unique in that a conversational AI tool is built specifically to address social anxiety as of writing has yet to be developed. We are currently building a virtual agent that someone can use to engage in conversation. The AI tool uses a large language model (LLMs) that generates a spoken output based on what a person says to it. Most AI tools (like chat GPT) use text as output. Our tool uses a human face and speaks using audio so it appears to be a real human. This virtual friend can help those that need someone in the moment or are lonely. It helps a core human need, to be connected. There are some steps that need to be taken in order to achieve this. Since this virtual friend is technically complex, it requires a complex software architecture for which freelance software engineers must be hired for specific tasks.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In the average academic year, a total of 2500 2nd-5th grade students received 20 hours of science instruction through the YSP science curriculum, presented at a total of seven schools. The YSP program doubled the number of science lessons typically taught in these LAUSD schools. When students' subjective scientific knowledge was assessed through pre- and post-program science interest surveys, there was a 40% increase in what students believed they knew about science before and after receiving lessons from our STEAM program. Results from the Draw A Scientist Tests (DASTs) showed increases in the number of students who drew themselves as scientists, URMs & women on their post-program DAST, in comparison to pre-program DAST tallies. In addition to the impact YSP has had on the participating elementary school students, nearly 85 teachers received assistance and training in science instruction through professional development workshops and access to YSP curriculum materials.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "K-12 STEAM Education",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Research has indicated that when elementary school students are exposed early to STEM education that this will positively impact their perception of the topic. However, there is currently a lack of STEM-based curricula for elementary school teachers and consequently, less access to quality STEM instruction for students around the country. Many elementary school teachers lack the pedagogical expertise in STEM concepts including scientific inquiry and technological design to translate them into tangible hands-on based lessons and therefore tend not to use STEM-heavy curricula with their students. As a result science instructional time is declining in elementary schools and students are less frequently given a spark for science and tend to have lower achievements in science. However, by introducing early grade elementary school students to a STEM-integrated curriculum based on interactive problem solving activities, interest in STEM career fields increases.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The YSP science curriculum functions as an effective supplement of current science instruction in Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) schools. It incorporates Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), as well as LAUSD and statewide grade-level science learning standards, with the ultimate goal of strengthening science literacy and promoting interest in scientific careers. YSP's primary objectives are to present accessible and engaging science lessons to the neighborhood children around the university, assist in alleviating the fear and stress that is often associated with studying science, and help students apply what they learn in the classroom to the real world and to their own lives. In addition to the myriad positive benefits of YSP for the neighborhood schools and students, YSP teaching assistants receive valuable opportunities and professional training to hone their mentorship skills and gain practical teaching experience, allowing them to be more informed about how to directly respond to the individual needs of the schools, communities and families.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The continuing goal of C-ASSETS is to cultivate and nurture students' interest in STEM in order to contribute to a K-12 pipeline of underrepresented & disadvantaged students who pursue STEM as a major in college and embark upon careers in STEM. Currently, the C-ASSETS staff is 70% female & 70% are people of color and would fall under the category of being considered an underrepresented minority (URM) in the STEAM fields. Five of the staff are scholars from the USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative, which means that they are scholars who are from the local community teaching in their own elementary schools, exemplifying the ultimate goal of C-ASSETS."

Additional services are available from SPY's Education & Employment Specialists, mental and physical health clinicians, and our Garden Program, which provides workshops on nutrition and access to healthy food. The program was created quickly at the end of 2021, to prevent foster youth from entering homelessness at the end of COVID relief funds, and was possible via a partnership formed between SPY, the Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS), the Center for Strategic Partnership, private philanthropy, and corporate partners. The Program is a pilot for DCFS, allowing direct referrals to a housing program for youth aging out of foster care. The program - now available to all unhoused youth -continues as a pilot in two ways: *DCFS continues testing the efficacy of being able to refer youth exiting foster care *We have moved the program from the initial hostel-like setting to a 9 bedroom house in Echo Park. The new site will allow for more personal space and communal activities, like cooking meals. With funds from LA 2050, we can enhance and evaluate this Emergency Housing model, with a goal of expanding its availability across the County.",

Specifically, in the short term, we will: *Maintain 95% housing occupancy *Have 100% of residents participate in Case Management *Provide clinical services, education and employment, and life skills training for 100% of residents We will also hear from residents, like Tysaiah. Tysaiah aged out of the child welfare system during the pandemic, and moved into our Emergency Housing. Supported by SPY's services, he got a housing voucher and enrolled in college. He says of the program: \"I didn't have to worry about not having someone to support me...it's all here. It took some weight off my shoulders. A lot.\" Long term, we will track the number transitioning into longer-term housing, work with DCFS to promote this model around the county, and hear from hundreds of more youth like Tysaiah."

The youth's most valuable resources (time, health, and money) are at extreme risk. And with schools placing the burden of teaching these crucial concepts on parents, those from underserved areas are most neglected - perpetuating the poverty cycle. By increasing life literacy in our community, more people can achieve financial freedom, be healthier, and have more meaningful relationships. This triggers more inclusive growth to all people and the networks that power our society."

Here's how: With your support, we will hire up to 50 young adults a year to complete our intensive, 160-hour paid internship, with a curriculum focused on securing safe, stable, affordable housing. Interns will: Research and map the landscape of post-foster care housing options (public, transitional, specialized program, standard and luxury apartments). Develop scripts and best practices for communicating with landlords, property managers, partners and roommates. Gain financial management skills for independent living. Make arrangements to furnish a space, understand appliances like water heaters and fuse boxes, arrange utility set-up and other logistics. Learn to build healthy relationships and resolve conflict with roommates, neighbors, and property managers. With these skills, interns will help each other as well as an additional 80 young adults searching for housing. Young adults will receive wrap-around services, mentorship, and life skills education from our team for up to two years to ensure a smooth transition.

These partnerships allow access to an array of housing inventory that we will leverage to ensure that 100% of our interns move into stable housing. From this first group of housing interns, we'll develop best practices to scale the effectiveness of our app-based programming to benefit thousands more young adults.

In 2021, we launched the Stepping Forward mobile app that we developed in partnership with former foster interns and program alumnae. Designed to help youth transition from foster care, our app provides 24/7 access to resources, mentorship, and educational content (all of it created by former foster interns). With this grant, interns will focus on information and details to benefit any young adult seeking housing-related support.

Within a couple of years, only 57% of youth are employed (Annie E. Casey Foundation). On average, they'll earn less than poverty level wages and progress more slowly in the labor market than other youth (Health & Human Services). Young adults grow up in the foster care system not being able to make decisions or learn how to navigate the world. Then they age out and struggle to survive on their own. Our internship allows them to focus on securing stable housing for themselves and other foster youth while getting hands-on job experience. Our housing initiative will help them build a foundation to thrive in independent living while gaining skills, experience, a network of their peers and mentors along with a paycheck."

In addition, our clinics have benefited students' mental health by introducing physical activity and addressing any reluctance they had about participating in any sport activity. The positive feedback received from the classroom teachers has been phenomenal as they reported their students, those who were reluctant at the very beginning of our clinic, walked away fully immersed in the activity and having a great time.

At the same time, women have become the fastest growing incarcerated population, expanding by 700% since 1980. Women return home from prison to stigma, economic precarity, and a lack of supportive services. As Prison Policy Initiative has noted: \"Given the dramatic growth of women's incarceration in recent years, it's concerning how little attention and how few resources have been directed to meeting the reentry needs of justice-involved women.\" For trans and gender non-conforming people, discrimination adds to the impacts of structural racism and gender-based discrimination. Worsened by systemic disinvestment, these forces lead to a high recidivism rate for this group.

Guided by our formerly incarcerated leaders, we are collectively building an arts-based center for healing, education, and community. In response to the urgent needs of people leaving prison, we provide paid work opportunities and job training in the design, production, and distribution of the People's Bowl and other homewares. We also offer part-time work on a flexible schedule that provides economic stability to people in reentry. PPP offers ceramics classes free of cost to formerly incarcerated individuals. Arts programming is essential for healing trauma and helps recently incarcerated women establish a sense of self, power, and hope. This program offers an inspiring pairing of women in reentry and PPP staff who have navigated this transition home successfully and are leaders in their community. PPP recognizes the need for grassroots advocacy led by directly impacted communities. One of the primary barriers for formerly incarcerated people to advocate for systems change is economic stress and inflexible, low-wage jobs. PPP centers this advocacy by encouraging leaders to participate in coalition movements for safety, justice, and ending mass incarceration.",

Birds successfully rehabilitated are given \"second chances\" and return to a normal life. They participate in normal species behavior, such as producing and rearing offspring. Each of these outcomes is an important component of a balanced, diverse ecosystem. Our scientific data provides strong evidence that birds injured by human impact that we successfully rehabilitate (whether the impact is from oil, pollution, or other forms of human-caused Human Wildlife Conflicts such as habitat loss, food scarcity, abandonment, climate change, or fishing entanglements) lead lives that are long and productive.",

    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA County will be different because regular citizens will become environmental champions. They will develop environmental literacy and express empathy as they keep themselves safe, and rescue birds in distress, saving future generations. Because we provide our rescue, rehabilitation, response, and Bird HelpLine services for free to the public on an ongoing basis, we keep our skills and our facility ready to respond to unpredictable, yet sadly-inevitable environmental crises that occur, such as the three well-publicized catastrophes we responded to in the last two years: the Long Beach Harbor Seabird Rescue (which saved over 3,000 near-threatened Elegant Terns after a human-piloted drone crashed in their nesting grounds), the Amplify Pipeline Rupture near Huntington Beach, and the 2022 Pelican Crisis.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Birds are sensitive indicators of changes in our environment. Experts around the world agree that aquatic birds are in crisis and that their health is failing. The causes of this population collapse are almost all caused by humans, and affect us as well. They include injury from illegal shootings, habitat disruption and loss, starvation, pollution (including plastics, chemicals, and oil spills), and climate change. LA is especially important to hundreds of species of aquatic birds (many that are endangered or threatened) because of its central location on the Pacific Flyway: a major North-South migratory route along the coasts of North and South America. Immediate human impact here has concentrated, long-term effects on the global wildlife population. As a globally-recognized leader in human-wildlife conflicts, we are uniquely positioned to make a difference through both direct service, and by giving people ways to take action meaningful and effective action that saves lives.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "At our Los Angeles Wildlife Center, our Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitate program serves an average of 1,500 native birds each year, and releases them back into the wild. Since our inception, we have rescued and rehabilitated over 160,000 wild animals, representing over 115 different species. We also respond to unpredictable yet sadly inevitable environmental crises in our Emergency Response and Preparedness program. Over the past 50 years, we have responded to over 250 environmental disasters, many of which affect Los Angeles and Southern California. We treat the most challenging injury cases that are beyond the capacity or skills of other regional wildlife centers and clinics, and respond to the most acute environmental disasters (such as oil and chemical spills) when they occur, in real time. While many focus on systemic issues such as habitat loss/conservation, we provide equally important, immediate, and present day responses that mitigate human impact and save and improve the lives of individual animals and people. We've extended our impact with our free Bird HelpLine, that helps people and birds through conservation, advocacy, and environmental literacy that builds empathy and encourages positive action."

    "summary": "Thriving communities depend on equity, inclusion, and the investment in the diverse people who live in them. Building the foundations of young people leaving homelessness and providing safe, affordable housing options is one of the most significant prevention strategies for reducing long-term and chronic homelessness. CHC's innovative youth- centered 12-Unit Affordable Housing Complex represents a vital step in ending youth homelessness and in reducing LA's poverty rate by 2050.",
    "goal": "LIVE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "LA County has the highest poverty rate in CA (22.3%), affecting 1 in every 4 children - disproportionately affecting Youth of Color. While less than 6% of CA's youth are Black, they're 83% more likely to become homeless. These disparities highlight the systemic challenges and inequality youth experience at an early age that lead to homelessness. Affordable housing is critical for the more than 1,000 young Angelenos we serve (ages 18 to 24) annually, who have worked incredibly hard to overcome homelessness. LA's high cost of living (monthly rents increasing 16% since 2019 to a median of $2,258 (HUD) and inflation sitting at a 40-year high), make it nearly impossible for many youth to secure and maintain housing, even though employed and ready for their first apartment. For all Angelenos to thrive, there must be equitable solutions, especially for youth who have overcome tremendous odds.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Located mere blocks from our LA campus, CHC's Pico Affordable Housing Complex offers 12 safe and newly remodeled studio apartments for formerly homeless youth who are eager to become contributing members of this vibrant community. With rental rates based on 30% of their income, Pico provides a soft landing for young Angelenos to navigate their newly developed employment and budgeting skills while balancing life's inevitable challenges. We anticipate residents moving in by September, and they will all have access to additional supportive services at the main campus as needed to thrive. Purchased with philanthropic dollars, CHC owns the building. The operating costs are limited and include two personnel positions consisting of a Community Manager and Resident Assistant who will provide light touch support when needed (case management/community resource connections). After the first year of operations, this innovative model is self-sustainable, as the rent paid for the units annually will cover the operating expenses and personnel- making this project a long-term solution in addressing the issues outlined in question 6. Pico represents a systemic approach in reducing generational poverty and chronic homelessness in LA. It demonstrates to youth, as a community, that our collective dedication to their success extends well beyond what exists through traditional housing programs. It's a demonstration that their hard work indeed holds relevance and success in the real world.",

Are we; (1) ensuring safe, quality permanent housing despite tenant's income level, (2) reducing the risk factors of returns to homelessness and, (3) contributing to a reduction in poverty and homelessness in LA County. Quantitatively, data on tenancy, timely rental payments, and returns to homelessness will be tracked using CHC's internal data tool, ETO (Efforts to Outcome). Regular analysis will be used to inform and improve program outcomes during the year. All agency leadership meets monthly to review and discuss program successes/challenges and ways we will refine deliverable goals and objectives. In-person interviews and focus groups capture narrative engagement for qualitative analysis of upward mobility.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Creating affordable, quality housing of any kind in LA County can be viewed as a success. Making affordable housing opportunities more accessible to resilient youth who have spent years overcoming homelessness, is a long-term solution to preventing housing insecurity and returns to homelessness. Pico benefits young people who deserve access to live affordably and thrive in the community they love. It's also a beautiful benefit to the community. As youth enhance their independence, they work, pay taxes, buy groceries, rent/buy homes, and volunteer. Success for the first year is to have, 100% tenancy, 100% tenants paying rent on time, no returns to homelessness, and organic transitions for youth achieving upward mobility. The long-term impact would be to leverage the project's success for a replicable model that leads to county-wide access to affordable living options. In turn, contributing to LA achieving the lowest poverty, homeless, and inequality rates in the nation by 2050.",

Our staff (95% BIPOC) and leadership (70% BIPOC) have a deep understanding of the mental health challenges faced by the predominantly Latinx and BIPOC youth and families in the Southeast LA communities we serve. The LA County Human Relations Commission, responding to the County Board of Supervisors, identified County schools where students were in need of inclusive spaces. The Commission's hate crime reports are available at https://hrc.lacounty.gov/stop-violence-2. HYC operates Dream Resource Centers at six LA County middle and high schools providing immigrant, LGBTQ+, BIPOC, English Language Learner, and other students at risk of racial and gender-based hate and bullying with safe and judgment-free spaces.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Youth and their families are often reluctant to access or receive mental health and/or substance use education and treatment due to the stigma associated with labels, fears and false beliefs, shame, fears of being seen at school accessing services, and lack of understanding by family or culture. Based on HYC's work with youth and families over the last three years, the pandemic and its aftereffects have only deepened youth hesitation and anxiety in accessing help for these serious concerns. During the pandemic, many youth lost access to support systems including friends, teachers, school personnel, faith leaders, and extended family due to restrictions and closures, with many youth only now beginning to regain confidence in social situations. Added to the mix is volatile tension between racial groups on school campuses, fueled by social media misinformation. HYC staff, bilingual English/Spanish, utilize evidence-based and culturally sensitive approaches to help Latinx and BIPOC youth overcome stigma, process fears, identify resources to make them feel safe, and normalize asking for help with mental, emotional, and substance use issues. These issues cause pain and trauma for young people and families and hold youth back from building a strong foundation for their futures. Without the support provided by HYC, the minimum 200 at-risk youth and their adult allies receiving services and training through this project have very few options to access these urgently needed resources."

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our impact speaks for itself. The trauma and instability that co-occur with chronic homelessness makes a strong case for rapid efforts to end unsheltered homelessness and the length of time an individual is homeless, ultimately reducing the cost/time to resolve their situation. Our approach is centered on seeing residents transition to stable housing within 6-12 months. With that in mind, the outcomes from our downtown Santa Barbara site are powerful and examples of what we will track in Norwalk. All residents work with an intensive case manager to create an exit plan for a secure, stable transition. As of May 2023, of the 34 individuals who moved in during Q3 of 2022: 8 individuals secured jobs 12 individuals transitioned to stable housing 29 individuals connected to health care 28 individuals connected to mental health services 85% residents are document ready for the next steps in the process 6-month average length of stay For more, watch our DignityNOW Santa Barbara video.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "DignityMoves is partnering with the City of Norwalk to develop a strategic homelessness plan to address their unsheltered population to be completed by 10/31/23. As one of the strategies, we are introducing a LA County proof of concept model, with Norwalk leading the charge. Using our DignityNOW approach and innovative model, we propose development of interim supportive housing for small to mid-sized cities with lower PIT counts by building enough transitional housing to get everyone off their streets with a prioritization for their residents. Key to our success is using underutilized and low cost land, emergency building codes, and modular and prefabricated cabin systems with a focus on building communities not just rooms. DignityMoves strategizes with city leadership providing the following services 1) identify appropriate and cost-effective land, 2) unlock funding channels especially from the private sector, 3) hire housing development and construction teams, 4) develop site plans, 5) provide construction management, and 6) help identify and partner with the supportive services agency. Norwalk is the perfect candidate to launch this model as their PIT count is 311 individuals as of 2022. Norwalk has been a proven leader and innovator in developing effective homelessness solutions that can be replicated by other LA County cities. This is due to deep alignment across their city agencies on how they want to address homelessness and create a thriving community for all.",

The model has the potential to significantly reduce pressure on the County to be the major funding source, and entrusts cities to implement locally specific solutions with an engaged stakeholder group. Interim supportive housing plays a vital role in accelerating the speed and flow of getting people off the streets and into stable housing. Our target goal is an average stay of 6-12 months, which is dependent on having strong 24/7 wrap-around services, on-site management, and security. Long-term, we want to close the transitional housing gap to immediately address the needs of all who become homeless, and provide stabilization services so they can move to affordable/supportive housing before becoming chronically homeless.",

This is a humanitarian crisis and it is unacceptable. In fact, Mayor Bass' first action was to declare a state of emergency on homelessness. Despite efforts to increase housing production, there is no feasible path to build sufficient affordable housing in California given budget, land, and zoning realities-even as the homelessness crisis exacts an unacceptable toll on those without a home, and their communities. Permanent supportive housing takes 5+ years to build and costs $6-800k/unit. DignityMoves units cost $50k/unit and can be built in 6 months.

Over 200,000 LA youths including 36% of military-connected dependents have recorded mental health issues that affect all areas of life, including physical well-being, the ability to work and perform well in school, and to participate fully in family and community activities. MindYumm is needed to improve bio/mental metric screenings and increase awareness of and to community-based resources for all LA youth. In support of our work, Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Debra Duardo said, \"... We must remove barriers to access and continue our efforts to destigmatize help-seeking around mental health. We must also recognize that physical and mental health is crucial to teaching and learning. I look forward to continuing this critical work with our partners as we strive to improve educational and life outcomes for all children.\""

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Greater Los Angeles is rich in educational resources, including hundreds of opportunities for children and youth to learn out of school time (OST). While research has shown that these OST opportunities can significantly increase student learning and success, access to them is not always easy and equitable. Many students of color and children from low-income or marginalized communities are unable to access OST experiences. Low-income families are outspent as much as 10x by wealthy families on out-of-school enrichment. A recent study by the Afterschool Alliance showed that nearly 362,000 children in LA who would be enrolled in a program if one were available to them. Families often do not know where to turn to access OST resources or support. OST providers also are fragmented, without a centralized tool for families to access information and resources about OST opportunities in LA County.",

The portal is more than a website; it is a multi-faceted tool that will evolve as the needs of its multiple distinct audiences change. When completed, the portal will target children and youth, adults and families, teachers and school administrators, and all members of the public, connecting them to the large variety OST opportunities, including STEM programs, museum and afterschool programs, camps, mental health programs, arts programming, sports programs, community-based organizations and non-profit programming. The portal will implement strategies to keep information up to date while efficiently connecting users through a variety of avenues, including location, content and cost categories, and connecting them to registration processes. The digital portal has two main components: a comprehensive, searchable database of all of the out-of-school time opportunities in Los Angeles County accessible online through web and mobile platforms, that presents information in as intuitively as possible to all audiences; and a highly interactive digital map that will allow the public to see OST opportunities around them or throughout the region.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Children spend most of their lives out of the classroom. LA County is rich in out-of-school time (OST), also know as expanded learning, opportunities that engage children afterschool, on weekends and during school breaks. The County does not, however, have a central repository of information to access all of these resources and opportunities, nor does it have a comprehensive understanding of the locations and scope of the OST community. Without a hub for accessing this information, families, teachers and schools rely on ad hoc methods to connect to OST resources, which could lead some to missing opportunities. The LA Enrichment Hub will give the County a focus of information about its OST community. The map feature will share the landscape of OST opportunities, better connecting the public to local resources and allowing policy makers to make informed decisions on resource allocation. The portal is one step to connecting all of LA County to the benefits of OST learning.",

This beta Phase will serve as a test-bed for usability for all the eventual target audiences, including youth, families and teachers. This phase will be successful is the intended school audience uses it, but more importantly, if the development team is able to learn valuable lessons to hone the final, Phase 2, portal. Looking toward the future, the LA Enrichment Hub is intended to improve access to OST opportunities to the children of LA County, especially those students of color or from communities traditionally underresourced or marginalized. An increase in enrollment in these opportunities will be the ultimate marker of the project's success. Consistent usage numbers also will point to its benefit.",

Project success will look like: fully utilized housing units with a pipeline of young men at every phase of the SHP service continuum; work-ready participants who are working part-time while in college or seeking full-time, living wage employment to support permanent housing; skillful, culturally relevant and trauma-informed counseling delivered in a coaching rather than therapy-session format as preferred by participants and alums; and life skills building integrated into every service for a safe and supported launch into purposeful, self-sustaining, community-connected adulthood.",

The agency has identified this property and finalized the lease. The housing capacity of the property is 20 beds due to SHP's innovative pod concept that builds out bedrooms to house 2-4 members with privacy and technology capacity. Funding from LA2050 will be used to renovate, furnish, equip and stock the new house, including community convening space and a computer center. The goal of SHP is to provide a holistic, supportive environment in which participants can transition into sustainable, permanent housing. Upon move-in, residents work with their Member Success Case Manager to develop a plan, with action steps and benchmarks, to establish employment and permanent housing. Those plans are supported by case management, life skills training, a savings program, and move-in assistance supported by the Change Reaction Foundation that matches residents' savings up to $1,600, assists with moving deposits and helps purchase furnishings for apartments. Members of SHP must be homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless, male or self-identifying as male, and have previous system involvement. Residents are not required to be full-time students, though 95% attend college or vocational training.",

Data is collected in SHP's customized Apricot client data management system. During its last fiscal year, SHP provided transitional housing to 30 young men and helped 22 to secure permanent housing. Of those who have lived in residence, 78% are enrolled in school full-time, 70% maintain permanent housing and just 8% exited the program and experienced a re-occurrence of homelessness, 22 members had paid internships, 80% of members opened bank accounts and improved their financial status, and members accessed 480 hours of therapy."

The alumni gather for weekly workshops where they practice a 16th century Italian art form, Commedia dell'Arte - the \"Style\", where emotional states (happy, sad, afraid and angry) and the 14 archetypal characters are explored. Currently, TAGAAP is limited to previous participants of the program. With LA2050 funding, TAGAAP will expand programming and opportunities to any formerly incarcerated person in Los Angeles County to participate in weekly workshops and monthly Council Circles and join the alumni network. The alumni informally help each other navigate Parole, modern systems like bank accounts, technology, DMV and relationships. They also help each other secure employment and housing. TAGPP's staff offers guidance and assistance to alumni for career and business development. Those who receive support are less likely to fall into destructive old habits. The recidivism rate in California is approximately 62%; it is 10% among TAGAPP alumni. TAGPP has trained and employed alumni; three are in full-time staff positions; a total of 27 alumni have been trained and hired as Teaching Artists (TAs); 18 are still active.

Approximately 10,000 individuals are released from prison annually into Los Angeles County. There is a high recidivism rate among those who are released because little has been done to address the core systemic issues of mass incarceration or provide for a supportive reentry into the community. Formerly incarcerated people often face challenges in finding employment, housing, navigating the Parole system, social integration and little or no access to the arts. They can slip into desperate and risky behaviors which lands them back in prison. And so, the cycle continues. Until systemic changes are made to eliminate mass incarceration, TAGAAP will help those returning to the community. This program meets people where they are and provides a safe space for them to recognize and experience their emotions and build community together.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "For 17 years, TAGPP has worked with incarcerated and returning adults and youth, has a proven track record of success and is supported and respected throughout the Nation by government agencies and other non-profits who work in this space. If more returning citizens participate in TAGAAP, there will be less recidivism, increased employment opportunities and safer communities. As more people return home, TAGAAP must have the capacity and resources to provide a safe space and opportunities for growth as individuals, as family members and productive community members. The expansion of TAGAAP relies on adding alumni as staff and TAs for success. This model works because the alumni are invested in the process and outcomes. The 57 TAGAAP network members contribute to and strengthen the greater Los Angeles Community.",

EO preserves business owners' legacies, gives workers a meaningful financial stake in the success their labor creates, and strengthens communities. Studies have repeatedly shown that EO is a powerful income and wealth building opportunity, and that these benefits can be life-changing, particularly for LMI workers and workers of color. Project Equity recently launched a multi-year partnership with the LA County Department of Economic Opportunity to build community wealth and retain local businesses through EO. LA2050 can help to strengthen and catalyze this work by enabling us to conduct ground-level market research into the needs of LA's legacy businesses. With LA2050's support, we will: 1. Craft and conduct a survey of LA County business owners age 55+ who have been in business for 10+ years and have 10+ employees in order to analyze the current state of the market for EO. This survey will assess owners' readiness to sell, their level of succession planning, and their familiarity with EO as a succession option. 2.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Low-to-moderate income (LMI) workers in Los Angeles, who are disproportionately Black and Latino, are trapped in a cycle of working poverty. The combination of low and stagnant wages, limited opportunities for advancement, and a rapidly rising cost of living have made it nearly impossible for these workers to participate fully in the LA economy, stay in their homes, and build generational wealth. At the same time, nearly half of the job-creating businesses in LA County have owners nearing retirement age, and the majority of those owners do not have succession plans. Many owners assume they will find a buyer, but only 20% of businesses listed actually sell. In LA County, these businesses employ 1 in 5 private sector workers and account for $237 billion in revenue. Without urgent intervention, this wave of retirements, known as the Silver Tsunami, will lead to widespread small business closures, resulting in massive job losses and upending the local economy.",

Christian, a baker at Proof, credited his increased earnings with enabling him to afford housing, saying, \"It's the difference between maybe one day I can own a home and, now I definitely will be able to own a home, even on a single income.\" In the short term, we will increase awareness of EO as a viable small business succession strategy among LA County business owners and accelerate our ability to impact local workers by building demand and capacity for EO transitions. In the long term, we envision that EO will increase wealth building opportunities for thousands of LMI workers, which will translate into greater housing stability and economic participation."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "A new challenge facing AAPI's over the past few years has been addressing the Covid-19 pandemic and its differing impacts on our community. During the height of the pandemic, AAPI Equity Alliance coordinated over $4M in ARPA funds to provide vaccination outreach to the AAPI community in partnership with 14 member organizations. AAPI Equity also led a collaborative of 18 organizations to address COVID-19 and its impacts on AAPIs. This collaborative provided culturally and linguistically appropriate outreach and education, offering PPE and vaccines to underserved AAPI immigrant community members. Multilingual community health workers translated materials into over twelve languages and engaged more than 271,000 community members. More importantly, the resources have strengthened the capacity of our organizations to serve the overall health needs of AAPI communities and also uncovered a myriad of other health equity and access needs that were previously underprioritized in our community.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "AAPI Equity Alliance's partners use a proprietary client tracking tool to ensure that each outreach is documented for future analysis. We engaged an external evaluator who reviewed 2-years' worth of program reports and conducted 25 key informant interviews with the subcontracting partners and three team lead agencies from the Community Health Worker Outreach Initiative collaborative to document learnings and recommendations for future CHW strategies. Key insights from the CHW's outreach and education efforts: -\tTrust and collaboration was key to effective outreach and education; -\tCommunity members were most receptive to outreach when they were treated as whole human beings; -\tVaccine resistance was often linked to a history of neglect in AAPI communities; -\tMessages needed to reach the audience's hearts as well as their minds; and -\tThe pandemic will have long-lasting repercussions for community members - particularly, on their economic well-being and mental health.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "AAPI Equity Alliance will continue to oversee 18 partners who will deploy over 50 Community Health Workers into the AAPI community across Los Angeles County. Our recent work over the past two years included nearly 13,000 outreach activities reaching over 734,000 people across the county, conducted both in-person and virtually. Among in-person outreach, 30.9% were at venue visits or events. Among virtual outreach, 63.6% was conducted by phone. In addition to these outreach activities, our partners distributed more than 36,000 printed materials, 212,000 face masks, and 41,000 hand sanitizers. Our healthcare collaborative not only reached a large number of community members, but they were able to connect and develop meaningful relationships through their multiple and sustained outreach efforts. Diversity among community members impacted how and when messages resonated with people. COVID-19 was a disease outbreak that demanded specific attention and resources. However, the impacts were not on health alone. COVID-19 exacerbated social determinants of health such as poverty, housing, food access, employment, violence, and racism. Addressing SDoH with an intersectional lens will better inform our community and policy work, and better address the whole person and their needs. We believe this continued work in the AAPI community will create opportunities for leveraging and creating synergy across sectors to maximize limited resources.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The success of our work will not only positively impact the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, but also improve the conditions of the underserved communities in LA County. Our success has allowed us to affect policy change at the local, county, and state levels, with respect to health equity and access. For example, we have advocated directly to agencies such as the Department of Public Health and the Department of Mental Health for broader geographic targeting of our communities in need, rather than place-based strategies, as AAPI's are geographically dispersed across the County. AAPI Equity Alliance has been at the forefront of advocacy efforts, serving as a vocal and visible advocate calling for increased awareness, education, and policy change to address the root causes that contribute to health inequities. AAPI Equity Alliance's innovative, non-traditional structure fosters the engagement of diverse community stakeholders who are leading the work on the ground.",

The goal this year is to launch the project and get as many kids playing lacrosse as possible by working with local City and County Parks. It will be difficult to offer teams at every park. The strategy is to select key parks that are spread throughout the county and focus on creating youth lacrosse programming there. Our focus parks are: Rancho Cienega Sports Complex, Exposition Park, Gilbert Lindsay, and LA County Victoria Park in Carson. The option to add or switch locations of \"champion parks\" will make it easier to allocate resources to run meaningful programs correctly and safely with coaches, equipment, supplies and access. Our leadership is best suited to take on this project. Not only have we lived through the youth/high school lacrosse experience in metro LA, but we have experience in former programs that attempted projects such as this.

Levitt LA's long-term commitment is to build community through music and the activation of a central public green space. The theory is that by removing barriers to accessing music and creating a safe environment, a warm welcoming atmosphere is cultivated where connection will happen easily. Activating MacArthur Park is key to the cultural fabric of Los Angeles given its central location, inherent diversity, connection to social justice movements, and significance to immigrant communities.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Dating back to the 1880s, MacArthur Park is one of the city's most historically significant parks. Early on, it was considered an urban oasis for wealthy residents.? During the 1980s, the area began to experience a decline due to disinvestment and a lack of infrastructure for the influx of Central American refugees. Coupled with the fact the area surrounding MacArthur Park, one of the poorest areas of Los Angeles, suffered from widely reported crime rates, the park became known for crime and violence. Redevelopment efforts in early 2000 by the LA Police Department and business and community leaders have been leading to increased safety measures to once again make the park a desirable location for LA residents. Levitt LA is one of the leaders of this effort towards having MacArthur Park be once again considered a cultural gem that inspires civic pride, uplifts the cultural expressions past and present of Los Angeles and beyond.",

The Student Scholarship Program also sustains the tuition-free Ensemble Program, which includes Jazz Ensemble, String Ensemble, Coro, and Community Band. Our Student Scholarship Program provides equitable financial support and access to high-quality music education. We offer lessons on a wide range of instruments, including standard band and orchestra instruments; acoustic, classical, and electric guitar; electric bass, ukulele, and voice. Students typically take one lesson per week on the instrument of their choice, and many play multiple instruments.

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "West LA",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Westwood Greenway provides green space where visitors can connect with nature. It models the benefits of sustainable practices and provides outdoor space for hands-on education, increased biodiversity, and public benefit. Our augmented reality (AR) project will encourage residents to visit the habitat more often, spend more time creatively engaged, and interact with content we will provide onsite. By overlaying interactive digital content onto the natural environment, to be visualized through any smartphone, AR will increase activities for imagination and exploration. It will captivate visitors' attention and curiosity about sustainable spaces and will encourage the restoration of LA's biodiversity. Visitors will see the wonder and complexity of the local native habitat as our virtual simulations bring the ecosystem to life. With the magic of AR, every visitor can virtually witness tiny sleeping bees in the Apricot Mallow, majestic Mourning Cloak butterflies, and the camouflaged Lesser Goldfinch. In addition, they can view how the land will grow healthier as it attracts species identified by our city as indicators of biodiversity and habitat quality. We will enable users to viscerally witness pollination, nutrient cycling, water filtration, and climate regulation. Through compelling activities, visitors will gain empathy and be inspired to take an interest in the world around them; and students contributing to the AR will be better prepared for careers in digital media.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 1,000",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Pilot or new project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Westwood Greenway will be the host location for the augmented reality experience. It is located at the Westwood/Rancho Park metro station along the E Line to Santa Monica and is owned by LA Sanitation. However, it is managed by the 501c3 Westwood Greenway Initiative's (WGI) 8-member board. Impact Immersive will be responsible for 100% of the budgeting, production, and development of the AR application, but we will rely heavily on WGI's board members for their habitat expertise in regard to content creation. Impact Immersive will make all final decisions about how much information we can include and the app functionality. We will look to Charles, Jonathan, and Annette (mentioned #11) for direction in regard to which flora attracts which fauna and details about how the ecosystem functions.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "iNaturalist is an app that helps people identify plants and animals. Users are creating research-quality data that can be used to discover if any of the 37 indicator species have moved into the Greenway. FOLLOW MY PHONE can be integrated with iNaturalist to make data capture easier and to encourage more data collection. To date, there have been 1000 visitors to the Greenway. As the unhoused situation improves and the property owner, LA Sanitation, becomes comfortable opening more days to the public, we anticipate that AR will entice many more visitors, increase time at the site, and help visitors to retain learnings better. We'll track our success through the number of app downloads, total time on the app, and what content the visitors spend the most time exploring. This will measure the impact our app will have on getting people outside, into nature, and onto the Greenway. We can directly quantify the number of students using this opportunity to contribute 3D artwork.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Green Space, Park Access, and Trees",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Excessive smartphone use can impair physical, mental, and social well-being, and disrupt sleep and academic performance. It also reduces opportunities for use of imagination, exercise, and outdoor exploration. Human well-being requires green spaces. Time in nature can reduce stress and improve learning ability, focus, emotional stability, and mental health. But our LA parks need our help to restore their biodiversity, which is essential for enhancing human health and supporting a sustainable environment. LA designated 37 species as indicators of habitat quality. According to the 2022 Westwood Greenway Biodiversity Index, none of these species had been spotted by volunteers gathering data with the iNaturalist app. We can solve both with productive use of smartphones via augmented reality (AR)-which can increase learning attention by 31% and motivation by 14%. We propose an AR smart phone application for the Westwood Greenway to entice digital natives outdoors to PLAY, LEARN, and LIVE.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Imagine a world where we all live in harmony with the Earth and each other-LA County with people outdoors enjoying pockets of thriving biodiverse ecosystems. FOLLOW YOUR PHONE directly impacts residents on the west side, but the ripple effect will be felt countywide. Every resident inspired to start a native garden will inspire neighbors, friends, and family to start their own, and they will inspire others. The Greenway's living model, plus our self-guided AR tour touting the benefits of restoring the ecosystem, entice people outdoors and make a compelling plea to plant native flora. In addition, we'll be teaching student artists how to prepare 3D artwork for AR, a valuable skill, thereby supporting them in building their potential digital media careers. FOLLOW YOUR PHONE, designed for the Westwood Greenway, can be repurposed and adapted for other native gardens: the Thomas Payne garden tours, botanical gardens throughout LA County, and beyond."

The visits enabled by participation in this program are unique; they are longer than standard permitted visits, and children and parents are allowed to participate in more bonding activities. Unlike during typical prison visits, incarcerated parents are allowed to move about freely. This means they can touch and hug their children as much as they want, they can play interactive games together, and parents can serve lunch to their children. Get On The Bus visits provide incarcerated parents the rare opportunity to parent their children. Photographs are taken with copies given to the parents (when permitted) and to the children, who receive the photo with a teddy bear \"gift\" from their parent. Get On The Bus removes multiple barriers to visitation. We provide free transportation regardless of the distance to the prison. Free meals and snacks are served, with overnight accommodations provided for trips that cannot be completed in one day. For months before visits can take place, our staff works with prison officials to secure visit dates and ensure that inmates are aware of our program and have the opportunity to sign up to participate. Finally, a key program component is helping children's guardians to receive security clearance. The complexity of this paperwork keeps many families from visiting, especially when English is not the family's native language.",

This makes it difficult or impossible for many low-income children and family members to visit to maintain contact or to begin a healing process while a parent is incarcerated. Get On The Bus has filled this gap for decades until the complete visitation shut down at the start of the COVID pandemic in March 2020. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) finally allowed in-person visits to resume in October 2022. The children who rely on Get On The Bus have not been able to see their parents in person for at least 30 months - or 2.5 years (March 2020 - October 2022), and for some, this wait will span a full 3 years by the time their scheduled visit day arrives.

The blossoming Community Land Trust movement has produced CLTs all over the County and the state, and even in Chinatowns across the continent. The next phase in starting up our CLT for implementation is an Organizational and Development Roadmap, which consists of (1) strategic planning, outreach and capacity building, and (2) real estate development strategy. The work will begin with co-creating a strategic plan with the community members to identify near-and long-term goals. This will include extensive outreach and capacity building to build relationships with residents, stakeholders and longtime Chinatown property owners currently at risk of selling their buildings, through community visioning exercises, developing popular education materials. As that is ongoing, the real estate development strategy will involve a strategic planning process to identify and develop a pipeline of sites to implement strategies for new construction and acquisition for affordable housing preservation, including identifying naturally occurring affordable housing, developing site selection criteria, and engaging with non-profit and CBO partners.",

On the community capacity side, our metrics for success would involve establishing our first membership-based board of directors with at least three (3) members directly from the community, all of which would involve at minimum four (4) community visioning sessions and placemaking charette events. The goal of this activity is to engage community members, stakeholders, and partners in a collaborative process to envision and shape the future development and use of land within the community land trust, such as housing, public spaces, and amenities within the Chinatown community. This process will result in a collaborative stakeholder structure with our multi-ethnic and intergenerational community members and nonprofit partners to advocate for and/or participate as part of our organization.",

The affordable housing stock is decreasing as residents are forced out and properties are sold to corporations and redeveloped as market-rate housing. Over the past decade, at least 11 new developments have been completed or are in the planning/construction phase in LA Chinatown. Yet, of these 3,027 units, only 215 will be set aside as \"affordable\". In this case, what is affordable is based on the median regional income, which is more than three times what the working class, long-term residents of Chinatown earn. Corporate landlords are eager to make money and evict their working class tenants and while many have been fighting to remain in their homes with the support of local housing justice groups like Chinatown Community for Equitable Development (CCED), fighting against evictions is just one piece of the puzzle."

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Cyber-Seniors envisions a comprehensive system whereby older adults are not only provided with educational resources covering the LA Transit system, but also receive the necessary tech training that enables them to use Metro's existing virtual services. This program will result in more older adults being able to access all LA Metro's virtual tools, designed specifically to remove the barriers older adults may face when accessing transit services. Being able to use the TAP app will result in even higher ridership amongst older adults, as using it provides discounted fares for those aged 62+. Cyber-Seniors' Metro-specific resources will combine with our general, free, tech training services and an all-encompassing outreach project to increase the technological proficiency of hundreds of older adults. Using our partnerships in LA, this project will be scaled for long-term sustainability and success.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Cyber-Seniors' is looking to build off of the ongoing and previous success that we have achieved in Los Angeles. Through our work in the CHAT program, Cyber-Seniors has been able to work directly with over 500 older adults, providing IPad training and helping them feel safe, secure and comfortable using the Internet. In 2022, we were able to work alongside the LA Metro to create custom webinar content covering their transit apps: TAP LA, Metro Micro and Transit Watch. Cyber-Seniors will create an expanded hybrid-presentation series covering topics such as the TAP LA app, utilizing transit apps, virtual bus and rail tours exploring common routes, and a web presentation of the new Regional Connector Project. Cyber-Seniors' plans to work with Los Angeles-based volunteers to create this content, drawing from Cyber-Seniors' existing volunteer network as well as working with local high schools, youth organizations, and colleges to draw in new volunteers. These presentations will be available virtually in webinar format and will also be presented in-person by our Cyber-Seniors staff, in collaboration with the LA Metro and their volunteer teams. Cyber-Seniors' wants to ensure this program is accessible to older adults who may not be comfortable using the internet and technology. To address this, Cyber-Seniors' will run a large-scale outreach program, including taking out ads in neighbourhood newspapers, to promote the series and Cyber-Seniors' free tech training services."

Our mobile case management model is unique-we meet youth wherever they are in the community to facilitate connection and remove logistical barriers that may impede receiving support. 2 core programs: C/HOPE supports justice-system impacted youth by assigning each a case manager who provides ongoing mobile case management. Youth receive assistance with a variety of academic, employment, legal, health and advocacy support and ongoing enrichment opportunities (life skills classes, leadership development, prosocial enrichment activities and field trips including chances to experience nature, wellness courses, and civic engagement service days). C/FORWARD, for former and current foster care youth, focuses on ensuring youth are developing their skills, finding sustainable employment, applying to and enrolling in college, and are living in safe and stable housing. In 2018, in response to increasing housing instability, C/FORWARD began co-operating a 12-unit apartment for emancipated young women. Wraparound services include healthcare linkages, college prep and placement support, financial education, sustainability planning, and participation in academic and life skills education, and prosocial enrichment workshops and events.",

Our management team evaluates program operations quarterly against program objectives. Based on our comprehensive program data, 82% of justice-impacted youth who participate in our programs will not recidivate, compared to 24% youth who will not recidivate in the general community within three years. For our foster youth, 90% of seniors graduate from high school, 90% of these seniors enroll in college, and 50% of these youth are also employed (full- or part-time).

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The pandemic has intensified every inequity for systems-impacted transition-age youth (TAY) to crisis levels. These youth - especially youth of color - often experience significant exposure to interpersonal and community violence, trauma from neglect, domestic violence, and/or physical or sexual abuse, and are at higher-risk for underemployment, major disparities in health outcomes, poverty, homelessness, and recidivism. Roughly 8% of L.A. County youth are Black, yet Black youth represent around 36% of incarcerated youth. They are 6.5 times more likely, and Latinx youth are twice as likely, to be arrested than white youth. According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, one in four foster TAY are unhoused; one in five are incarcerated; one in four became parents; and just 57% are employed. Compounding the vulnerability conferred by their early life challenges, the juvenile justice and foster care systems do not adequately prepare TAY for school, career, or a self-sufficient adulthood.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA2050's investment will ensure that the systems-impacted youth we empower are given rich opportunities and robust support through our mobile case management, prosocial activities, life skills and career-readiness training opportunities to excel academically, professionally and in life. Funding increases our capacity to deepen relationships with existing partners and advocacy groups including Project Rebound, Mayor's Office, LA Youth Uprising, Reimagine LA, Homeboy Art Academy, Trauma Prevention Initiative, LA County Dept. of Youth Development, Probation Department, DMH, and form new strategic partnerships that will expand our ability to empower systems-impacted youth throughout L.A. County. Our decades of experience have proven that exposure to nature and cultural activities are remarkably effective in reaching systems-impacted youth. Funding will be utilized to provide youth with year-round field trips to the beach, surfing lessons, hiking in parks, museum visits, camping, etc."

Last year, YVR helped former foster youth produce and publish 140 op-eds and other written pieces, and worked with young people to host 10 different webinars, which drew more than 2,000 attendees. Our plan to accomplish these activities over the next year are: * Hire a full-time program assistant on the ground in Los Angeles County to reach out to potential partners and youth. * Host workshops with local partners to train youth on op-ed writing and communication skills, for which youth are paid for their participation and compensated when their work is published. * Hire Los Angeles-based Youth Voice Contributors to participate in a 6-month journalism training program. * Provide support for our annual backpack drive for college-bound youth in foster care. * Support our current LA County-based YVR team, including our program manager Raquel Wilson who is a former LA County-systems impacted youth herself (currently residing in Lancaster, one of LA County's communities with youth the least connected to services). * Edit and publish pieces about local policy challenges from current and former foster/justice-involved youth in Los Angeles County. Because LA County youth involved in these systems are almost 90% children and youth of color, we would expect our YVR participants to be representative of this population.",

We envision the youth who experience these systems having the opportunity to share their experiences, thoughts and concerns in meaningful ways that reach decision makers. Fostering Media Connections' Youth Voices Rising program lifts up the stories from these young people to the very people who can make a difference in their lives and ultimately in these systems. One of our 2022 YVR trainings engaged all members of the L.A. County Youth Commission, which was formed to provide youth real oversight and influence in discussions around child welfare and youth justice in California's largest metropolis. These yielded powerful op-eds produced by commission members that appeared in both The Imprint and Knock LA, a prominent watchdog news outlet in the county.

We do this through publishing daily news stories, resources for foster families and elevating youth voice throughout our publications. If we are successful in the plan we propose here, many more of the county's current and former foster youth will have developed the writing and communications skills essential to ensuring that their voice is heard by the public. The work of these young writers and thinkers will have been featured in The Imprint and Fostering Families Today, along with other partnering media outlets. We will have ensured that no policymaker in Los Angeles can credibly say that they are unaware of the views of those with lived experience in the county's foster care system.",

We offer hybrid tutoring (in person and virtual), mentoring, case management & after-school activities such as Life Skills workshops, STEM/Robotics exposure, financial literacy, career development & on the job training. Our youth receive quality tutoring & mentoring through our partnership with USC Viterbi STEM Center and USC Rossier School of Ed masters program. LA, Inc. serves youth throughout LA County, including all areas with low educational attainment, limited resources, high crime, and gang activity. We have service provider contracts with LA County Probation Dept, CalFresh & are vendors for Dept of Children & Family Services. One unique aspect of our program is that in tandem with V.A.L.E., our proprietary high-tech patent-pending software, eLockbox, supports electronically maintaining VLR. As it is integrated with Salesforce.com, worlds #1 CRM tool, it allows seamless data input for demographics & assessment reports, case management duties with easier communication for referrals to needed resources and services.

We are currently contracted with Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) which gives LA, Inc. access to over 725,000 students. Our long-term goal is to hire more staff to increase the number of schools to provide V.A.L.E. to an unduplicated min of 300 F&SIY annually for the next 3 years.

As this is a compelling issue, studies show the national average that completes high school is 49%, 3% enroll in college & 1% graduate from college. A disproportionately low number enter careers and/or entrepreneurial opportunities after they leave the system upon becoming adults. In LA, Inc.'s 30 years of experience, while having contracts with the child welfare & juvenile justice systems, we found the negative statistics are largely due to the transient nature of these youth & their VLR are often misplaced, stolen or lost. They lack the basic tools to navigate within society which prevents them access to benefits in which they have been awarded such as education, medical care, social services, employment, housing & other essential means of becoming productive citizens. This increases the cycle of homelessness, incarceration, & dependence on the welfare system, ultimately affecting their success.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We use several approaches to measure & quantify outcomes. We administer pre & post-assessments 3x over the year: immediately after youth are enrolled, in the middle & at the end of the academic year. Youth receive questionnaires that ask about their attitudes/beliefs & increase/decrease in services, outcomes & behavioral problems. Data is analyzed for outcomes. Other data collection includes a review of report cards, transcripts, attendance records, service contact logs & referrals for disciplinary problems. Our data shows evidence that 87% of our youth graduate from high school on time, 10% enroll in college & 7% graduate from college compared to the national average stated above. Our goal is sustainable funding for youth to commit for 8 years. This enables us to track specific data relating to the outcomes of youth after they age out of the child welfare system, have an education & have access to their VLR. It is proven that V.A.L.E. reduces the disconnect of services."

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The most important measures of impact for Alcott's programs are the number of clients who are provided mental health & housing services, as well as, the retention rate of clients staying permanently housed, the retention rate of clients avoiding incarceration, the percentage of residents who are moving from temporary housing to permanent housing and the attendance rate for therapy appointments. At least 90% of clients who have been permanently housed through our program continue to be permanently housed over the course of a year with the continuous development of our innovative trauma-informed wrap-around services. Over 80% of Alcott clients assisted with our housing services move from temporary to permanent housing over the course of a year. Lastly, over 85% of clients being supported with justice-involved re-entry services will not return to incarceration. The results of these outcomes are often assessed through surveys and the results from other funder's audits.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "There is not just one reason for houselessness or one solution, but Alcott has found a niche at the intersection of mental health, housing, and justice-involved re-entry. The correlation between mental health and houselessness is particularly evident, as many individuals experiencing homelessness often grapple with mental health. The lack of affordable housing and limited access to mental health services exacerbate these challenges. Consequently, individuals struggling may resort to survival activities, increasing their risk of incarceration. Once incarcerated, individuals with mental health conditions face further difficulties, as correctional facilities often lack adequate mental health resources and rehabilitation programs. Consequently, upon release, individuals are more likely to face challenges in reintegrating into society, increasing the likelihood of homelessness and perpetuating the cycle. This interconnectedness highlights the urgent need for comprehensive strategies.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Currently, Alcott is 90% publicly funding, but public contracts do not typically pay for the full cost of providing services given the fact that in many cases they do not permit paying staff members providing direct services a livable wage & can be restrictive in terms of resources that are offered to program participants. This funding would enable Alcott to expand programs to be able to offer interventions that could make the difference in stabilizing program participants or not and better retention amongst staff. Funding diversity would give Alcott the capacity to provide more effective outreach, pay for sweat equity, provide living wages for all staff (some of which are housing insecure themselves), & build the needed infrastructure to maintain these efforts. The Alcott Center has expanded rapidly over the last five years due to strategic initiatives and at the request of the County of Los Angeles to expand services under particular contracts largely due to our dedication & performance. Alcott has grown to meet that need on the program side, but administrative infrastructure and the capacity to diversify private funding have not grown at the same rate. This funding would be instrumental in building the infrastructure needed to maintain this level of growth that is extraordinarily meeting basic needs for thousands of Angelenos and aims to continue to do so for decades to come until hopefully, one day, there is not as much of a need for our housing & mental health services.",

Alcott anticipates continuing to expand services by exponentially growing the number of community members provided field-based supportive housing services and establishing an unarmed crisis response model that will be able to respond in place of armed law enforcement in order to have mental health professionals deescalate crises. With the strengthening of services provided at the intersection of mental health, supportive housing, and justice-involved re-entry, LA County would look vastly different because there would be more individuals who are able to get the support they need before their challenges become more extensive.",

Independent school students have access to greater networking opportunities (Akbarian, 2022) and have significantly higher test scores (Scully, 2022). Students of color need equitable access and community support to thrive in independent schools and take advantage of the opportunities that will help them achieve their full potential."

Along with economic struggles, there is also a lack of arts-driven spaces to bring forth their creative passions. This year, the Fund conducted a national client survey with Morey Group and discovered that the impact of COVID-19 hit the arts community powerfully, with more than 50% of clients having difficulty finding employment or housing. The cost of housing continues to rise while the average income remains stagnant, leading to residents seeking careers outside the city. The Hollywood Arts Collective was birthed from these needs. The project combines affordable housing with an arts center and allows for entertainment professionals to remain in the city by offering safe, clean and modern affordable housing for professionals, with short commutes to nearby studios and production facilities.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Los Angeles has the largest school police department in the nation. Traditionally handled by school staff, tantrums, skipping class, having markers or nail clippers, smoking, fighting, and other \"disruptions\" are now crimes drawing handcuffs, suspensions, expulsions, and arrests. For many youth, truancy tickets lead to \"at-risk\" profiling into the pipeline. Nationwide, African-American students are disproportionately represented in the school-to-prison pipeline and are 3.5 times more likely than their white classmates to be suspended or expelled, landing them in alternative schools, with punitive measures. Recent studies indicate that girls of color are the fastest-growing population in the pipeline. Power Talk disrupts the school-to-prison pipeline by offering critical intervention practices in under-resourced schools that build youth confidence; challenge unhealthy behaviors; and allow youth to believe in their full potential.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Harambee Ministries is a youth development organization serving young people both in the classroom and during out-of-school time. Our intervention program, \"Power Talk\", is designed to challenge unhealthy belief systems and values in elementary and middle school students. Harambee offers Power Talk at 3 schools during the school day. Students are referred to this program based on their probability of suspension. During the hour-long class, we discuss the growth mindset, the power of affirmations and empathy, and leadership principles that prepare young people for real-world scenarios. Elementary classes are focused on preparing at-risk students to develop security in their identity that teaches them to make decisions that repel negative outside influences; at middle school level, our focus is on intervention. Over the 10-week curriculum, the following subjects are covered- Elementary Power Talk: Power of Gratitude Power of Courage I Am Not My Thoughts Fresh Perspective Growth Mindset Love Dream & Imagine Empathy Storytelling Affirmations Middle School Power Talk Honor Everybody Got Choices Courage Now Vs. Then Abundance Gun Violence 13th Amendment The Power of A Coach Grief Coping Power of Listening Investing in the Real World Power of Affirmation Well-poised to expand our efforts and build on existing school district agreements, Harambee Ministries' next goal with Power Talk is to bring the program to alternative schools, serving whole classrooms of system-impacted youth.",

Power Talk will ensure that our most vulnerable students have a chance at success, not a likelihood of becoming another statistic. Expanding to more schools will allow us to have greater impact throughout Los Angeles as we identify places where students need us the most. Against the backdrop of principles such as the Committee for a Greater LA's No Going Back report, Power Talk addresses anti-Black racism in all its forms; builds an economy that prioritizes those who have been left or kept behind; supports education access for all children & all communities; celebrates & supports youth leadership & empowerment; builds community power & new metrics of success; and aligns business, community, philanthropy, & government for equity.",

The National Risk Index shows historically disadvantaged communities are often the hardest hit by these disasters and experience high rates of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), which can turn into lifelong childhood trauma. While there's been an increase in awareness around children's needs, a historical lack of resources - both financial and operational - means there must be sustained, multi-year pressure upon individuals and institutions in control of these emergency response mechanisms in order to implement systemic change.",

After removal from their traffickers, our clients' needs continue to be many: from urgent needs for safe shelter, clothing, food, and medical attention, to longer-term needs for personal support and care. After initial intervention, our Saving Innocence case managers meet with their clients regularly to provide long-term intensive personal case management, helping them establish a sense of stability as they navigate their journeys to healing.

During exploitation, trafficked youth will experience a range of cruelty and abuse, including regular physical and sexual assault, hunger, forced drug use, emotional manipulation, and developmental delays. Human traffickers are well known for using their victims' vulnerabilities to recruit and then manipulate them into compliance with terrible abuse. Traffickers prey within communities where economic struggle and underinvestment of resources are the norm, and among vulnerable young people, including systems-involved youth (foster care/child welfare & juvenile justice systems). They exploit conditions of poverty, which can cause young people to see themselves as powerless with few options; and social isolation, which feeds yearning for approval and belonging. Without effective intervention, the traumatic cycle of exploitation and abuse begins in childhood and repeats over generations.",

While crisis response & case management remain the core of our work, we continue to grow into program areas that respond to our clients' needs. Recent examples of this responsive growth include the Survivor Leadership Academy for Youth (SLAY) & Growth Group personal development & peer support circles for transition-aged youth; our Foster Family Agency; & the Parent Empowerment Program for parents of youth who have experienced trafficking. We recognize that an effective response to sex trafficking includes changing broken systems, not just treating the wounds those systems inflict. It is our mission to build a more supportive and victim-centered culture within the juvenile justice system here in LA: to help others see survivor youth the way we see them, as resilient, creative, brilliant people full of determination & hope.",

Health researchers determined that as important to direct access to high quality, primary medical care is, that failure to address the social determinants of health affecting our lives leads to fragmented medical care with higher morbidity and mortality rates. AHA's focus on assisting community health centers, clinics and other social service agencies to provide these core enabling services is resulting in more patient continuity with their medical providers, improved clinic visit rates, improved health outcomes and an overall improvement in the daily quality of life for hundreds of low income, minority residents of L.A.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We developed a special expertise with our Care Coordinators Program. We have contractual agreements with Federally Qualified Health Centers, community clinics, social service agencies, churches and small businesses to address these essential enabling services that have been proven to affect and improve overall health care of predominantly low income, minority individuals. Our aim is to foster and improve health outcomes among high risk, high need individuals including the LGBTQ community, the homeless, through increasing access to our Care Coordinators Program. We focus on the most vulnerable patients, low income, uninsured and undocumented minorities who not only must struggle with financial constraints associated with no health insurance coverage but they must also face the cultural, racial and socio-economic barriers impacting them. We witnessed firsthand these barriers during the covid - 19 pandemic. We emerged more determined to reach out to those most in need of our services.",

AHA is measuring its impact by tracking and documenting the number of individual clients served. We have directly assisted more than 350 families who for various reasons including language barriers, were unaware that they qualified for Medi-Cal, Cal Fresh, income tax preparation, social security disability determination, enrollment with the Covered California Health Insurance Program, food distribution programs, utility and or rental assistance programs. While the number of clients served may be small in comparison with publicly funded entities such as the L.A. County Dept of Social Services, the numbers nonetheless document the huge demand and unmet needs for these enabling services found within the multiple urban communities compromising the L.A. metropolitan area."

If we don't empower people in our local community with these skills, their chance of success is severely diminished. More than ever, our underserved communities deserve representation. Black businesses need our help as nearly 50% are destined to close and many Black Americans are becoming entrepreneurs as a matter of necessity. Latinos are the most entrepreneurial group in America. They account for?20% of the U.S. population, and there are over?5 million?Latino-owned businesses in the U.S. According to David J. Smith from the University of Chicago \"all minority groups with elevated rates of crime or incarceration are socially and economically disadvantaged.\" Researcher Joseph Quednau points out that a lack of access to well-paying jobs aggravates the problem.",

And in the midst of helping entrepreneurs, we also empower various community organizations that desperately need to build capacity to help their communities start and grow businesses. Across the US, there are a variety of organizations that support their local communities. More recently, their communities have been turning to them to help with starting and growing their businesses. Unfortunately, these organizations - from Chambers of Commerce to Urban Leagues - lack the capacity to do so. In many of our programs, we can distribute to these organizations licenses to the Learning Community to provide to their members. We measure success through looking at engagement, achieving key business objectives like setting up and raising capital, and comparing current versus past results.",

Currently in LA County there is an average annual income of $76,367. However, among populations of color the average annual income is much less. The overall poverty rate and unemployment rate is 13.9% and 7% respectively. However in populations of color poverty is 16-20% and unemployment is 8-10% according to the last census. In a population over 10,000,000 that is millions of households that would benefit from our program. In the last 5 years we have worked in some of the most impoverished areas in Ohio, Detroit, Dallas, Baltimore, Chicago, and more with great success. By bringing our model here with our team and partners we can bring results to a decades long program by building relationships and providing resources with immediate results.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Our program works by getting feedback from academic professionals like Dr. Samantha Lenkford and Dr. Chico Tillmon, qualitative responses from participants and alumni, cultural implications from partners and ambassadors, and mentors. We are constantly growing and tailoring our program with the impact of what the needs of a community or population need, and building relationships ranging from the local Chambers of Commerce, SBAs, Urban Leagues, and more. This relationship development has helped us work in the individual space of our participants and the larger overall economic development of a community. Our ability to network and champion the voices of the under represented people in our global economic community helps provide social equity and levels the playing field for everyone."

Other topics include self-confidence, self-care, hygiene, etiquette, and other basic social skills that are important for their holistic development. We lead sessions on breaking down trauma and generational trauma, positive role models, issues impacting the LGBTQ+ population, guidance on engaging with law enforcement, and more. We offer mental health support with a specialist who shares common experiences and backgrounds so our youth can identify with them, feel understood, and be comfortable opening up. We also take youth on excursions and field trips to post-secondary educational institutions, local government offices and meetings, networking and engagement events, recreational activities, and more. Our aim is to challenge youth's perceptions of their reality by illuminating the opportunities that exist outside of their built environments and exposing them to social, civic, and cultural experiences that differ from their norms while strengthening core life and coping skills.",

This is a new project that we have been at the forefront of but we are still learning this process as the doula medi-cal benefit just rolled out in 2023. We are working to ensure more BIPOC people become doulas so that they can provide inclusive, advocacy-centered, community-based doula support and visibility. This training will help to increase the doula workforce and meet the need that currently cannot be met for the number of Medi-Cal recipients who will be looking for support from doulas, as thousands of people give birth in LA county every year yet currently there are only about 100 doulas that have been approved by medi-cal. This training will also include information and mentorship to become Medi-Cal providers via PAVE and under our collective as a group provider. It will also make the process more accessible as there are costs and barriers to become a Medi-Cal provider. Our collective supports members with administration, billing, and negotiation to eliminate institutional barriers so that doulas are being paid for their work in a timely fashion. We want to ensure doulas are not overburdened with admin and tech issues and are taking on that responsibility for them.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA county will be different because our work will contribute to changing the current culture of the birth and postpartum where people are unsupported and burdened. BIPOC birthing people will know help is available to them at no cost from a doula through Medi-Cal. In the US, most birth related deaths are preventable, doulas are one tool to help decrease these senseless tragedies. More people will have access to reproductive care for all pregnancy outcomes including abortion and loss. In the short term, we hope to continue to host monthly Medi-Cal trainings, doula trainings, and have systems in place to support more doulas with medi-cal administrative and reimbursement to ultimately help reduce income inequality and increase income stability for more in Los Angeles county. In the long term, we hope to see a drastic decline in maternal and infant health disparities by training more doulas who represent the different people who make up and make LA county.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Black women and infants are dying at disproportionate rates during childbirth and postpartum. Undocumented people and people who do not speak English have difficulties accessing prenatal care. Teen mothers are struggling to find resources and have their parental rights respected in pregnancy, birth, and beyond. We live in one of the richest countries in the world, yet we still have one of the worst maternal health outcomes. Many people are still unaware of doulas and their benefits. However, when pregnant/birthing people work with doulas they report better birthing outcomes, they are less likely to have interventions, and feel more positive about their health experiences. California recognizes the importance of doulas and they are now covered by Medi-Cal. Unfortunately, doula work is still not widely known, and cost of trainings can be inaccessible. Doulas being covered under Medi-Cal will help increase the awareness of the profession and provide economic stability to doulas.",

We have one of the largest diverse group of doulas who have been approved and are already serving the population. Our monthly PAVE trainings have had 20+ people register. Attendees report: they are applying, they have been approved, or they feel more confident, and the training helped them decide to become a Medi-Cal doula. We have also partnered with other community based organizations to increase the number of people who have access to navigating medi-cal and we will continue to with this project. We will continue to implement evaluations post trainings and webinars to gauge impact and needs.

The class expressed specific areas where they required support; understanding credit, acquiring job skills, advancing their careers, gaining financial literacy, realizing their dreams, and making sound decisions. Addressing America's opportunity gap necessitates confronting factors such as race, ethnicity, ZIP code, and socio-economic status.

Outreach Program: This program goes into the community to take our services to the people and increase our visibility in the community, so that people in need of housing can encounter MOHF on their own territory before deciding whether to take advantage of our resources.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We have upgraded our evaluation software to Apricot Core by Bonterra, a case management software that assists us in gathering a wealth of data about our clients, including demographics, progress, and outcomes. Before this upgrade, we kept track of basic demographics and some outcomes data, which showed our programs were producing desired outcomes. We are excited to be in the process of shifting to this upgraded case management software. This increases our capacity to produce detailed reports (for internal and external use) to measure program efficacy through client outcomes and improve programming accordingly. Our Rental Assistance Program in particular is an early-stage program responding to immediate community need. For this program, we expect to see families getting off the street and into safe transitional housing; parents using our employment services to upskill and earn more money to support their families; and families moving on to stable, permanent housing."

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We inspire a love of performing arts in the next generation. We want all who attend, including BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and differently abled students, to leave inspired to create. We've worked towards this by casting BIPOC actors in positions of power, and including more explicitly queer relationships. For example, Hermia and Lysander were both women in last year's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Peter Quince was changed to Petra Quince and used they/them pronouns. We know this program is life changing for students - there are people performing on our stage every season who first encountered Shakespeare taking this field trip as young people. With particular attention to Title 1 schools, offering scholarships and/or transportation support when needed, we will expand our reach and diversity, so that instead of Shakespeare feeling intimidating to students, his works and performing them inspires the next generation of artists, leaders, and changemakers.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "While the works of Shakespeare are required reading across multiple grade levels, the reasons why we study Shakespeare and what worth his plays offer to youth today are often neglected. Additionally, the experience of reading Shakespeare on the page is often alienating and unwelcoming, especially for BIPOC and queer children. What value does this old dead white guy offer them? At Theatricum, we address this through inclusive casting and immersive theatre. Students don't just see a play- they become a part of it. First and foremost, the goal is inclusion. We show students: you belong here, both in the audience and on the stage. This method of expression - theatre, Shakespeare, performance - is for you. A direct quote from a teacher attending a 2023 performance: \"The cast was diverse AND super talented. I loved that any audience member could look on stage and see themselves up there and become more inspired by the performances because they had a deeper, more meaningful connection.\"",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "School Days attendees are diverse K-12 students from every school environment who travel to the theater to take part in workshops and a live performance a full Shakespeare, Classical, or New American play in Theatricum's outdoor amphitheater in Topanga Canyon. 6,619 students and chaperones from 115 schools attended the 24 SD performances in 2019 (23% ES; 51% MS; 34% HS; and 2% Home). Participants include public, private, charter, parochial, magnet, home, continuation, and special needs students from virtually every ethnic, socio-economic and religious background. We partner with every possible resource to bring schools to the theater, expending needs based tuition and bus scholarship funds. We offer flexible programming that can serve virtually every school budget, schedule, population, or venue, addressing accessibility due to geography or economic condition, and disability. Each arts education lesson is presented with access points for all learners including kinesthetic, aural, visual and oral activities. The longest running program of its kind in the region, School Days is offered for 4-6 weeks each spring and 2-3 weeks each fall. With consistency, Theatricum brings students to the highest level of arts education in a breath-takingly beautiful outdoor environment . In our 50th anniversary year, this grant will set us up for the next 50 years of LEARNing and PLAYing with the youth of LA.",

The federal government supports this, see the bipartisan bill H.R.6521 \"Supporting STEM Learning Opportunities Act\". and the 2022 Whitehouse report \"CONVERGENCE EDUCATION: A GUIDE TO TRANSDISCIPLINARY STEM LEARNING AND TEACHING\". We have surveyed high school educators and found some common pain points: No room in the present curriculum to add Invention and Entrepreneurship courses. Funding available for equipment but not for capable people to operate and maintain it. Difficult to include the entire class in these programs Our students have commented: Programs are too rigid with little allowance for creativity. Not enough connection to the real world. Students have extra unstructured time in school. There is a need to provide new approaches and facilities in Los Angeles.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The mission of our program is to help STEAM aware students take the next steps in their experiential journey. With our program we aim to extend school with real world experience for high achieving students to stretch their capabilities and experience activities not possible in their in school settings. We will develop Invention Student Incubators with Minds and Hands on real world activities - Learning engineering concepts - Identifying problems to solve - Creating technical prototypes - Entrepreneurship activities - Raising money to develop a product - Launching the Product - Selling the product. Imagine an Invention Student Incubator consisting of an open work area, creative design room, a machine shop and a digital fabrication room. Staffed by volunteers and paid teachers and technicians. A place where students from various schools, geographical areas and diverse demographics can come together to hone in and expand their STEAM skills. This will be an incubator of people rather than just products. We expect to produce highly trained and experienced individuals ready to enter the tech workforce or enroll in the top universities to continue their education. This is the best solution to develop our homegrown STEM workforce, it is local, highly technical, accessible to all and a long term experiential learning environment. The program may create the future leaders of tomorrow and indirectly impact millions in LA as well as the rest of the state and nation.",

We have received awards in competitive robotics, secured student grants from MIT, and obtained patents. In order to widen our impact, including more high school students. We are seeking funding to establish a multi-year product development program and incubator space to empower students to become inventors and entrepreneurs. We will measure success using real world results: number of products developed, funds raised, patents granted, college admissions and jobs for our students. We are collaborating with the Lemelson MIT invent program to provide curriculum and conduct academic research on the efficacy of our project. This will enable us to enhance our program and accurately quantify our results."

Longer term, the school transformations will benefit an under-resourced, densely populated, park-deficient neighborhood of 85,000 residents, serving as a model for schoolyard transformations across the county. Greening will provide vital park access, support healthy learning environments, and combat heat islands. It will encourage learning, play and provide a respite from the dense, hardscape surroundings. Trees will shade and lower air temperatures. Increased shading also lowers energy use and associated GHG emissions and absorbs air pollutants, contributing to improved local air quality. Increased tree canopy, permeable surfaces, and high efficiency irrigation will reduce flooding and stormwater runoff.",

These spaces are designed in collaboration with school districts, educators, parents, children, and community members to ensure their needs are centered. Work at these sites has improved community environmental resilience, access to green space, and opportunities for learning and play. TPL measures project success based on improvements in park equity and access, specifically, the number and demographics of people residing within a 10-minute walk of their projects. Their multi-method evaluation process relies on the collection of quantitative and qualitative data collected from GIS tools, direct observation, tracking, surveying, and design calculations. Data is collected before and after each park is built to help the team fully understand the many benefits.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "During the grant period, Heal the Bay Aquarium will train a minimum of 10 new LA Conservation Corps members in aquarium science, experiential education, and environmental conservation. Qualified trainees will be tasked with delivering grade-appropriate marine science curriculum that supports Next Generation Science Standards for a minimum of 1,500 K-12 students attending Title 1 schools during outreach events. Using a mobile aquarium touch tank as a portable classroom, outreach events will run for a duration of 1.5 to 2 hours onsite at a designated school. Groups of 10-15 students will receive hands-on learning at a time allowing them to connect with ocean animals and engage in lessons about ocean habitats, animal adaptations, food webs, watersheds, and conservation. Groups will rotate every 15-30 minutes, resulting in a total average of 60-100 students per outreach event.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "According to the Lawrence Hall of Science at UC Berkeley and SRI International, 40% of elementary school teachers surveyed in their study responded that their students received 60 minutes or less of science instruction per week. This reality impacts low-income communities of color, formal school settings and is exasperated by a lack of access to informal learning institutions. To help address this trend, Heal the Aquarium seeks to educate hundreds of Los Angeles County-based students (K-12) in the marine sciences in partnership with LA Conservation Corps. While the facility hosts thousands of students annually through its year-round field trip program, the Aquarium is focused on removing barriers for participation by meeting youth \"where they are\" (school sites) to better advance science proficiency and inspire further interest in STEAM.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Heal the Bay Aquarium's program fosters equity and promotes success in K-12 STEAM among underserved students in Los Angeles County. The program's outreach model removes barriers to accessing high-impact marine science education for youth and young adults though its partnership with LA Conservation Corps. Students participate in memorable hands-on activities not available in the classroom setting by bringing Heal the Bay Aquarium to them. As they explore the mobile aquarium touch tank, they develop a better understanding of marine life and respect for nature - the foundation of environmental stewardship. The vision for the program is to dispatch a full team to provide outreach experiences on a regular basis, reaching more schools and students, and increasing student connection through repeat experiences. The Aquarium intends to provide additional science curriculum support and training for classroom teachers to maximize engagement during school-based outreach events.",

Because of the many restrictions placed on them, especially those with a felony conviction, justice involved individuals face many barriers to finding a job or a place to live and accessing government services. A 2018 Prison Policy Institute report found that at least 25% unemployment rate among those formerly incarcerated. The inability to find work contributes to the cycle of recidivism where 2 out of 3 people leaving CA prisons return there within three years. (LA Times 3/2/2023). The common barriers faced include little or no prior work experience, an incomplete or inadequate education, basic and occupation skills gaps, undiagnosed learning difficulties, lack of access to computers and internet, and limited knowledge of how to access help.

People with histories of incarceration or criminal involvement-about 70% of LA's adult unsheltered population-are especially vulnerable because they are also often excluded from housing, employment, and networks of support. This makes it even more difficult for previously-incarcerated people to access the resources necessary to stabilize their lives and take the steps to find safe, permanent housing. What's more, LA lacks adequate sources of clean, cared-for clothing and hygiene resources for people experiencing homelessness, especially for people who are unsheltered. Unhoused individuals often end up wearing old, dirty clothing and facing the stigma of \"looking homeless\" that further marginalizes them from resources, perpetuates a sense of invisibility and shame, and fuels criminalization of people experiencing homelessness.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "It is important to address barriers that result in underutilization of immigrant parents' skills in LA county. According to the LA County Census, immigrants are 33.5% of the population. Immigrant parents often struggle with completing college courses due to limited English proficiency which perpetuates a cycle of limited and missed opportunities for immigrant families. Immigrants make up a major share of workforce operations in industries requiring little formal education. Research from Ballard Brief shows that skilled LEP immigrants earn 25-40% less than their English proficient coworkers, and this income divide is why it is necessary to address this issue. It is imperative to close this gap to allay the generational impact to immigrant children. By supporting immigrant parents in improving English proficiency and building business skills, we can address the income divide and more effectively promote equal opportunities for residents living and working in Los Angeles County.",

Our goal is to reduce this percentage through our program. Immigrant parents would have more access to resources to assist them in pursuing education and diverse career pathways. This would create more stability in households throughout LA County and lead to higher rates of immigrant children pursuing education. This increase in educational opportunities and accessibility will enhance career prospects for people and contribute to the local LA County workforce, assisting in also creating a community that is inclusive and diverse."

Empowerment Conferences are in-person opportunities for youth to be inspired by motivational speakers (many of whom were foster youth and/or are sexual abuse survivors), higher education resources, opportunities for scholarships, entertaining activities, food and giveaways. The events bring together at-risk and foster youth to reinforce Brave's 3 Pillars: 1) Equality and Dignity, \"We see you. You matter.\" 2) Hope and Empowerment, \"We believe in you. You can do it.\" And 3) Inclusion and Mutuality, \"We are with you. You belong.\" An LA County Coordinator will support the expansion of programmatic oversight to the LA region, as well as the services initiated at the event. At the conference, each youth receives one of our key tools for success, an interactive Brave Journal, written by women who endured and overcame difficult circumstances such as foster care, sexual abuse, and the juvenile justice system. They focus on identity, self-worth, healthy relationships, boundaries, and mental health through reflection activities, exercises, and empowering affirmations.

Brave seeks to cast a spotlight into society's shadows, where young people who have become normalized to neglect and exploitation are now motivated and restored to take power over their own futures. This can only be done through a well-coordinated community of care. Brave works to align positive resources to help youth gain stability, self-esteem, and life skills to live independently (post foster care) and feel empowered to fend off negative influences. Brave seeks to rally these voices by expanding into South Los Angeles collaborating with parents, caregivers, teachers, service providers and local churches to give power back to the youth who have grown up with little say over their futures and empower them to be Brave for themselves and their communities.",

Brave measures its success with pre- and post-program surveys of youth to identify improvements in a variety of areas. On a qualitative scale, Brave also collects stories and quotes from youth and caregiver attendees to measure the impact on the lives of the youth served. A caregiver at a recent conference stated, \"It was our pleasure being at the Brave event. That is a memory all the ladies and I will have for a lifetime.

They choose their own classes (like Truth, Lies, and Logic; Mysterious Patterns; and Astronomy), solve math puzzles on teams as part of relays, and work together to solve 100 challenging problems (and win prizes). Students also do fun activities like soccer, chess, and origami. Many students tell us it is the first time they've been challenged in math. Discovery students can apply to BEAM Summer Away, a 3-week residential summer program on a college campus for 40 rising 8th graders. At Summer Away, students do advanced math that others might not study until college (like number theory or combinatorics) and build lifelong friendships. They do 7 hours of math a day, take field trips, talk with mathematicians, and even learn to do their own laundry. For many students, it's their first time away from home. It's a critical exposure to advanced mathematics that allows students to envision a future in STEM. Our programs are free to students."

While more than 70% of jobs require a college degree, low-income students are less likely to persist and graduate. Further, today's graduates need more than a degree to secure well-paying jobs; \"soft skills\" such as critical thinking, effective communication, leadership, and professionalism are important factors in hiring. Yet, low-income students do not have ready exposure or training in their families/communities to successfully secure or succeed in those first jobs-they are unaware of the skills needed to compete and lack access to networks that can help them reach their highest potential. Without proper guidance, starting in high school and continuing through college, to pursue careers that lead to economic mobility, low-income students risk becoming un-or under-employed while also contending with college debt.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Fulfillment Fund remains the largest nonprofit in L.A. providing college access opportunities for high schoolers AND sticking with them throughout college to ensure they graduate and embark on a successful career path.

Last year 93% of our high school seniors graduated vs. 81% for LAUSD overall; 88% of our high school graduates enrolled in post-secondary programs; and 95% of our college students continued to persist toward or graduate with their chosen degree. While incredibly valuable, a college degree only nudges the door open. To truly achieve sustained economic mobility, low-income students need more intensive support to help them successfully transition from school into meaningful careers. Grant funding will allow us to deepen our impact by enhancing and expanding our Career Readiness programming which currently includes a Career Speaker Series (featuring professionals from a variety of fields), Career Expo (career field workshops and structured networking opportunities), skills workshops (resume writing, interviewing, etc.), and connections to exclusive jobs/paid internships offered at no cost to high school and college students.

This is especially true behind the camera (a large part of LA's creative economy) where only 17% of directors and 12% of writers are people of color. One of the first steps to securing a career is by offering real-life examples of what that professional pathway can look like. By connecting underrepresented people in the creative arts with high school students, PLUS ME will help inspire a new generation who more accurately represent the diversity of our county.

We hope to continue to improve upon this trend by connecting students from underrepresented backgrounds to those who have \"made it'' in this competitive field. Shifting culture is a small but essential aspect of addressing systemic inequity. That would mean a flourishing of stories, experiences, and artworks that more fully represent the variety of experiences and perspectives across LA County and beyond. This work feels especially important as the creative fields in our county have reach far beyond Los Angeles, through avenues like Hollywood and the fact that we are the second largest city in the United States.",

Students receive a virtual survey (shared through their teachers) after completing both the guest speaker presentations and in-depth Q&A. On a scale of 1-5, surveys will measure the quality of the presentation overall (was it engaging?), relevance of the story shared, and whether each student is more inspired to enter the creative arts. Open-ended answers will gather any remaining questions students may have and general feedback for the program. We will also collect survey data from guest speaker volunteers to assess the general experience building and delivering their stories, suggestions for adjusting the program, and memorable highlights of connection with students."

It is not surprising then, that just 56% of foster youth earn their high school diploma and only 2% will ever earn a college degree. Despite the systemic failures, CYFC is unapologetically optimistic. We have proven that it is absolutely possible to transform the outcomes of foster youth through education. CYFC has scaled its A.R.I.S.S.E. program model from one school in one district to 65 schools in seven districts.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Inner city youth often walk to school through marginalized neighborhoods that suffer from a high proportion of pedestrian-automobile accidents. Previous cityLAB research in Westlake-MacArthur Park suggests that in doing so they navigate unsafe sidewalks along heavily trafficked streets. According to thirty student surveys and route-mapping exercises, along with eight in-depth walking audits, the students who make these trips are concerned about lack of shade, broken sidewalks, unattractive fences, neglected streetscapes, trash buildup, and poor lighting. Per LADOT's Safe Routes to School program, four of LA's ten most in-need schools are in the neighborhood. The issues measured by cityLAB research and voiced by youth in Westlake-MacArthur Park are clear, as is the need to target particular pedestrian routes around schools. Micro-urban interventions can address young students' stated concerns, improve the pedestrian experience, and create safer and more inviting streets for everyone.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This pilot project builds on cityLAB's previous research which provides valuable insights into heavily trafficked walking routes. Student surveys, interviews, walking audits, photovoice, and mapping exercises of the area point to the sidewalks where Micro-urban interventions can greatly improve youth mobility. Once this pilot project is installed, we can employ the same approaches to survey people who walk along the newly improved route. The success of our interventions will be evident when pedestrians not only acknowledge and appreciate the changes, but also express an increased sense of safety. We want to keep the voices of the students involved at the forefront throughout the process. Ideally, their positive response will extend beyond the immediate area, prompting suggestions to implement similar interventions in other neighborhoods as well."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "While in foster care, youth are moved from one foster home to another and from one school to another, and these repeated displacements interrupt their educational progress and limit the ability to build skills for living independently. Foster youth encounter barriers to success including dropping out of school, unemployment, early pregnancy, and incarceration, and given that 50% experience homelessness after leaving care, it is clear that providing temporary shelter without support to develop skills for long-term independence does not solve chronic poverty. A rapidly changing economic environment makes addressing these disparities and providing pathways to a living-wage particularly urgent. Lower-skill jobs that don't require a post-secondary degree or credential have shifted with increasing automation, and between 2014 and 2024 nearly half of?all?job openings will be middle-skill jobs which require more than a high school diploma but less than a four-year degree.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Since inception, First Place has incorporated evaluation into our program model, ensuring our approach is grounded in data and evidence. Our customized performance management?database allows us to monitor and evaluate the efficacy of specific interventions, determine the best approach for each youth, and make real-time improvements to our programs.?Our recently launched Youth Roadmap Tool uses data science to generate individualized plans of recommended services and milestones for each young person we serve, and the impact of our services is demonstrated by the critical milestones youth reach while in our program. Last year in Los Angeles County, we served 218 young people who achieved?the following positive outcomes:?91% of youth exited into safe and stable housing; 94% of youth who did not have a high school diploma received theirs or made significant progress towards this goal;?84% of eligible youth successfully enrolled in postsecondary education;?80% of youth obtained employment.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles County is home to one-third of California's foster youth - our ultimate vision for these young people is to have?equitable?access to an?ecosystem of education, employment, healthy living,?and housing opportunities necessary for transitioning into?thriving, independent adults. Individualized support solutions provided through Steps to Success, which includes comprehensive education and employment services, have proven to significantly alter the trajectory of a young person's life by providing the resources and relationships to become self-sufficient. This intentional approach aims to prepare youth for the workforce, increase youth's competitiveness in the labor market, and progress towards family-sustaining job opportunities. The program ensures youth receive the necessary training to be competitive in the job market while connecting them to opportunities to earn a living wage.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "First Place's Steps to Success Education & Employment Program supports foster youth?with?career-focused programming to?help them gain the fundamental skills needed to compete in a growing job market and realize long-term self-sufficiency. The program addresses the systemic barriers that have often prevented foster youth from achieving meaningful economic mobility. After first stabilizing youth with safe housing, they are paired with an Education & Employment Specialist and Social Worker to develop personalized career goals and receive support in receiving their high school diploma, enrolling in and navigating postsecondary education, and building job readiness skills such as resume creation and job interview techniques. First Place recognizes that in today's changing economic climate we must refine our program model to ensure we are preparing young people to move beyond their first jobs and succeed in family-sustaining careers, and therefore have introduced the evidence-based Apprenticeship Model which serves as an alternative option to the traditional AA/BA postsecondary education. The model connects youth with opportunities in high growth career sectors and promotes youth progress through?on-the-job-training, career-focused education, industry-recognized credentials, and employment skills."

Once built, the Park will serve as an anti-pollution green buffer to reduce the impact of air pollution from the Interstate-10 Highway adjacent to Ramona Gardens. Legacy LA youth began this campaign by conducting environmental studies on air quality (2016); and conceptualizing a Natural Park to mitigate air pollution. Youth engaged 500 community residents, who provided input on park design. The Park campaign is now in the design development phase including obtaining environmental clearances. Advocacy efforts will focus on raising funds needed to begin construction. With the LA2050 grant, Legacy LA will continue to advance the Park campaign while also educating youth on the necessary skills needed to gain an entry level position in the parks/conservation industry. We will provide 45 youth with 80 hours of career readiness, leadership, and environmental justice training over 10 months including (a) 30 workshops on leadership, environmental justice, and how to engage stakeholders, and elected officials in natural park advocacy efforts; and (b) Career Readiness trainings/outings and exposure to various careers through Annual Legacy LA Career Week event (c) Youth will update residents on the Park campaign through Youth Leaders in Action meetings and events including a culminating town hall meeting for community, elected officials, and environmental justice organizations.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Air quality in Ramona Gardens (in northern Boyle Heights) is among the worst statewide, according to a CalEnviroScreen map, due to transit pollution. The 15-lane Interstate-10 Highway, El Monte busway, and Metrolink rail line are immediately adjacent to Ramona Gardens. Per US Census data, 37.7% of families in the area have income below poverty & 86.5% of residents identify as Latino (zip code 90033, census tracts 2031 and 2033). In comparison, those figures are 14.3% and 48.2%, respectively, countywide. In addition, at-promise youth from our community have historically had a lack of entry level employment opportunities where they can gain the skills and education needed to pursue long term employment. This has perpetuated a cycle of poverty that leads to potential gang involvement, drug use, and little opportunity for upward mobility. Often such barriers mean youth are less likely to explore their local natural and cultural resources. This project will address these root issues.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Legacy LA measures impact at the community and individual level. At the community level, youth leaders conceptualized the Natural Park campaign and successfully outreached to over 900 community members through events and surveys to gather input on park design. As a result, the community now has a resident-driven design for a Natural Park including features that will reduce air pollution, increase green space, and provide job opportunities. At the individual level, Legacy LA has trained 40-60 youth/year in leadership skills and environmental justice over the past three years. In 2022-2023, 95% of youth agreed \"I have learned about the benefits of the Natural Park Anti-Pollution Solution\". We also plan to conduct pre- and post-participation written tests, as well as a self-evaluation form, for all youth clients. This will allow us to gauge both the effectiveness of the program and the retention of information provided during training, career readiness, advocacy and education sessions.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The proposed project will advance environmental justice in a low-income primarily Latino community in Boyle Heights. Key project outcomes will be enhanced community capacity to address emerging environmental justice issues, promoting youth participation in civic life and local decision-making to help advance the campaign for the Natural Park. The career readiness trainings and outings will raise awareness of the economic opportunity presented by careers in the environmental justice field, teach the youth valuable/marketable job skills, and increase the community's exposure to natural and cultural resources so that they can pass this knowledge on to their community during Natural Park advocacy efforts and within programming. Once built the Natural park will help protect 2,000 low income, primarily Latino residents from chronic health conditions due to transit-related air pollution, while providing jobs, green space for play and fitness, restoring native habitat, and recycling stormwater",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The grant will support an expanded 'Citizenship Education and Empowerment Program,' aimed at full immersion in the three subjects of the Naturalization Test: reading, writing, and understanding civics concepts. The program is meticulously designed in both English and Spanish to cater to the linguistic needs of a diverse group of Legal Permanent Residents. Through interactive and participative methods, we create an engaging learning environment that builds essential language skills and a deep understanding of American government and history. Additionally, the grant will enable us to widen our support, reaching out to a larger audience and providing more personalized assistance in filling out citizenship applications. Our approach ensures that language barriers and complexities of the citizenship process are no longer insurmountable obstacles, paving the way for confident and informed aspiring citizens.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If our work is successful, Los Angeles County will witness a transformative change in the accessibility and quality of citizenship education for Legal Permanent Residents. By conducting in-person events at various locations across the county, we will foster a community-centric approach to learning and support. The increased availability of online webinars and Zoom events will ensure that individuals, regardless of their location, can access vital resources and education. Additionally, we will be able to strengthen collaborative networks with other organizations supporting the community, creating a robust support system. The incorporation of homework and structured learning initiatives will further enhance participants' understanding and retention of critical concepts. Ultimately, this holistic approach will contribute to higher success rates in the naturalization process and an empowered, informed, and inclusive community of new U.S. citizens in Los Angeles County.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Our understanding is that Legal Permanent Residents often face multifaceted challenges in their pursuit of U.S. citizenship, which include language barriers and a lack of comprehension of critical concepts like the U.S. Constitution. Many aspirants struggle with reading and writing in English, which hinders their ability to understand and adequately respond to citizenship test questions. Additionally, the complexity of the citizenship application can be daunting. Our initiative addresses these issues by not only assisting them in filling out the citizenship application with their answers but, more importantly, providing education to build their language skills and a deeper understanding of essential civics concepts. Through personalized assistance and education, we empower them to navigate the citizenship process more confidently and effectively."

Studies show that programs are more effective if students have multiple points of contact with museums. In the pilot of this program at MONA, we witnessed substantial changes in students. Feedback from teachers mentioned the transformative power of the program in their students' lives, noting how this training and collaboration reinvigorated teacher learning. Due to neon's presence outside of museum spaces, this experience infuses student learning outside the museum. The program consists of a teacher pre-visit professional development where approximately 12 teachers and administrators get a tour of the museum and take a neon bending workshop. They receive reading materials, lesson guides, and create a neon artwork to hang in their classroom. Following this, MONA staff visit the teachers' classrooms to facilitate an art making activity, introduce MONA, and provide hands-on demonstrations to frame their future visit to the museum.

Phase 1 of the pilot will entail an individualized biopsychosocial needs assessment, a comprehensive skills and experiences intake, and interest and skills self-evaluations for each participant. Participants will reflect on their qualifications, including previous work and volunteer experiences in peer groups. Each participant will develop an individual employment plan with self-directed employment goals. Phase 2 will focus on employment preparation and tailored referrals to employment, training, or educational opportunities based on participants' individual employment plans. Participants will also attend employment support workshops that cover job application assistance and professional development workshops teaching appropriate workplace communication skills. Phase 3 will monitor employment progress and incorporate peer-led behavioral health support. Participants will continue to meet regularly in peer groups for progress check-ins and to share employment successes and challenges. Peer facilitators will encourage the sharing of coping, emotional regulation, and mindfulness skills to address past and recurring psychosocial traumas affecting employment.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "This pilot will address the current unmet need for employment support in South LA by supporting individuals with a history of systems-involvement who have trouble navigating the LA job landscape and its siloed workforce development initiatives. Our pilot would be the first to integrate employment and behavioral health support within a peer-group environment in a trusted community-based setting in South LA. Overall, given the success of this model in improving employment outcomes per literature review, the therapeutic benefits of peer support groups for mental health, and the demand for such a program by both the ISLAH LA community and its leadership, this intervention holds great promise for addressing employment and mental health disparities among systems-involved adults in South LA. To scale this pilot, further funding opportunities could be explored through MediCal coverage via the CalAIM Justice-Involved Initiative, which covers re-entry community-based care coordination."

When Angelenos lost financial security, healthcare and housing during the pandemic, the burden on direct service staff, clergy and lay-leaders to help grew in unprecedented ways, too. The work is sensitive and complex yet largely low-paying. Frontline staff are often recent college graduates or drawn to the work due to lived experience of homelessness. Despite offering trauma-informed care and experiencing the rewards of impactful work, frontline staff in LA County share worries of stress, trauma, fatigue and burnout. In fact, frontline staff in homeless services are leaving the field at an alarming rate. This not only negatively affects the individual, it also disadvantages agencies and clients. Clergy are defacto frontline workers, coming face to face with folks they are not fully equipped to help and risking similar trauma and burnout.",

Trainings raise the baseline of crucial knowledge as we work together to help our neighbors become housed with dignity. They teach lay leaders essentials to compassionate outreach and public safety. We find workshops effective in meeting this gap in service, with high demand and widely reported positive personal outcomes. In response to the high level of demand we couldn't meet over the past two years, WC will expand our highly successful trainings for frontline staff members, whose work has a ripple effect among those they serve directly and their communities and for members of the faith community. A more robust and resilient social service network supports long-term sector growth, greater consistency within agencies and faith among clients, and builds hope in neighborhoods.",

In the long term, foster youth served by the project will reap the benefits of improved transition planning and a positive educational experience translating into future economic security. This project will also develop LRLC's connections to foster youth in need of educational advocacy and bolster the network of organizations dedicated to empowering these youth. LRLC will have tangible education rights resources for use in the future and partnerships with referring agencies to better serve foster youth in Los Angeles County.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Foster youth ages 14 to 17 are at a pivotal point in their life trajectory. These students require a strong educational foundation and network of support to ease the transition to adulthood. These requirements are not guaranteed for older foster youth, who may experience placement instability and lose their connections to supportive adults. Youth moving between schools can likewise lose supportive education services or accommodations - critical needs for the 30-50% of foster youth with disabilities. Foster youth need guidance and post-education support, but school transition plans are often minimal. Without an effective transition plan or a supportive education environment, students face severe challenges to obtaining employment or post-secondary education and risk experiencing homelessness or incarceration. It is vital to engage foster youth in their education rights as early as possible so they can enact change in their education environment and take control of their early adulthood.",

Sages & Seekers addresses the social isolation, alienation, loneliness, depression, anxiety and other debilitating issues experienced by high school-aged youth (Seekers) through meaningful connection, dialogue and emotional processing with trusted older adults familiar with navigating these issues - elders (Sages). Human beings evolved to live in small clans, intimately cohabitating with generations of ancestors and descendants. This model has been outmoded in the west by urbanization. But even temporary co-existence can lead to longterm transformation. Because age-segregation is promoted today with retirement communities for older adults, our youth are missing a huge opportunity to learn, grow and create relationships with members of society who can pass on their hard earned lessons including surviving failures, the stress of war, poverty and what it is to be a resilient human.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our free evidence-based 8-Week Intergenerational Program is a one-to-one initiative centered around weekly meetings during a school semester. Our curriculum explores issues in older and younger people's lives, building community, addressing isolation, increasing empathy, and strengthening communication skills. The overall structure of the curriculum is significant and intentional, based on the human condition we all share. Because the weekly meetings build on each other, participant trust grows as the mutual relationship builds, creating a more profound result. Our matched dyads explore commonalities, helping to lift up and support each other's lives and foster reciprocal understanding while creating community among all participants. This program begins each session with a series of powerful discussion questions on topics of being human, such as integrity, human behavior, emotions, communication, and many others. Questions during Week 1 are designed to shatter stereotypes and assist participants in getting to know each other's worlds. Week2: Each Sage is matched with a Seeker in a takeoff on speed dating. Week3-6: Older and younger participants work one-on-one get to know each other. In addition, each session starts with rotation to assure everyone spends time as a community. Week7: Each Seeker writes and reads a Tribute honoring their Sage (bringing value), describing the impact derived from shared conversations. Week8: Debriefing by participants of the impact received.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Running free Intergenerational Programs since 2009, we make a positive, meaningful impact in the lives of two important populations who sometimes feel forgotten and under-valued. The main objective of Sages & Seekers is to address these concerns in the Los Angeles area, recognizing members of both groups can be positively changed by a thoughtful intergenerational experience. Based on the number of schools and senior facilities that have seen a positive shift in school culture and continued participant involvement, we intend to expand our programming to more schools and facilities so we are able to strengthen communities across Los Angeles. More programs means we are able to reduce loneliness, reported as being an epidemic by the CDC. Social isolation is associated with about a 50% increased risk of dementia and other serious medical conditions. Connecting these 2 age groups lowers the risk of of depression, anxiety, and suicide for all participants, while strengthening our communities.",

Study outcomes include 1)greater sense of purpose; 2)greater interest in civic engagement; 3)improved social-emotional skills; 4)reflection on core values; 5)greater well-being. We continue to build on these findings by delivering a post-program survey to all participants measuring more aspects of the mental health crisis for teens, and the post-covid actions and beliefs of our older adults, as well as their mental and emotional needs and feelings.

This results in $700,000 - $950,000 in tax refunds. On average, we support 350 counts of Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), resulting in refunds of $350,000 - $400,000. The EITC is designed by the federal government to get support to the low income families who need it the most. This project will allow us to scale up our VITA efforts by another 20-30% through additional staffing to open multiple locations. The VITA program will support a taxpayer through the entire tax preparation process, from document collection, to reading the tax return, understanding their refunds or owed taxes, payment methods, refund tracking, accessing the IRS website, and a wide variety of tax credit related education. By filing their taxes, many times this results in one of the largest checks for a low-to-moderate income family for the year. Integrating financial coaching during the refund process allows families to set their own financial SMART goals and work with a coach to customize their own game plan and strategy to get there.

What we don't always get to see is where these young people land. We are aware that the odds are against them, despite the very best efforts of the collective \"village\" of non-profits standing by to support. We occasionally hear back from alumni who have suddenly found themselves living in their cars, out of work, or not able to balance parenting and school. We are an organization which prides itself on the personal attention we provide youth. We recognize that with little or no family support, youth exiting systems need focused support longer than many estimate, and guided pathways forward. Without this customized connection, many young people enter the workforce or higher education and an unacceptable number experience hardships too difficult to surmount alone.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "\"Launched in L.A.\" is an expansion of Seen&Heard's current \"phase 3\" optional program open to all graduates. Phase 3 is a 10 week, one-on-one multi-modal coaching program. At this time, Phase 3 has little infrastructure to track outcomes besides a detailed intake form and exit survey. Connections to work opportunities or continuing education are made on a case by case basis. We propose a more formalized pathway to opportunities with customizable options that meet a young person at their appropriate stage. With a dedicated case manager and coach for each \"Launched\" client, youth are guided into one of three areas of their choosing: 1. Continued Professional Development (referrals out to other programs) 2. Work Ready (referrals out to county work projects and private sector jobs) 3. Educational (community college and scholarship connections). Leveraging existing county connections for work and school, as well as small business, \"Launched\" is a program with the economic interest of LA and our youth at it's heart. We have a wide range of needs and developmental stages, as such, we want to build a program that is customizable so everyone from a high school junior to a 21 year old single parent has potential to launch in ways that are appropriate for them. Our goal in \"Launched\" is to see that every program participant is set up for success in ways that ensure future economic stability and educational achievement through the added advantage of personal support from a known guide.",

One young person equipped to thrive is a model for others around them. Change doesn't only happen through mass solutions, it also comes slowly though intentional individual work. We've found large-scale programs can sometimes feel impersonal and hard to navigate for our students. With program graduates given the opportunity to continue in stable connection with Seen&Heard, participants in this pilot are confident in our support and more likely to \"launch\" successfully. Positive outcomes ripple out from individuals into families and communities. We may not be able to change systems, but we can give youth we serve the tools and opportunities to change their own life. Through \"Launched in LA\" change will begin on a micro level in our city, with the potential to ripple out to the larger communities they touch."

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University's Wilmer Eye Center analyzed the benefits to children after receiving eye exams and glasses. This controlled study published in the JAMA Ophthalmology Journal, represents the most comprehensive study of school-based glasses provision ever conducted (2021). The study's findings quantified the impact of our program: students who received glasses made gains, on average, equivalent to an additional 2-4 months of learning time. Those in the lowest quartile of test-takers, those with IEPs, and enrolled in Special Education classes made gains equivalent to 4-6 months of learning. Evidence shows a pair of glasses improves academic performance and engagement in the classroom which then, in turn, impacts long-term student outcomes (e.g. graduation, college) and overall educational attainment.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Health Care Access",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "While approximately 25% of children naturally need glasses, over 90% of children do not receive vision care in underserved communities. Families face multiple barriers to accessing vision care including, but not limited to: lack of healthcare literacy regarding the importance of vision care; acute shortages of low-cost optometric practitioners; limited or unavailable transportation for specialized vision care; misunderstandings about costs for exams/ glasses; and parents' inability to take time off from work. Vision To Learn's mobile clinics, staffed by licensed optometrists, bring eye exams and glasses to children at schools and community organizations to address these acute access gaps. Programs operate year-round, with vision services provided to kids attending schools during the school year, and at summer camps, libraries, and Boys and Girls Clubs during the summer months."

Through our program, RightWay signs the Master Lease of scattered apartment sites and rents well-appointed homes for shared living, provides first and last month's rent, and subsidizes a portion of rent for one year while providing youth with intensive mental health support, employment services, and case management. RightWay assists in fully furnishing each apartment to create a warm and welcoming home, while ensuring all basic needs are met. With guidance from financial coaches, youth learn to budget and save the portion of rent that RightWay covers. All program participants receive foundational resources to build financial independence and emotional stability. Each becomes fully immersed in RightWay's trauma-informed job-readiness program Operation Emancipation, designed to target areas critical to foster youths' ability to retain employment and progress toward self-sufficiency.

It allows attendees to share how they have implemented core learnings in their classrooms and how that information is resonating with students so that we can adjust conference offerings in the future. Thanks to our feedback and survey tools, we have seen a direct correlation between faculty who attend MEC and the increase in internship applications from students at these institutions. Furthermore, we use direct feedback from attendees as a way of measuring impact.

On the trails, they learn about good hiking etiquette, native and invasive species, the concept and function of tree \"canopies,\" and the codependent ecosystems they nurture. We frame everything through the lens of Tongva TEK, which makes abstract concepts of \"sustainability\" real through tangible examples of ancient land stewardship practices still evident in Pasadena's natural environments.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "San Gabriel Valley",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We need to cultivate stewards of our natural environments now more than ever. This is a complex concept for urban children to grasp if they've never stepped foot in nature. For many of our students, CIE is the first time they've ever explored the natural wonders that are literally in their own backyards. This outdoor STEAM experience is unique for public school children from urban areas and supports different learning styles, particularly visual and kinesthetic. Additionally, CIE aims to address PUSD's low test scores for 5th-grade science (the first science testing year). CIE stimulates engagement and perceived success in science through art, which can result in long-term, positive outcomes in learning. CIE also aims to undo historical, institutional racism that systematically discouraged people of color from experiencing the great outdoors for generations. A 2021 CNN report cites studies showing that people of color are less likely to participate in outdoor recreation.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "CIE aims to increase 4th graders' visual arts and environmental sciences achievement by presenting innovative lessons integrating state and federal education standards for these subjects and grade levels. The Armory uses pre/post-student assessments and performance rubrics designed by our Teaching Artists to measure changes in student learning and achievement, including art and science assessments. We also assess students' artwork using one of seven evaluative art rubrics containing criteria pertinent to each art project, such as line, shape, color, composition, and overall artistic expression. We ask PUSD classroom teachers to complete an online survey developed through a Columbia University partnership to gather feedback on the program's impact. In the last completed survey, 71% believed our teaching artist successfully integrated visual art with science standards; 90% agreed students made noticeable progress in art skills.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "CIE nurtures environmental stewards from marginalized communities. The program aims to dismantle institutional racism that alienated people of color from connecting with natural environments for generations, which is crucial to fostering a sustainable future for everyone. Through the lens of visual arts, CIE helps meet the needs of students from Pasadena's Title I schools by serving as a foundation for academic advancement in sciences during their middle and high school years, helping them achieve success in STEM-related fields. With over 30 years of feedback from past students, we know CIE has helped many Pasadena residents develop a lifelong love of hiking. Alongside art and environmental science learning, CIE teaches children proper trail etiquette - don't litter or vandalize, stay on the trails, be courteous to other hikers, and leave the wildlife be. Hiking is excellent for physical and mental well-being and doesn't require expensive equipment.",

Our TAYA Program provides a safety net by extending the continuum of care that My Friend's Place has successfully implemented for young people ages 12 to 25 for more than 35 years. Our target population for the TAYA Program is young adults ages 25 -30 who have been accessing services at My Friend's Place, have identified housing as a goal, and are extremely vulnerable to early death if disconnected from services. Our Health and Well-Being Program, which encompasses housing case management, is the primary program in which TAYA are enrolled. Clinical Social Workers assess each young person's psychosocial, emotional, and relational competencies and individualized plan is developed with participants to address goals including recidivism, substance use, mental health and housing needs. Through individualized case management sessions, each participant receives weekly support including: housing navigation, linkage and retention support; Family preservation services; Linkage to substance use services and Narcan; Legal advocacy and Increasing life skills training..

Additionally, adult systems assume life skills competency that many young adults have not yet achieved, especially young people who have emerged from the foster care system and/or come from families and communities of origin experiencing substantial poverty and instability. Because access to many resources, including housing, is prioritized by vulnerability, and the system does not acknowledge many of the unique vulnerabilities of 25 to 30 years old, this population is often not prioritized for housing and other resources in adult systems, leading to an extended period of homelessness, which exposes TAYA to additional trauma.",

Leveraging both youth and adult services, while at the same time, innovating services that have the potential for sector wide impact highlighting the specific needs of individuals in this developmental stage, we envision the TAYA service model to empower a growing number of young people in Los Angeles County as we work to reverse community disconnection among young people experiencing homelessness and prevent the deterioration of their mental and physical health that can lead to early death.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "My Friend's Place has been implementing and refining our TAYA Program for more than 18 months, and, during this time, we have continuously worked to iterate, adapt and modify our approach and program model to have the greatest impact in the lives of the young people we serve. The numerous needs and vulnerabilities of the young adults enrolled in TAYA programming have informed an ongoing, evolving program design and package of service activities. For example, our target population now focuses on young adults who, as a result of their declining physical or mental health, are extremely vulnerable to early death if disconnected from ongoing services. Since implementing our revised TAYA program model, all of the currently enrolled young adults have participated in case management sessions. To date, our TAYA Program has kept 50+ young people ages 26-30 connected and engaged in vital services supporting their journeys toward a permanent exit from homelessness."

To help our students overcome these barriers, we developed a pre-apprenticeship program known as AIM-N-Inspire, which provides training in creative occupations such as animation, interactive gaming, digital video editing, project management, and media production, providing opportunities that would otherwise be inaccessible. We unlock their potential by bridging the learning and technology gap through state-of-the-art training, focusing on technical and soft skills, fostering leadership qualities, and providing one-on-one mentorship with industry professionals who sincerely believe in each student's success. Our youth-centric culture fosters safe and affirming relationships where they can thrive, while our strength-based approach empowers them to use their unique voices and narratives creatively. Last year, California expanded apprenticeship standards to include a path for creative arts, creating an incredible opportunity for Better Youth to powerfully serve our students by expanding our existing pre-apprenticeship program. Our next step is to expand our current programming to include a credentialled apprenticeship track. A successful launch of this expansion includes at least 1-3 apprentices graduating in 2024."

Because of experiences in their home countries, immigrant victims may be more fearful of reporting crimes, interacting with law enforcement, and seeking social services assistance. Cultural beliefs, limited English language proficiency, and cultural/linguistic isolation can further deter immigrants from receiving help in these situations. They have difficulty knowing where to turn for help and trusting others to provide help. Without an advocate that understands their culture, language, experiences, and unique fears/anxieties, immigrant survivors are likely to remain in or return to violent homes as they feel they have no other choice.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "LACLJ provides free complementary legal and social services, and we are the only nonprofit in Los Angeles County using this approach exclusively with survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking. Staff are predominantly Latina and bilingual with fluency in English and Spanish, so legal professionals and case managers provide services from a culturally- and linguistically-appropriate perspective and are able to build trust relationships with clients. Additionally, LACLJ uses trauma-informed approaches to minimize further trauma as survivors pursue legal remedies and community-based support. LACLJ provides family law services for immigrant survivors to help them secure restraining orders, custody and visitation orders to protect minor children, and child and/or spousal support orders that offer a foundation for financial wellbeing. Legal services for immigrant survivors extends to relief through special visas afforded to crime victims that enable them to remain in the U.S. and work here legally so they can build self-sufficiency. Concurrently, LACLJ's case managers engage survivors in developing safety plans and meeting non-legal needs. Case managers help survivors obtain applicable financial benefits and health care coverage/access and connect survivors to community-based resources to meet essential needs such as housing and nutrition. Case managers also provide ongoing emotional support and accompaniment to court or mediation hearings.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Helping immigrant survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking strengthens the Los Angeles community. LACLJ's vision is that of a strong community where families are safe, stable and free from injustice, and our work helps make that vision a reality. When immigrant survivors are relieved of fears/anxieties, physical/emotional trauma and threats of deportation or family separation, they can heal and contribute to the vibrancy of our community. Immigrant survivors are better able to protect and build healthy relationships with their children under legally-binding restraining orders and custody, support and visitation orders. Immigrants who have been isolated will be able to work, pursue their dreams and reunite with family through visas LACLJ helps them obtain. By building self-sufficiency and engaging actively in the community, they will improve quality of life in Los Angeles and help break the cycle of abuse so future generations are less likely to become victims or abusers.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Beloved Community Housing addresses these inequities through a continuum of care that offers a shift from carceral & welfare systems to a holistic, community-driven approach. Beloved partners with systems-impacted girls, trans youth & caregivers to provide safe, stable housing options through expanded kinship & community-care networks while ensuring families are economically resourced through the provision of guaranteed income. We work with licensing agencies to recruit & approve certified community homes that function as formal foster homes hosted by individuals from the community who share identities & experiences with the youth and who receive extensive, ongoing support & training from Beloved. The goal is to resource communities to make self-determined choices about their own lives, to foster economic independence, & to support alternatives to incarceration that are grounded in real housing options & family reunification. Individuals with lived experience are hired as Self-Determination Advocates who work closely with young people & families to build relationships, develop individualized plans, support systems navigation, provide legal advocacy, coordinate housing placement, & access necessary resources & interventions. All Beloved participants are supported for 3 years with restorative justice facilitation, family/relationship support, & annual funding of up to $65,000 per family (compared to $400K per year to house 1 young person in juvenile detention).",

While LA County voted to close juvenile facilities in 2021, the number of incarcerated youth has only increased. Poverty & race are predictors of system involvement, & interaction with one system increases the likelihood of involvement in another: 25% of homeless youth experiencing foster care & 59% navigating the justice system. These statistics show that housing instability & economic precarity form a direct pipeline into legal & child welfare systems which disproportionately impact families of color. Historical solutions have largely ignored the critical roles of economic inclusion & community-led efforts, relying instead on detention & congregate care - responses that increase intergenerational disparities, decrease chances of family reunification & economic mobility, & perpetuate the criminalization of youth & communities of color.",

LA will become the model for ending youth incarceration, eradicating youth homelessness, expanding community-care networks, prioritizing the self-determination of marginalized communities, & fostering economic independence through universal basic income for systems-impacted families. The short-term goals that will lead to this larger vision include: 1) the launch of our 3-year pilot to serve at least 50 young women, trans youth, & their caregivers in LA, 2) strong partnership with our fiscal sponsor YWFC & sibling organization Sister Warriors to advocate for LA County's fulfillment of its commitment to close detention facilities & divert young people into community -based housing, & 3) documentation & evaluation of the process & outcomes towards evolving & scaling the model.",

During the pandemic, YWFC diverted 50 system-impacted youth experiencing housing & economic crises from state-run residential facilities to community-led housing. This program's success has heavily informed Beloved's design. We also rely on YWFC's Research Institute & its long-standing partnership with New York University (NYU) for data collection & evaluation. Previously collected data is already being analyzed by NYU to establish a baseline & to craft feasible, ambitious goals that will demonstrate program success which will be measured by a decrease in the number of systems-involved & homeless youth in LA, an increase in economic mobility & stability of participants compared to the control group, improved well-being of participants & caregivers, & policy change driven by program outcomes."

We partner with local NGOs to facilitate planting, then integrate with brands to tie those trees to their customers through things like online orders. Existing relationships with organizations like Tree People will be used + expanding to other NGOs doing good work that need funding. Once trees are planted, we help message the impact to the end customers that supported these projects by supporting local LA brands.

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In order to partner with Ecodrive, NGOs must implement our verification technology. It's no additional cost to them, but it does mean a commitment to capturing a lot of granular data around the planting process. What that entails is things like: - Planning: understanding where the planting will happen, the goal of the project (reforestation, biodiversity, etc.), engaging local stakeholders, designating plots to plan with polygons outlined using GPS tech -Every planter has a phone/GPS device that captures daily planting session data like lat/long, timestamps, content, and number of trees planted -Monitoring software via satellites, in field tech, and in person monitoring on a regular cadence to measure things like survival rates -We set all this up in our portal so anyone that is involved/supports has access to all the data and content above."

For the youth we serve, this is compounded on top of their already fragile mental health. Transgender/gender-diverse youth are six times more likely to experience suicidal thoughts. Over the past several years, The Laurel Foundation has seen the devastating effects the COVID-19 pandemic along with economic, community, and social disruptions have had on our community. Our programs all have had an astounding increase in camper enrollment, and increased requests from caregivers for help. The Laurel Foundation is a 100% cost-free program. We address these issues by providing a safe space for play and empowerment for the youth.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The impact on Los Angeles County as a result of our program is enormous. Safe play should not be a right given to those who can only afford it. Low-income youth, when empowered, they have hope. They believe in themselves and believe they can make a difference in the world to make it a better place. This hope decreases youth at-risk activities, gang involvement, crimes, etc. Our youth face adversity every day. This leads to mental health challenges and at-risk activities. By empowering them, they do not participate in at-risk activities, as they have hope and want to build a productive life. This then impacts communities. It will impact Los Angeles County, in that there will be few crimes and a foundation of youth in Los Angeles who want to make a difference in the communities they live to make them better.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The Laurel Foundation assesses the impact of its programs in several ways. 1) At each resident program, we have the youth complete our Battery Outcomes Survey. The youth complete an intake survey on the first day and an outtake survey on the last day. The surveys assess growth for independence, self-empowerment, sense of community, productive communication, and self-advocacy. These are charted throughout the participation of the youth in our programs. In some instances, we have tracked youth for over 11 years. This enables us to see the short and long-term effects of our programs. Additionally, we hold annual focus groups with the parents/guardians as well as the youth and do ongoing case management on the youth. This allows us to truly see the effectiveness of our efforts. This allows us to see firsthand the impact of our programs. We measure success one youth at a time, watching how they build productive successful lives.",

To end the crisis, we must meet individual needs for housing, provide the services needed for health and wellbeing, and work to address the systemic causes that lead thousands of people to lose their housing every year. In the process, we must treat people with dignity, recognize the experience of trauma that each person carries, and change the narrative around homelessness.

Our continuum of services meets immediate needs and offers a broad spectrum of support to build long-term stability as households transition from homelessness to housing. Our 6 interim housing sites house approximately 950 individuals annually, 400 of those in families. Key components of our program include: Care coordination from a dedicated Care Manager with a client load of not more than 25 individuals, allowing for the ability to take time with each client for a personalized approach to care. Care Manager availability 24/7 so that support is always available, and a trained resident advisor is available for after hour emergencies.

Moreover, we station staff members outside LAAS shelters, intercepting pet surrenders and offering safe alternatives. Many of the individuals we assist with TNR reach out to us because their neighbors have grown frustrated with the presence of neighborhood cats. Often, a single household has taken responsibility for feeding and caring for a colony, while the rest of the block desires their removal. Our work not only eases tensions among neighbors but also tackles the root issue by ensuring the cats are spayed/neutered, effectively halting their breeding cycle. We firmly believe that the growth of the cat population is a human-created problem, as these animals are simply following their biological instincts. Thus, a human-centered solution is essential.

Our mission is to intervene proactively, engaging individuals before they become frustrated with the process. By equipping them with essential items such as cat food, and free vaccines, we empower them to be prepared. Through these outreach efforts, we provide crucial information about Kitty Bungalow's programs, ensuring spay and neuters are readily available to those in need.

As a small rescue organization, we are chipping away at a huge problem with limited resources and all the other TNR and cat rescue organizations in Los Angeles. However, with an award of $75,000, we could provide over 42,900 individual cat meals and 600 full vaccines and microchips. Those households would receive information on TNR, low-cost veterinary resources, and the contact information of Kitty Bungalow for later cat rescue intervention. For every female cat we can TNR, we stop 180 kittens from being born. In the past year alone, that equates to approximately 221,400 cats, exponentially. Our intervention humanely reduces colonies over one or two generations, a massive public benefit considering the damage cats can do to buildings and bird populations.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "A grant from LA2050 would provide significant support to the UP4Youth Program and offer primary funding for the expansion of the staff. UP4Youth is based on four pillars: resource coordination, education planning and support, employment services, and mentorship. Resource Coordination UP4Youth staff provide one-on-one case management based on each youth's unique history, challenges, and goals. A comprehensive assessment of each youth's needs serves as the guiding document for the foundation of all future work. The team connects youth to housing, food, clothing, transportation, healthcare, childcare, and more. Education Planning and Support The team assists with educational goals - whether completing high school, accessing GED classes, or planning for continuing education. Youth are encouraged to recognize their potential and follow career aspirations. Employment Services ExtraFam helps youth attain a sustainable life by partnering with employment support agencies and offering regular workshops that focus on soft skills and practical knowledge. ExtraFam also recently completed the first year of a two-year initiative to enhance the program through paid internships. Mentorship ExtraFam trains caring mentors who help youth obtain vital resources, develop skills, and advance toward their goals. These compassionate adults help them develop emotional resources, make professional connections, and build positive habits to ensure sustainable, healthy progress.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "During the pandemic, the UP4Youth team focused on reaching as many young individuals in crisis as possible, as the need was tremendous. However, ExtraFam recognizes that due to the traumas that most of these youth have experienced, building thriving lives cannot be accomplished through short-term solutions. The addition of a second UP4Youth staff member will provide opportunities to build trust with youth and ensure they are matched with responsive, stable adult mentors. Only true partnerships rooted in mutual respect and consistency can result in long-term success. The UP4Youth team will support and empower each youth as they progressively develop self-sufficiency, confidence, and realize their dreams. Without support, these promising young people must reckon with adverse social, emotional, and economic consequences through no fault of their own. UP4Youth is integral to empowering traumatized youth in LA and stopping intergenerational cycles of poverty, violence, and exploitation.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The success of the UP4Youth program is measured using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. The intake process includes a self-assessment of each youth's needs, scored with ExtraFam's Self-Sufficiency Matrix, as well as the development of a personalized Individual Success Plan that serves as the guiding document for the foundation of all future work. Youth set three self-identified goals, putting them-rather than the system-in the driver's seat of their lives, often for the very first time. During the grant period, 60-75 TAY will participate in the UP4Youth Program and at least 40% will be matched with a trained adult mentor. A grant will allow staff to design accurate tools for defining and measuring positive advancements toward their education and employment goals and access to food, shelter, and mental health support.",

For those youth who have experienced complex trauma culminating in separation from their parents and their home, that opportunity is cut short. Last year in LA County, almost 1,500 youth aged out of foster care, without being reunified or adopted. These youth have formidable obstacles for their transition to adulthood, and systemic racism can compound their challenges. Statistically, former foster youth, by age 21, may experience homelessness (31%), are arrested (51%) or incarcerated (16%), and many young women have a child of their own (41%). These grim statistics are a glimpse into some of the challenges faced by former foster youth - but these challenges do not define them. These youth are not \"troubled\" or \"damaged\" and are in no way responsible for their trauma. They seek stability, love, and success, and they have the same innate potential for achievement as any one of their non-foster peers.",

With this support, LAFH will be able to expand our Housing Location efforts and secure new units for at least 1,000 unhoused people. Our team travels around Los Angeles to find affordable vacancies and connect with landlords unwilling to rent to unhoused Angelenos. While many believe in our mission, their bottom line is their bottom dollar. LAFH encourages landlords to accept unhoused tenants with a one-time incentive at move-in, through which each barrier overlooked by a landlord such as credit score or criminal background corresponds to a dollar value, up to a cap. With this approach, we have successfully removed roadblocks for people experiencing homelessness, made more affordable housing available, and helped destigmatize homelessness for the broader community. LAFH Housing Locators thoroughly consider tenant and landlord fit to ensure success for our participants. An immediate inspection of each unit is conducted for quality, and we refuse environments of undue scrutinization or discomfort. In order to ensure participants thrive in their apartments, each works with an LAFH Housing Stabilizer after move-in, so that they can continue accessing the support and resources they need even after they are housed.",

We measure our impact through data such as improvements in employment, housing retention, mental health, and other outcomes, as well as feedback from participant surveys and ongoing dialogue with case managers. In the first six months of 2023, our Housing Location team facilitated 456 successful move-ins. This includes finding 456 affordable apartments for participants, coordinating with landlords, verifying documentation, conducting inspections within 2-3 business days, ordering furniture, and providing a warm hand-off to LAFH Housing Stabilizers to ease participants' transition into housing.

The fair market rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles is $1,747. To afford this rent and utilities, a renter earning minimum wage would need to work nearly three full-time jobs. What limited affordable housing is available to low-income people is often inaccessible for people experiencing homelessness. Things outside of prospective tenants' control like immigration status, mental health needs, eviction history, level of income, and whether they hold a voucher often take them out of the running for renting an apartment.",

According to the U.S. Census, only 34.7% of the female population in Compton graduated high school, less than half of the national graduation rate of 85%. One result is that less than 9% of Compton's women attend college and earn a bachelor's degree. The lack of educational opportunity keeps families impoverished since those without high school diplomas make half of what college graduates gain. A lack of education often leads to homelessness, sex trafficking, and extremes such as self-harm and suicide. In L.A. County, 1 out of 10 youth have attempted suicide; 64% of teens with depression don't receive help, and 140,000 youth suffer from substance abuse.

Our program treats non-emergent, primary care medical needs of uninsured adults and children regardless of race, ethnicity or citizenship status. We provide a full range of adult and pediatric medical services, pre-natal care, general ob-gyn services. We also provide all required immunizations, treatment for STD, HIV, covid exposure as well as basic diagnostic lab testing, limited x-ray services. We participate in a special St. of California PrEP program which offers patients at high risk of contracting HIV an approved prophylactic to prevent further HIV contagion. Each new uninsured patient coming to our clinic is screened for medical necessity, urgentness and also screened for eligibility into our program. Patients who are elgible for Medi-Cal, Medicare, one of the Covered California health insurance programs are referred to the appropriate agencies for enrollment. Each approved uninsured patient is also given an income verification status.

This higher utilization is directly linked to higher rates of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, COPD and other chronic diseases which have been neglected and gone untreated for years. Each new enrolled patient under goes a comprehensive physical examination complete with a basic chem - 20 panel of lab tests. Our medical providers are able to ascertain the patient's current health status and create a comprehensive treatment plan for each patient.

Since its inception in 2008, Foster Love has provided pivotal resources to over 650,000 current and former foster youth nationwide with a large portion of this figure being dedicated to systems-impacted youth and families in Los Angeles County. By taking part in large-scale advocacy efforts, centering the voices of local youth with lived experience, and maintaining a trauma-informed staff, Foster Love keeps its finger on the pulse of current child welfare issues.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "This grant will provide critical support for the provision of Foster Love's innovative resources and services to high-risk current and former foster youth living in Los Angeles County. LA County foster youth continue to sit at the intersection of most of our country's major social problems: Homelessness, poverty, human trafficking, food insecurity, and more. Local youth in care are four times more likely to be diagnosed with a learning disorder and seven times more likely to suffer from anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Despite the fact that almost 100% of high school foster youth in LA County report dreams of graduating from college, only 50% will graduate with a high school diploma and only 3% will go on to graduate from college. Upon aging out, one out of every five local foster youth will become instantly homeless. Within 18 months, 50% will be homeless or incarcerated. Disturbingly, 60% of the children and young adults who have fallen victim to human trafficking are former foster youth. Foster Love works to mitigate trauma, improve outcomes, and provide unprecedented support to this vulnerable population through the provision of one-of-a-kind programs and services. These include but are not limited to the following: Sweet Cases (replacing the trash bags traditionally provided to children in care), STEM Boxes, Back 2 School Packs, full-tuition scholarships, sibling reunification events, mentorship, workforce entry support, emergency financial assistance, and much more.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Foster Love consistently evaluates the effectiveness of its programs internally using a variety of tools and methods to ensure successful outcomes and allow Foster Love to enact strategic programmatic improvements when necessary. These methods include the following: 1) Written and video testimonials from impacted youth, families, and caseworkers, 2) Partner satisfaction surveys, 3) Impact reports, 4) Grant reports, and 5) Data tracking. Foster Love utilizes the CRM software Zoho to diligently track our requests for support, services provided, and resources distributed. As an example, the Family Fellowship scholarship program has worked with 58 transition-age youth and graduated 26 of them with 90% of the program's recipients reaching full completion of their programs. Currently, 10 are pursuing advanced degrees and four have already graduated with at least a Master's. 100% of scholars have found employment in their respective fields and 38% have gone on to pursue a doctorate degree.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "At any given moment, there are approximately 30,000 children and youth navigating the traumas of the foster care system in LA County. Each of Foster Love's revolutionary programs are created intentionally and deliberately to target the issues that persist within the child welfare system and plague this often-forgotten population. The following list outlines our vision for the future of foster care in LA County along with the programs we pilot to accomplish this: 1) Return a sense of comfort, dignity, and stability to vulnerable youth during a traumatic time in their lives: Sweet Cases, teen shopping sprees 2) Create an environment in which foster youth can thrive: Sibling reunification events, Bike Build, Build A Board, Birthday Boxes, Superhero Boxes, adoption celebrations 3) Provide foster youth with equitable access to education and workforce opportunities: STEM Boxes, Back 2 School Packs, Family Fellowship scholarship, American Industries scholarship, Rapid Response program"

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "GYA's Youth Employment Program provides participants with pre-employment training, occupational mentorship, case management, supportive services and paid jobs. Youth will be placed in jobs within the community where they can learn the much-needed hands-on work experience necessary to succeed in the adult workforce. Worksite supervisors will take on the role of training and mentoring the participants. The case managers will follow up with each youth and their supervisor to make sure that they are making successful progress at their jobsites. GYA proposes that once the program participants are equipped with pre-employment skills and hands-on skills, they will secure unsubsidized full-time or part-time employment for a period of at least 6 months. During the training component of the program, youth will learn how to fill out a job application, create a resume that demonstrates their skills and experience, dress appropriately and communicate effectively during an interview. The training will also cover the fundamental skills necessary to succeed in the workplace such as work ethics, office and phone etiquette, the importance of punctuality, attendance, communication, and teamwork. Furthermore, GYA will provide financial literacy, exposure to various industries and labor market information. This project will be focused on serving the immigrant/refugee population as well as youth that have recently lost a parent or immediate family member.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The Youth Employment Program is for youth ages 14-24 from low to moderate-income families that are unable to secure employment without our services. The City of Glendale has a population of approximately 203,000 and a labor force of 103,700. Of the total population, 17.9% are under the age of 18. Approximately one-in-seven youth between the ages of 18 and 24 are considered disconnected, which means they are not in school or employed. The youth we serve are predominantly Armenian and Latino, with smaller numbers of Asian, White and African-American participants. Many of our youth participants are from immigrant families that are new to the country. About one-third to one-half of our clients' families receives public assistance. Based on Census reports, 15.6 percent of the population in Glendale lives in poverty. Majority of the youth in the program speak English as a second language and may have difficulty in school with their grades.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Based on the State of CA Employment Development Department Labor Market Information Division the unemployment rate in October 2022 for Los Angeles County was 4.5%, while youth unemployment rate was 8.5. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services states that students that are not involved in extracurricular activities are 49% more likely to have used drugs and 37% more likely to become teen parents than those who take part in extracurricular activities for one to four hours per week. GYA's Youth Employment Program participants develop the proper tools to successfully secure employment to become economically stable and remain above poverty levels. Training and work experience increases the probability that the youth will be able to secure and maintain employment in the future and become positive members of the greater Los Angeles community.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "GYA keeps excellent records to document program process and outcomes. All of the client data and performance-related data are tracked and available for monitoring. Each client also has a case file that is overseen by the Program Coordinator that documents the youth's progress. Sign-in sheets are used and kept for documentation purposes for all training sessions as well as paid work experience. Since 1993, GYA has made a significant impact in the lives of over 12,000 youth in our community and over the past year served 400 youth in six programs. While obtaining and retaining a job is at the heart of GYA's mission, ensuring the mental and physical health of the youth is also of paramount importance. As the needs of our community changes, GYA is at the forefront to meet these needs.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Youth will be placed to work at various departments and sections of the City of Glendale based on their skills and interest. Youth will have an opportunity to work side by side with public sector employees, creating opportunities for future careers."

Many clients are also dealing with multiple adverse childhood experiences (ACES) stemming from their family of origin: including family violence, neglect, mental illness, substance abuse or having an incarcerated family member. The greater the number and severity of ACES in a child's developmental years, the greater the negative impact to their health long-term, increasing their lifetime risk of depression, substance abuse, suicide attempts, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, poor academic achievement, heart disease, financial stress and other issues. Through our programs, we work to clients heal from wounds of the past, build communication, coping, stress management and other skills needed to live safely in LA.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "In order to support the immigrant and refugee community in the San Fernando Valley, Valley Family Center provides the following programs for the community provided in both Spanish and English: Counseling Program: includes individual, couple, & family therapy sessions for adults and children. Survivors of Domestic Violence Program: includes support groups, and counseling for victims and witnesses of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Sexual Abuse Awareness Group for non-offending caregivers of children who have been sexually abused meets weekly to help parents & guardians support their children as they move through the healing process and prevent future abuse.

Clients will have learned tools and techniques to move toward living a violence-free life. Additionally, not only will the 1,000 targeted clients be affected. Valley Family Center's services have a ripple effect on the wider community. We believe that \"helping one helps many.\" For each person we serve, life is transformed in some way. This, in turn, positively impacts the lives of the individual's family, friends, co-workers and ultimately the larger community in a positive manner.

This questionnaire measures progress made during counseling sessions. 2. Attendance rates are measured. The more a person attends, the better the outcome. 4. Clients complete a pretest/posttest to measure their knowledge and learning in each program. 5. Clinical progress notes aid in determining if treatment was successful. 6. Client satisfaction surveys are administered to each client. On average 80-85% of clients who enter Valley Family Center's various programs will achieve successful outcomes, including demonstrating an increase in knowledge regarding domestic violence, it's impact on children, symptom reduction, improved functioning and a better quality of life."

Over 270,000 youth/young adults are growing up in poverty and over 400,000 will have experienced abuse or neglect. These statistics, along with the fact that LA County has one of the largest child welfare systems in the U.S. (over 30,000 children in need of safe home), makes us compelled to increase our capacity and services to reach more vulnerable youth. At the age of 18, teens transition out of foster care and are expected to live independently, but most are ill-prepared for life's daily challenges. Their chances of ending up incarcerated or experiencing homelessness are extremely high. Equipping for Life is Olive Crest's upstream solution to combat these statistics and negative outcomes, as we equip youth (12-24) with the needed skills and supports to become independent and thrive."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Housing Works (HW) provides housing retention services those who have experienced chronic homelessness, severe mental illness and chronic health conditions with a 93% success rate, slamming the revolving door of homelessness for good. We launched Food Boost in 2020 when our frontline workers discovered that our most ill, vulnerable and homebound participants were literally starving in their apartments unable to access food during the pandemic due to transportation barriers, food deserts, illness and mental health crises. We now understand that the people we serve will always have difficulty accessing food-and particularly healthy food delivered with a food justice lens--due to extremely meager incomes, transportation barriers and poor health. They can't afford to order groceries from Instacart and don't have family members to help them out. We are their support system, connection to the world and interface in a world that doesn't know how to engage them with skill and compassion.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Today, HW provides weekly fresh food boxes and healthy served meals to 450 formerly chronically homeless individuals living in scattered-sites and nine affordable housing developments. We partner with the Hollywood Food Coalition to rescue and distribute food to our participants who are concentrated in South and Central Los Angeles. We recently partnered with the Sam Simon Foundation to provide vegan options to our participants in keeping with their health and religious practices. Our frontline workers and Food Boost staff are carefully trained in our best-practice approaches to work with people who have severe, persistent mental illness and trauma. Other food delivery programs aren't equipped to work with our participants and may inadvertently do harm. Over the next 18 months, HW and its housing partners will be opening 12 new Measure H or HHH-funded affordable housing developments with 1,575 units of housing. We estimate that 800-1,000 new individuals will need food assistance and our skilled interface by the end of 2024. HW must build the capacity of its Food Boost program capacity to ensure that our collective investments in housing yield long-term housing retention if we are to seriously address homelessness. In order to prepare for this expansion, HW needs a dedicated food delivery van and program equipment (long foldable tables, pop-up canopies, and hand-trucks) for our weekly distribution events at the developments to be efficient and orderly.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles County will be different if the city and county's historic investments in affordable housing yield the desired outcomes: moving people from the streets into permanent housing, helping them to retain that housing, and helping them to remain healthy. Housing Works has the trust of its participants and knows their needs intimately. It has the ability to address their food security issues while understanding their health, mental health and financial realities. The people who deliver the food are trained in our art of human engagement strategies that help people with mental illness feel safe and cared for without further traumatizing or triggering them. Housing Works also has existing relationships with affordable housing developers and contracts to provide on-site services at their developments, including Hollywood Community Housing Corporation, WORKS, RNLA, Many Mansions, Little Tokyo Service Center and more. Food Boost is a welcome service at these developments."

We will run two concurrent cohorts: one of 10 LGBTQI+ Black and Native survivors, and one of 10 LGBTQI+ survivors of color (separating folks this way due to requests from our own membership base over the years). We will bring both cohorts together for the kick off and closing events. This program would be the first of its kind in LA County and perhaps in the US. The first three months will be used to design and implement the application and outreach process. Over the six month program period, the cohorts would attend a series of workshops on the disproportionate effect of CSA on the LGBTQI community, design and test innovations addressing survivorship at their staff, member and client levels, and learn to educate their public community about the scope of the issue. Each trainee will also receive coaching and technical assistance to support the design of a small pilot (an event or training) they will implement during the program, culminating in a presentation showcase. The final three months of the grant period will entail evaluation and dissemination of learnings.",

We piloted our Training Institute for BIPOC LGBTQI survivors in 2019, with great success (as measured by post-cohort surveys tracking self-reported data on feeling part of a community of belonging, feeling autonomy and skill around having tools and support for ongoing healing and for organizing to end the ongoing violence of child sexual abuse, and on trainees' post-cohort opportunities to get paid to engage in related work).",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Mirror Memoirs expects this initiative to increase the capacity of LA County organizations to address CSA survivorship among their staff, members and clients, creating a stronger ecosystem of organizations addressing the needs of some of the most vulnerable Angelenos: BIPOC LGBTQI+ survivors. Our long-term goal is to increase the capacity of all social justice and direct service organizations to both address CSA survivorship among staff and clients and prevent this violence from occurring. We envision this work beginning in Los Angeles County, where we are headquartered, but scaling over time throughout California (and eventually nationwide).",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In the US, at least 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 13 boys are raped or sexually assaulted by age 18. And, a 2011 study from the American Journal of Public Health found LGBTQI+ people are 3.8 times likelier to experience child sexual assault (CSA). Being a survivor comes with lifelong challenges, including but not limited to mental and chronic illness, poverty, and increased criminalization. COVID-19 exacerbated the vulnerability of BIPOC LGBTQI+ CSA survivors, due to underemployment, precarious housing, insufficient healthcare, lack of family support, and threats of hate violence - especially as most states have proposed legislation targeting LGBTQ, and especially transgender, people. As CA has named itself a sanctuary for transgender people, LA County must care for the survivors within this community.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "While this is not a collaborative proposal, we will recruit the 20 Training Institute cohort members from our existing network of partner organizations throughout LA County. Our members include leaders of several BIPOC LGBTQI+ serving organizations, including but not limited to: TransLatin@ Coalition, APAIT, Gender Justice LA, Trans Wellness Center, Unique Woman's Coalition, APAIT, TG/Enby Project, LA Spoonie Collective, Long Beach LGBTQ Center, LA LGBT Center Trans Economic Empowerment Project and the Trevor Project. Our office is also located in the Connie Norman Transgender Empowerment Center.

IHO's strategy is to partner with community stakeholders to identify treasured resources and amenities, leveraging those connections to build trust. We then find the win-win among competing stakeholders so that all can find a way to build roots and success. We use our expertise in housing and community development to create a legacy that builds community pride and self-reliance.

By empowering youths with knowledge of substance use, they can carry that knowledge and share it with their community members and reduce substance use harm. The workshops are held in a way that is trauma informed and never reinforce stereotypes of those youths who are already using substances. Instead, in these workshops, we offer alternatives for those youths by offering them activities that are not substance related and are self-empowerment based. Second, we will be providing free gender affirmative drop-in counseling services for participants of the workshop. By providing a safe space and person to speak to about their challenges, we encourage youths to reflect on and cope with their feelings rather than to engage in substance misuse.

Black women have experienced a particularly significant increase in overdose fatality rates, surpassing other racial or ethnic groups with a staggering rise of 144% from 2015 to 2020. The disparities in health and social consequences faced by racial minorities, especially African-Americans, can be attributed to inadequate representation, a lack of culturally-responsive training, and curriculum that fails to address the unique needs of these communities in treatment settings, as highlighted by reports from SAMSHA and the Institute of Medicine."

    "summary": "The youth of Los Angeles tell the best stories about our city, but many of them aren't given the opportunity. That's why 826LA provides free writing and tutoring programs for those students, most of whom are from under-resourced communities. Working one-on-one with caring volunteers, students are given the opportunity to follow their imaginations, develop their voices, improve their academics, work on college application essays, learn about the creative economy, and become published authors, with 826LA's free programs and support.",
    "goal": "LEARN",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "With support from LA2050, 826LA will expand its Young Authors Book Project (YABP), a project traditionally reserved for one cohort of students, to seven cohorts. In schools, we will partner with teachers to develop book-length projects that support their curricular needs. In our writing centers, we will work with students to identify the theme for the anthologized volume. This will upgrade \"zine-quality\" publications to professional-grade books. YABP involves sustained student engagement over the course of a semester or school year. We will also continue our work with book-making field trips, in which classes of students attend a 3-hour field trip at one of our writing centers,where they co-author a zine-quality book together. YABP and our Field Trips meet the goals of LA 2050's program by exposing students to creativity across a wide range of writing, culminating in the production of professional-grade published anthologies, or zines, in which each student has contributed a unique, meaningful piece. 826LA's creative workshops are made possible by the exceptional teaching artists who lead them and the trained community volunteers who support them. Teaching artists include writers, poets, artists, designers, photographers, and professionals, and student work is objectively assessed along two distinct trajectories.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In our tutoring centers, students participate in pre-and post-program Analytic Writing Continuum (AWC) assessments designed by the National Writing Project. For two years now, our students saw an average 6% gain in the AWC from pretest to post-test, a notable, statistically significant improvement. The same writing samples are assessed for creativity and, likewise, reflect 6% gains. Because our In-Schools programs support the teaching goals of our partner teachers, formal assessment comes in the form of grades, while informal assessment is provided by dedicated volunteers. Moreover, 826LA conducts post-program surveys of students, teachers, volunteers, and many parents. 100% of teachers surveyed noted an increase in creativity with their students, 97.4% noted marked improvement in their students' motivation to write and persistence in the writing process, and 75% noted pronounced student improvement in writing conventions (grammar, syntax, punctuation, etc.).",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Student voices and stories are nearly invisible in publishing and entertainment, not only in Los Angeles, but throughout the United States. When students worked on the 826LA publication Mapping Our Roots, for example, they conducted oral histories within their families and neighborhoods. When they wrote Through the Same Halls, students interviewed elders to generate a local history of the neighborhood around their school. Most recently, when they wrote Holding On to the Future, they engaged in creative envisioning of their and LA's future. 826LA helps students develop a lasting, positive relationship with writing that catalyzes their ability to live fully included in the halls of power, in the creative economy, and wherever their paths may lead. 826LA is building a future in which our students can see themselves as participants in the creative power of LA's world class museums, universities, film, television, streaming, gaming studios, and publishing houses.",

A recent LA Times series on LAUSD had these major findings: The gap in grades (academic achievement gap) that was already pronounced before the pandemic between Black and Latino students, on the one hand, and white and Asian counterparts on the other, widened to as much as 21 percentage points. Over a third of the students in the demographics that 826LA serves do not have an appropriate, quiet place at home to study. Perhaps the most concerning statistic comes from the office of the LAUSD Superintendent, who has identified chronic absenteeism as a top concern. At the end of the 2021-22 school year, Los Angeles Unified's chronic absenteeism rate was 45.2%, and in March of this year, 36% of students were chronically absent.",

Dropout rates are high, there are significant gaps in education across socioeconomic groups, and the U.S. needs to keep up with other industrialized countries in terms of student performance in mathematics, science and reading. Studies show that kids drop out because they are bored? don't see how school relates to real life and work? and aren't prepared to succeed by their earlier schooling. When asked how schools could help, 81% asked for more real-world learning and said they wanted school to be more connected to getting a good job. The solution is to provide students with hands-on, project-based learning programs showing how their education relates to real-world success. Research suggests that earlier investments in entrepreneurship education are more likely to impact educational and career outcomes significantly, so focusing on elementary and middle school students is critical.",

Temple University Professor David Nickerson, an expert on evaluating voting programs, reviewed our 2021 pilot program in Orange County, California and found that our student-led drives raised voter registration rates by 6.3 percentage points above rates in comparable school districts, with no obvious barriers to scale.

TCC has demonstrated its ability to support educators in facilitating student-led voter registration drives and to develop tools and research to help young people measure and understand their civic impact. This project will expand on TCC's work by allowing us to combine these areas of expertise in a paid professional learning opportunity. The professional development series will train educators on accessing and analyzing hyperlocal data on youth civic engagement and empowering student-leaders in running effective voter registration drives. The outcome will be for educators to design a unique lesson plan and related drive strategy that incorporates youth voice, data analysis and a plan for replicating the effort year after year. The Civics Center will support schools in executing on their drive strategy by coaching student-educator teams, providing lesson plan resources and free Democracy in a Box toolkits that include physical and digital materials needed for a drive.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Every year, four million Americans turn 18 and become eligible to vote - but less than half of them do so. Though California allows young people to preregister to vote starting at age 16, less than 15% of 16- to 17-year-olds In LA County are preregistered. Our research in LA County shows an inverse correlation between child poverty rates and registration rates of the youngest eligible voters. Thus, low-income high schools (defined as schools where at least 50% of students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch) represent a critical opportunity to empower young voters, particularly those that are historically disenfranchised based on race/ethnicity, educational attainment and socio-economic status. To strengthen our democracy here in LA, we must act to make voter registration and civic engagement a part of every high school students' experience, empowering a generation of lifelong voters able to advocate for themselves and their communities.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In the short term, this program empowers students and educators to develop a deeper understanding of youth civic power and share that knowledge through voter registration drives scaffolded by STEAM-driven curriculum. This will bring more voter registration drives to LA County schools and a higher level of civic awareness and sense of efficacy for students in those schools. In the long term, we know that students who register early on are more likely to become lifelong voters and remain civically engaged. The students who help facilitate the drive will have developed increased skills in communicating, organizing and leadership, 21st century skills they can use later in life. Finally, these schools will have the institutional knowledge that is needed to make these opportunities available to students year after year, paving the way for a stronger, more equitable and just multi-racial democracy here in LA County.",

In 2022, over half (67%) of Cast clients had PTSD symptoms when they started services.

Since many of Cast's clients share the therapist's gender, ethnicity, country of origin and language, and may be more likely to accept mental health and emotional wellness services while at Cast as a result. Therefore this program will deepen our current mental health and wellness offerings by expanding referral options, as many clients face long wait lists (sometimes as long as 6 months) and have long requested therapy services with mental health professionals who are familiar with trafficking and their cultural background. As part of our case management model, Cast staff will identify and refer clients in need of mental health services who will most benefit from this therapist. Over one year, we anticipate this therapist will provide timely individual, therapy to 37 survivors of human trafficking. Sessions will be offered virtually.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Survivors of human trafficking struggle with severe trauma which affects their ability to recover in other areas of their lives. Wellbeing is a key factor in survivors' long term recovery and ability to avoid being trafficked again. LA County will benefit through healthier residents who will be less reliant on its resources. Across the anti-trafficking movement, therapy has been under-resourced for survivors. This project will demonstrate the efficiency of providing this resource to survivors of trafficking and other forms of violence (e.g. domestic violence) in a timely, culturally-appropriate way. With funds, Cast wants to expand this program to provide greater amounts of mental health care in-house, which survivors have requested based on their trust in us and their wish to not have to repeat their traumatic story to multiple service providers."

The short and long terms effects of such trauma include PTSD, anxiety, suicide, depression, addiction, and much more. Social structures also shape victims' experiences with institutions such as hospitals, police, and courts, which often end up re-victimizing survivors instead of getting them the justice and healing they deserve. Navigating these institutions in addition to the lasting impacts of trauma can be isolating.

By creating a safe, supportive, survivorship community and environment there is a greater potential for survivors to thrive past trauma. Our programs provide direct services to survivors who are still dealing with the constant effects of sexual and domestic violence. The programs include support groups, advocacy assistance regarding the civil and criminal legal system, therapy, permanent support that promotes healing from the impact of trauma, and education on intimate partner violence, child abuse, and sexual assault. When survivors of sexual violence have felt alone in their trauma, the healing power of connection is profound. Because healing is not linear and every survivor has special needs, we created multiple survivorship programs amongst survivors to encourage one another. Our survivorship programs are innovative methods of therapy that consist of social activities and therapeutic recreation: yoga, sound baths, meditation, self-defense classes, retreats, spa treatments, dance, and much more. Currently we have to rely mostly on the generous contributions of time and talent from local therapists, advocates, instructors, and other community partners, many of which are survivors themselves. We could make a much bigger impact if we were able to pay these partners so they could dedicate more time to supporting survivors, or if we could reach out to other partners that cannot donate services.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Giving survivors the opportunity to heal can have a variety of impacts outside of the survivors themselves. Increased awareness of sexual violence can help empower people to be active bystanders to prevent violence and encourage communities to believe and support survivors. Once survivors are believed and supported by their community, empowered survivors are more likely to seek medical attention and report the crime. Higher rates of reporting could potentially lead to more convictions and a safer community. Also, when survivors are able to heal from their trauma, they can blossom in other areas of their life. They can be more productive at work, strengthen bonds with family and friends, and be more present in their community. Helping people release themselves from the burden of sexual trauma is a vital step towards helping communities in LA County to flourish.",

For example, in our virtual survivor meetups, there were a few people who shared their experience of sexual trauma for the first time ever. Having these types of spaces for survivors can truly open the door to healing that otherwise may have remained closed for much longer. In the past year we've held these survivor meetups, virtual group therapy sessions, our first annual fundraiser, aerial dance classes for survivors, boxing classes for survivors, a survivor workout, a community sound bath, and a breakfast event with a panel of survivors discussing the impact of sexual violence. We can see that each survivor involved in these events feels less alone after hearing the stories of other survivors."

KazooBadoo provides our overworked teachers and our underfunded schools with a tool to effectively engage kids in their learning, and our AI driven personalization will allow each student to learn at their own pace and in the way that they learn best. Our platform also provides teachers and parents with deep metrics on their child's experience and on how they learn, so that they can best support their student.",

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Health Care Access",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "More than 1 in 10 American adults experienced pain every day during the last 3 months. Nearly 40 million felt severe pain. People with severe pain have worse health, use more health care, and have greater disability levels. Chronic pain and mental health disorders are also deeply intertwined. Depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders are widely experienced by individuals with chronic pain. To address their pain, many people turn to opioids. The misuse of and addiction to opioids-including prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl-is a national crisis. All people deserve safe, affordable and effective alternatives for pain management. For example, acupuncture has been used in Asia for centuries to treat many conditions and relieve pain. It can ease low back pain, nerve pain, headaches, fibromyalgia, menstrual cramps - and more. SCC wants to make acupuncture, shockwave therapy and other drug alternatives, available to more people.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "To provide patients with alternative, effective pain management, SCC has launched a Holistic Approach Pain Intervention (HAPI) Clinic. The HAPI Clinic employs Eastern and Western medical techniques to optimize pain relief and restore health. Patients are co-managed with their primary care provider and appointments are by referral from SCC providers only. The Clinic is offered 3 days a week. SCC hopes to expand the treatment methods at HAPI Clinic to include shockwave therapy (helps to treat chronic tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendonitis, among other conditions). With this new machine, and additional financial support, more patients can access the benefits of alternative pain management. The HAPI Clinic is run by Dr. Tinh Vuong, a board certified Family Medicine Physician who is also a licensed acupuncturist. She completed her medical training at Harbor UCLA. Her interests are in integrative and regenerative medicine, combining Eastern and Western medicine to heal acute and chronic pain. With over 20 years of experience, she practices a holistic and integrative approach to stimulate the body's innate ability to heal itself back to vibrant health.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Through the HAPI Clinic, SCC anticipates having a positive, substantive and measurable impact for people in LA County who are struggling with pain management. In the short term, this grant would allow SCC to offer a minimum of 2000 pain management patient visits this year! In the longer term, SCC would like to expand the clinic to additional locations. Our main limitations currently are physical space and funding for more staff providers. With a grant from LA2050, we can begin to expand the work and scope of the HAPI Clinic. Together, we can help low-income, medically under-served patients access the quality, compassionate pain management they deserve.",

Just 15% of 4th to 8th girls show interest in STEM. Women represent only 28% of employed scientists and engineers in the U.S., and just 2% are Latinas, who we overwhelmingly serve. During our first decade, which led into the pandemic, this focus meant we prioritized engaging girls in STEM projects and learning, with the goal of capturing their interest and showing them that they can be successful in fields where they might not normally be directed. This work continues, but since the pandemic we have seen that what girls need to succeed has evolved dramatically. These long-standing gaps in opportunity and support are now intensified by girls' mental health challenges and their lack of connection and community, which we now also are working to address.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our Creative Technologies STEM education programs have been designed by women in STEM fields who share the same lived experiences as our participants. They integrate engagement and capacity building, helping girls master technical and practical skills as they learn about educational and career opportunities, while simultaneously fostering self-confidence, initiative and curiosity within a community of peers, instructors and mentors. This combination of tech and heart drives our impact and success and includes: Creative Electronics, a 10-week after-school program for 210, 5th grade girls held at partnering elementary schools that sparks curiosity and exploration with technology by providing experiences that promote the development of technical skills, expression of creativity and self-confidence. Girls participate in 2-hour sessions once per week. Creative Engineering, a 10-week after-school program for 144, 6th - 8th grade girls held at partnering middle schools that combines the art of painting with the art of making and coding, learning about an overarching STEM-based theme that changes annually, themes such as biomes, endangered species, green agriculture, and space. Girls participate in 2-hour sessions once per week. The newest element to these programs is the additional social-emotional learning within a supportive community of girls who learn together, collaborate on projects and believe they can be successful, even if they do not get something right the first time."

Median weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers in the U.S. increase in tandem with education. In 2022, workers without a high school diploma earned $682; while workers with a high school diploma earned $853; and workers with a bachelor's degree earned $1,432. At the same time, unemployment rates are inversely proportionate to education-in 2022, 5.5% of individuals without a high school diploma were unemployed; while 4% of individuals with a high school diploma were unemployed; and 2.2% of individuals without a bachelor's degree were unemployed. In Los Angeles, the rate and number of disconnected youth has increased significantly since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. In 2021, 12.9% of 16 to 24-year-olds living in L.A.

Each year, the rate and number of disconnected youth in Los Angeles County will shrink as traditionally underserved young adults-including youth involved in the child welfare or juvenile justice systems, youth experiencing homelessness, and parenting youth-achieve financial independence and stability. Through YouthSource, young adults will change the landscape of Los Angeles: strengthening families by helping them attain economic sustainability, strengthening the labor market by filling it with diverse, well-trained workers; and strengthening society by reducing income inequality across ages and races."

Regular check-ins with families allow us to ensure their progress, incorporate their feedback, and encourage self-advocacy. NAC will assist clients in these areas and supply other needs as they transition into their new lives and exhibit increasing levels of independence. Our focus in the clients' critical first 3-6 months after arrival is to establish stability and a clear path forward.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "NAC strives for new arrivals like the Barati family to become connected and empowered. When the Baratis arrived, NAC arranged a temporary furnished apartment and assisted Jalil in finding two part-time jobs. NAC put out word that Jalil was an artist, and within hours locals donated paints, brushes, canvas, a camera, and a computer. The family signed a lease on an apartment in Pomona with NAC's support. Now, Jalil has been promoted to manager at one of his jobs and Zuhal is expecting another baby. This is how we envision LA County will and should look: a place where the community welcomes newcomers and quickly helps them with their needs toward self-sufficiency. NAC aspires to have temporary furnished apartments ready immediately for new arrivals, and then to tap into our network of community members and past clients to help newcomers find better jobs and permanent housing. We believe in a more united, more vibrant shared community where newcomers feel immediately at home."

Our unique blended mentorship model as a hallmark, short-term, group exposure to many women and careers, allows girls to exercise their ability to relate confidently to adults, learn to network successfully and reap the benefits of a powerful \"village\" of support. Step Up's program delivery and outreach focuses on reaching girls from communities that are underrecognized and facing systemic and institutional barriers to opportunity. Empowering the next generation through mentorship, Step Up girls and young adults gain support to feel confident, connected, and career-ready in their paths to success.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles will gain more confident, career-ready, and connected teens and young adults with the expansion of Step Up's career exploration programs. During the 22-23 school year, Step Up has provided more than 1,500 additional hours of social emotional skill building and career exploration programming to 175 Los Angeles teens across six schools. To meet the demand of our waitlist of school and community partners, Step Up aims to serve at least 300 Los Angeles teens during the upcoming school year. We intentionally support high school teens identifying with girlhood ages 14-18, in partnership with high schools who support students living in unrecognized communities. 97% of Step Up girls identify as a person of color, and more than 60% of Step Up girls would be the first in their family to attend college. We hope to be able to expand specific opportunities for creative industry exposure and workforce development with partners like NBCUniversal, The A List, and Creative Artists Agency.",

Through participation in our Campus program in collaboration with Los Angeles Area High Schools, teens gain access to places and people, seeking to guide the next generation of leaders in their post-secondary and career journeys. Specifically in Step Up Explore Pathways Programs, teens and young adults ages 14-29 are able explore career opportunities based on their own individual strengths, values, and preferences and have proven to both jumpstart and deepen a girl's college and career exploration. With Step Up programs, participants can experience an Explore Pathways fieldtrip or virtual job shadowing experience helping them to build tangible skills, industry connections, and support in their development and success. Providing a unique, safe space for teens and young women to feel confident in exploring creative careers with prominent companies and employers is essential in empowering the next generation of leaders in seeing what they can be. During its last program year (2021-22) Step Up engaged nearly 250 unique young adults and over 500 teens, 97% of Step Up who identify as being from a community of color, 100% of Step Up participants had access to multiple professional women role models, and 84% of participants reported growth in their confidence.",

My understanding of the issue of homelessness is not just personal but relational. SOFESA has navigated the social services systems for over 2 decades now and our biggest job is advocating for our families and educating them on the paperwork, processes and transactions necessary for them to access the help available. We were doing this before the 2-1-1 CES and are still doing it. We understand not just the lived experiences of those who are homeless, but the experience of exiting homelessness, healing from previous traumas and developing a deeper understanding of the post-homeless life. We also know the needs of the local hound community and have found that in creating the healthy middle ground for the housed and unhoused to connect with one another is vital.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our Emergency Outreach Program approach is relational, not transactional. In the past 24 years of accompanying homeless persons, especially families, we have found that entering into healthy, lifelong relationships with those experiencing homelessness creates a sense of stability and belonging that allows them an opportunity to heal and make different decisions for themselves and their circumstances. Los Angeles county would look very different if we implemented our model of care, which is local community based and involves the housed in relationship with the unhoused. At the center of homelessness is a person, not a house. People deserve healing, they are not a problem to solved. What would LA County look like if outreach programs engaged in that type of model of care? definitely a lot healthier than what is happening now, that's for sure!"

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "SGVFDH has been providing high quality dental care, screenings and education to low-income youth for 25 years. Founded in 1996, the clinic opened in 1997 and has provided more than $4.5 million worth of dental care to 12,500+ low-income children and provided dental education to 155,000+ low-income children and their families. In addition to treating 431 children and 277 adults this past year in our clinic, SGVFDH also provided dental screenings, education and/or fluoride treatments to 7,949 Head Start and school students throughout the San Gabriel Valley, as well as dental education to 676 individuals in our community and in our clinic. This combination of preventive and restorative dental care, screenings and education to underserved youth and their families reduces barriers in access to oral health care and assists in meeting the immediate needs of underserved populations. Our clinic staff works diligently to deal with the issues caused by the socioeconomic disparities in the treatment of oral health problems, which affect low-income children the most. ?The percentage below shows that our dentists and hygienists are cutting a clear path to reducing the number of cavities, infection and gum disease. Of those children returning to the clinic for periodic dental exams last fiscal year, 60% had no new decay or disease. This proves that with regular exams and education, we can make a difference in the future of our children's dental health. ??",

Statistics relating to the number of patients treated and recurrence of dental decay are recorded after each clinic session and reported at quarterly board meetings. Records are also kept at all screenings, including the number of students with decay.

Most of our new patients lack a dental home, and come to us only when they are in extreme pain.

Hundreds of pounds of delicious proteins, vegetables, grains, and more were scraped into the dumpster, adding waste to our landfills, and CO2 emissions to our environment. In most cases this would happen just feet away from a shelter or someone unhoused struggling with food insecurity. Every Day Action was created to change the way Hollywood sees food waste. Led by a team actively working in the entertainment industry, we have an inside knowledge and understanding of our donors and their work. We \"speak production\" and approach food recovery with the same professionalism we do with our work on film sets. Los Angeles has abundant food supplies to help those struggling with food insecurity, they are just not being redistributed properly.

Weekly we are saving an average of 2,500-7,500 meals, averaging around 60,000 annually, and delivering those meals directly to those across Los Angeles struggling with food insecurity. We serve a large geographic area, and an expansive demographic of people experiencing different levels of food insecurity. We have partnered with shelters to expand the hours they serve and the amount of food provided. Oftentimes the staff running shelters and housing projects are also struggling with food insecurity themselves; our hot food allows them to not only feed their residents but their employees, reducing their overhead costs and allowing them to have more reliable food on a more consistent basis. The meals we provide are not what is typically offered to the unhoused community. We are relocating gourmet catering that is nutritious and includes proteins, vegetables, grains, and more. Many of our beneficiaries complain of a lack of food variety in shelters and are regularly given sandwiches; with our food, they are enjoying a complete meal.

Qualitative feedback has been universally positive, with set staff grateful that they don't have to throw gourmet food into the dumpster and are happy that our drivers understand how to conduct themselves on a set. The organizations to which we donate are grateful for the extra food, and its quality, which gives clients nutritious and tasty options that go beyond the basics.

What's being produced is too expensive for working and middle class people. 2. The region's cities grant few legal protections to tenants. To fix this problem, we need to build people-power and shift policy. But currently, there aren't many community groups in the SGV working with people facing housing insecurity. Renters aren't well organized and lack civic influence even in tenant-majority cities. Building power to change this situation is complicated because so many people experience housing struggles as an individual challenge, not a systemic one.

These experiences will help our storytellers build confidence, overcome the shame associated with housing insecurity, and publicly confront the failures of our systems. The story-tellers will develop into public leaders. Together these stories will demonstrate the reach and depth of the SGV's housing needs. We'll use social media and press outreach to amplify the stories. Participants will get video of their own stories so they can share out directly.

In the long term, this narrative shift, leadership development, and community building will translate to the people-power to implement policies that protect tenants and increase the number of people living in permanently affordable housing.

The intent of the pop-up interventions is to have the flexibility to become permanent additions to the street experience in Los Angeles and give back to the communities hosting the 2028 Games for generations to come. The Festival Trail stitches together existing active and public transportation projects already built or in construction by LA Metro, who are planning for car-free venues, mobility hubs, and a dedicated bus network.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Success for us is both a process as well as an outcome. Each segment of the trail will be designed by local designers, architects, and community leaders in collaboration with a corporate sponsor. The process of design-community-driven and decentralized-is integral to the success of this effort and, therefore, one of our measurable goals. Within the timeline of the grant year, we anticipate achieving the following deliverables: - Two dozen coalition partners/supporters in the nonprofit, business, and labor communities - Buy-in from the Mayors of Los Angeles, Inglewood, the County Board of Supervisors, Los Angeles Metro, and the LA28 (the 2028 Games organizing committee). - At least two viable community investment plans - Up to five community pop-ups or charettes (workshops) for residents to engage with the concept at community events - A digital prototype for a \"kit-of-parts\" for the Festival Trail hubs"

According to a Long Beach's Health and Human Services report in late 2021, 42% of adults in Long Beach reported recent anxiety or depression; 37% of youth ages 13-17 said they needed help for emotional or mental health problems; and 31% of CA youth ages 18-24 reported suicidal ideation at some point in their lives - an increase from 24% in 2020. Adults, youth, and children are dealing with a wide range of circumstances that have resulted in depression, anxiety, and antisocial or destructive behavior. Many children / youth have a parent/caregiver with a mental illness and/or substance abuse problem; be the victims of abuse, neglect, or family violence; have behavior challenges at school; emulate maladaptive behaviors of parents in crises or are at risk of being removed from their home by the DCFS. Recently, JFCS has experienced an uptick in suicidal ideation in younger children.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Once clients begin counseling, they complete 2 surveys (Individual Self-Survey and Cross-Cutting Scale) that measure current behaviors contributing to their presenting problem and their current satisfaction in life. These surveys that help evaluate the clients' measure of success in therapy are completed at the first session, midpoint, and last session. For children, success is measured by an improvement in the Children's Global Assessment Scale, which rates the functioning of youth under 18 years. Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS) survey is also used for children and is completed by the child's parent(s)/guardian(s). CIS addresses interpersonal relations, psychopathological domains, functioning in schoolwork, and leisure time. Comparisons are made between the client's and clinician's evaluation to determine if the intervention and treatment plan met the mutually agreed upon therapeutic goals. All evaluation results are documented by clinicians and assessed by clinical supervisors.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Under professional JFCS supervision, LIC services are provided by MSW and MFT graduate and post-graduate level clinicians whose cultural diversity mirrors our community's. At the start of LIC's program, clients self-present or are referred to JFCS. Clients are then referred to an intake team. A team member gathers more information about the client's presenting problem. Coordinator then assigns client to a student clinician who then evaluates the severity of the client's symptoms. After assessment, the clinician, client, and parent/guardian mutually agree upon an intervention and treatment plan, which may include special treatment. Clinicians look at each client, child, and family holistically, evaluating all their needs. Once the client begins counseling, clients complete 2 surveys that measure their behaviors. Surveys are conducted at the first, midpoint, and last sessions. They help evaluate clients' measure of success in therapy. Outputs: - Provide cost-effective intervention to 500 low-income, uninsured, or indigent clients with 6,000 hours of individual, couple, and family therapy over 12 months. - Provide 300 hours of group therapy to low-income, uninsured, or indigent clients over 12 months. - Provide 80 - 100 women, children, and their families with appropriate safety plans, intervention, and counseling services over 12 months. - Provide 30 - 40 female abuse survivors with specialized ongoing group education as part of their continuum of care over 12 months.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "JFCS' vision is to see a community healed, one person, one family, at a time. Last year, JFCS served 2,118 people with immediate safety plans, intervention, and counseling services. During this 2023 - 2024 grant period, JFCS hopes to serve 2,400 individuals in Long Beach and surrounding communities. Of note is our plans to re-launch our refugee resettlement program in late 2023 with funds from the federal and state governments. The program will potentially serve an additional 300 Ukrainian, Afghan, Syrian, or Eritrean refugees through our greatly expanded Refugee Resettlement and Assistance program. Our JFCS social workers and other staff will assess the needs of these refugees and assist them with food, emergency housing, and transportation, only made possible through the financial support of foundations, corporations, and generous donors. Additionally, we will provide them with mental health support and information, referrals, and linkages to other identified service providers.",

For young BIPOC people, the stress of the pandemic is compounded by the trauma of increasingly visible racism and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on their communities. In South LA, 37% of teenagers said they needed mental and/or emotional health care.

Beyond the classroom, we are growing our digital presence in response to the growing needs young people have expressed for accessible, free, and youth-friendly health content and resources. Our web-app selfsea (visit selfsea.org) was built with young people in response to their health priorities. Selfsea has over 204,000 users across the country (10,000 from LA), and our TikTok health videos have reached over 9 million views. By making it easy and approachable for young people to connect to app-suggested resources, selfsea is also increasing help-seeking behaviors for health and connecting LA's young people to care.

They work with some of the most vulnerable children from Central America, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Angola. When children are apprehended without a parent or legal guardian, they are declared unaccompanied, transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and placed in removal proceedings. In 2023, California ORR facilities have almost doubled to meet the demand of incoming immigrant children, most of whom have to defend themselves in court-with or without a lawyer-in adversarial proceedings designed for adults.

Upon arrival, immigration officials separated the brothers, placing C in ORR and his adult brother in ICE. C was devastated by this. While detained, ORR attempted to provide him with psychosocial support but were unsuccessful because the facility lacked language interpretation. Meanwhile, C's brother was released to their older sister, who lives in the U.S., and we were assigned to C's case.

We are assigned to pregnant and parenting youth, children with disabilities, children who identify as LGBTQIA+, tender-age children, and victims of trafficking. Child Advocates meet weekly with children to learn their stories, wishes, and needs over time. With this information, they work alongside Young Center attorneys and social workers to craft recommendations that consider the child's best interests and are grounded in our Child Rights Paradigm-which are submitted to immigration judges and others with decision-making power over the child's case. We advocate for children to be quickly placed with family or in family-like settings outside of ORR custody, to have access to the support and services they need to thrive while detained and once released, and for their individual identities, culture, language, trauma history, and wishes to be heard and respected by anyone making decisions on their behalf.",

These low proficiency levels are in part due to insufficient STEAM educational resources in K-12 schools, especially Title I schools. Unfortunately, this lack of resources leads to more than just low test scores: it also largely contributes to the underrepresentation of minority groups--particularly Hispanics and African Americans--in STEAM careers. As long as these underserved populations continue to be deprived of educational opportunities early in life, test scores will remain low, and students will keep believing that STEAM subjects and careers are out of their reach.",

Our vision is that these exciting and interactive programs will inspire students to take a deeper interest in space-science topics and will lead them to be more engaged in the classroom and have a more solid understanding of STEAM material. Research has shown that mere interest in STEAM topics plays an important role in students' desire to continue studying STEAM subjects later in life, and that even informal learning environments increase students' interest in STEAM subjects. Therefore, we envision an increase in students pursuing STEAM degrees and careers later in life. And because most participants are from underserved populations who typically have less access to STEAM education and who are underrepresented in STEAM career fields, we hope this experience ultimately leads to a more thriving and diverse STEAM workforce in Los Angeles in the future.",

We focus on activities to support learning by enhancing curriculum to meet the needs of youth. RoboQuest is a curriculum that bridges learning gaps through creation of a unique league where youth explore creativity by building robots, programming, and coding promoting teamwork using Legos. This fun, innovative form of learning fosters self-efficacy and a sense of belonging. The enhanced curriculum expands STEAM learning through hands-on, interactive sessions that fuel understanding and ignite passion for learning through league activities. Discovery Leagues allow fun project based learning through innovation while collaborating and creating healthy competition. Discovery Leagues promote partnership with existing organizations to maximize resources by leveraging tools to share curriculum and expand learning. Discovery Club PSP leverages the league paradigm to support fun project based learning through innovation and applied knowledge to promote healthy competition for youth in the greater Los Angeles area. Discovery Club programs and services will serve as a hub for the neighborhood and support: - Connecting Youth Across LA - Building Compassion through Community - Creating Learning through Gamification - Building STEAM Career Pathways",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "According to the LAUSD 2022-2026 strategic plan \"being ready for the world means our students will graduate with the skills and knowledge they need to live out their dreams.\" Discovery Club PSP programs improve access to learning. Youth who are not educationally advanced can participate in league activities that enhance learning and provide access to improved resources. These leagues are a wonderful source of learning but access is limited. Discovery Club PSP leagues provide access to STEAM learning to all youth in the greater Los Angeles area. Through a specifically designed curriculum, RoboQuest, aimed at expanding STEAM learning, youth participate in a top-tier educational experience. The RoboQuest curriculum bridges learning and lays the foundation for successful participation in league activity. This grant provides additional resources to support the successful implementation of programming to improve access to STEAM education for 120 students in the greater Los Angeles area.",

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Public Transit",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Los Angeles continues to have some of the worst air quality, highest rates of childhood asthma, and most severe traffic violence in the country. Streets For All found it unacceptable and built a grassroots team of organizers and advocates from across Los Angeles to help demand the change we so desperately need. We have successfully gotten the city to implement 4.4 miles of Venice Blvd For All, which is set to open this summer. The positive impact of these improvements will be measured by the number of bus boardings each day, reduced bus headways, a reduction in fatalities and injuries of pedestrians and cyclists, and an increase in foot traffic to businesses along the corridor. Streets For All is simply holding the city accountable to its own commitments: Mobility Plan 2035, Vision Zero Action Plan, and the Green New Deal Sustainable City pLAn, all while engaging communities across the city about transportation safety, sustainability, and advocacy.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Venice Boulevard is 13 miles long and is the only street fully within the city of Los Angeles that goes from the ocean to DTLA. From 2012 to 2022, 1,205 collisions occurred on the street and 58 people were killed or seriously injured. The street is more than 2x as wide as other major arterials; it has the capacity to accommodate multiple modes of transportation. The Line 33 bus, which runs along the boulevard, sees 19,500 weekday rides; 93% of riders are people of color and 84% live in households making under $50k/year. A dedicated bus lane can move 5x as many people as a standard traffic lane, improving transit and giving emergency vehicles a path through LA traffic. Recently, a portion of Venice Blvd. was relinquished to the city by Caltrans, along with $14M to bring the street up to a good state of repair. Streets For All successfully got the city to implement 4.4 miles of dedicated bus and protected bike lanes on Venice Blvd. and now we will work to complete the remaining 9 miles.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "A dedicated bus-only lane on Venice Blvd. would make bus trips more efficient and accessible - benefitting more than 20,000 daily riders. Protected bike lanes would help people get to/from the bus and Expo Line safely, providing a great first/last mile solution. Both lanes would improve safety for all that use the street - including those that drive. Additional benefits include increased foot traffic for local businesses, expanded awareness about street safety, and a substantial reduction in the largest source of carbon emissions in California - car trips. If Venice Blvd. were a complete street, it would pave the way (literally and figuratively!) for other streets across the city. The change-making process we're proposing, which includes research, renderings, community engagement, and advocacy, would be replicable for other bus routes and problem areas. Over time, we intend to apply this process to other parts of the city, widely improving public and active transportation.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Streets For All has organized communities, neighborhood councils, and elected officials in an effort to get the city to enact its own mobility plan along Venice Blvd. The mobility plan calls for dedicated bus lanes, pedestrian infrastructure, and protected bike lanes along the corridor. We have created street renderings, a dedicated campaign website, e-mails, and other calls to action to encourage community members to engage. We got neighborhood councils to write letters of support, and organized meetings to advocate for these changes. Our efforts were successful and the city is currently implementing many of our suggestions on 4.4 miles of Venice Boulevard, even using the renderings we provided! With nearly a third of the project implemented, now is the time to extend the dedicated bus lanes and protected bike lanes west to the Pacific Ocean, and east to DTLA. In this second phase, we will host community meetings, pop-up events, present to neighborhood councils, produce new street renderings, and create a video and media campaign to excite people about the proposed improvements. When we first began this campaign, we urged our audience, supporters, and communities across the city - both online and in person - to make public comments through official city channels. We will continue this work with a two-pronged approach: 1) working directly with constituents to build overwhelming and widespread community support, and 2) effectively advocating to key decision-makers.",

The challenges that homeless families face are compounded by the scarcity of affordable housing options. Rental prices have skyrocketed, and the availability of safe, affordable housing is limited in our area. The impact of these challenges can be far-reaching and deeply detrimental. Children are particularly vulnerable in these circumstances, as instability and lack of adequate housing negatively affect their physical health, education, and emotional well-being.

Despite a rapidly aging homeless population (23% are aged 55+), Aging in Place programs are primarily designed to meet the needs of older adults within the general population, and are not refined to meet the unique needs of older adults with histories of homelessness, especially women. Further, although PSH is the leading evidence-based practice for ending chronic homelessness, there are few PSH models that support this population's geriatric needs. With the increasing number of older adults falling into homelessness, and the significant number facing geriatric chronic health conditions, DWC recognized the need to bridge these two approaches to housing stability.",

We couple these services with intensive case management services to ensure that our older adult residents, who represent the majority of women residing at DWC, are able to maintain supportive housing in order to safely age in place. The Aging in Place program is based on the CAPABLE model - an evidence-based practice developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins intended to support residents in nursing homes. CAPABLE relies on an interdisciplinary team consisting of an RN, Occupational Therapist (OT) and OT interns, Social Worker, Case Manager, and a Maintenance Worker to collaboratively assess and address residents' unique, holistic needs. CAPABLE seeks to address physical and mental health barriers that impact the ability to retain housing and decrease hospitalization rates, among other things, for residents in PSH. DWC was the first provider in the nation to introduce this model for PSH. All women identified as candidates are assessed by the RN and OT for chronic health, environment, and ability challenges that may threaten their ability to safely age in place. From this assessment they develop an individualized plan and are connected to appropriate resources. OT interns support with assessments and also provide life-skills workshops for residents.",

DWC measures program success by DWC's on-site Registered Nurse and Occupational Therapist assessing eligible and interested residents for chronic health, environment, and ability challenges that threaten stability, with the goal to connect with 70 women with histories of homelessness each year and provide support tailored to their individual needs. DWC measures qualitative success by the number of women reporting greater satisfaction with their living situation, deepened social connections through participation in enrichment workshops, and lower levels of stress. Our program has proven to be effective; of the women enrolled, 98% retained their housing in 2022, compared to Los Angeles County's average PSH retention rate of 91%."

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "ICAN has a strong track record of providing our clients with jobs they enjoy while ensuring that they earn the income needed to help reduce income inequality. Since 2014, ICAN has helped over 300 clients achieve their dream of a real job at a livable wage. In 2022 alone, 68 clients found new jobs, 76 participated in a job preparation course, 97 participated in job development activities, and 32 achieved their one-year work anniversary. Additionally, the average starting pay was $16 per hour - critical because some people with disabilities still earn as little as 15 cents an hour! Over the years, ICAN has grown to be Harbor Regional Center's (HRC) largest SEP provider. Of the 6 agencies contracted with HRC for Supported Employment, ICAN provides 60% of employment placements. ICAN believes that all people deserve to find meaningful work and purpose in life, and to be paid a fair wage. As such, since our founding, ICAN only places clients in jobs that pay at least minimum wage.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "ICAN's Workforce Training Program provides meaningful employment opportunities for adults with IDD through the following employment initiatives that give our clients the chance to improve their economic situation and gain valuable skills: Supported Employment Program (SEP)-employment opportunities with fading one-on-one job coaching and interview assistance; Partial Work Program (PWP)-work training, work opportunities, along with social development, healthy living, and community integration initiatives that help clients discover more of who they are and what they can do; and Marketplace Initiative-microbusinesses created and operated by ICAN to provide tangible and valuable employment opportunities for clients, including Creative Studio which offers clients the chance to make and sell hand-crafted items with 100% of the proceeds going back to the client. The Workforce Training Program uniquely provides opportunities for clients to gain real life work experience and training while exploring their interests. Clients learn hard- and soft-skills critical to successful employment, such as operating a cash register, taking orders, learning proper sanitation, earning a food handler's certificate as well as interpersonal communication, social awareness, and conflict resolution - skills for good customer service and being an effective employee. ICAN is committed to providing all our clients who desire to work with meaningful employment opportunities paying at or above minimum wage.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Adults with IDD face significant barriers to meaningful employment. The April 2023 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Jobs Report showed that the labor force participation rate for people with disabilities ages 16-64 is 36.9%, in stark comparison to the 75% participation rate for people without disabilities. Furthermore, regardless of the setting in which they work, almost all adults with IDD are underemployed (i.e., not full-time and/or earning less than the minimum wage). Additionally, 73% of our clients' households are low-to-moderate income-but many more face financial hardships raising a child with disabilities. Increasingly, our clients with IDD are being called upon to support the household financially. Employment therefore not only enables individuals with IDD to support essential living expenses for themselves and their family in both the short- and long-term, but it also enables people to have more control over their lives and achieve better integration into community life.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Driven by the core belief that individuals with disabilities should be given the opportunity to live, work, and grow through programs and services of their choice, during the grant period ICAN expects to serve 390 clients through our Workforce Training programs, including helping 80 clients find new jobs, 70 participate in a job preparation course, 120 participate in job development activities, and 35 achieve their one-year work anniversary. Most of our clients are conserved or their parents have power of attorney, and with growing income inequality and increasing housing costs, parents are rightfully concerned over what will happen to their children when the parents can no longer take care of them. As such, ICAN plans to continue innovating, expanding, and enhancing our services to meet the growing needs of our increasing client base now and in the future to ensure that clients have access to the support needed to find and maintain employment and gain independence.",

Connection creates empathy, and empathy drives action. Studies find kids who lack access to natural spaces experience everything from depression, aggression and ailments such as respiratory illnesses. The threats of climate change can be ubiquitous and overwhelming. Lack of tools to confront climate change robs kids of agency. Lacking a workspace to interact with and respond to these threats robs our kids of the real world skills and tools they need to respond to this dynamically changing planet. The LAUSD is our city's biggest landowner and it has excellent access to over 429,000 students. It is perfectly positioned help students develop relationships to our rare and vibrant natural home.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Wild Classroom Project (WCP) is designed specifically to help schools create immersive, curriculum-driven, native habitat classrooms. We have learned that habitat gardens must be properly designed, maintained, and offer a curriculum that embraces the huge diversity of interests our children naturally have. Because they are built for and by students, these nature-based spaces engender stewardship, inspiration, and collaboration. By offering natural respites from the stresses of school they also encourage a rich spectrum of opportunities for learning, The WCP aims to develop environmental citizenship at its core, a shared sense of responsibility for what we call, \"the whole community\" of plants, wildlife and people. The Wild Yards Project understands this work. In late 2019, we designed and installed our first shared school/community garden in Eagle Rock, alongside Colorado Blvd. Known as The E.R.P.C Native Garden, the 4000 sq ft garden is open to the public and has become not just a showcase for our native flora and the countless species of birds, bees and butterflies- but a center for education and enrichment. The garden offers workshops, trails for families to wander, logs and shrouded walkways for kids to roam and solace for those who need to recharge. Since the execution of this garden, the WYP has built 3 more school gardens- improving cross-school (SUBJECT?)curriculum and an emphasis on \"Place\" (valuing where you are?)",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Imagine how powerfully equipped our city would be to solve climate challenges if our students were fluent in biodiversity, water infiltration and carbon sequestration. Native, nature- based classrooms should be as common math classes. Simply put: Our students need agency, not anxiety. Working in nature-based, native gardens replaces helplessness with empowerment, can replace alienation with collaboration, and depression with solace. Our kids already have skin in the game when it comes to dealing with our changing climate and all that implies, so let's give them tools and experiences to build their individual capacities and collective strengths. Currently WYP has 3 school gardens. With the capacity building power of the LA2050 grant, we would be able design, install and supply curriculum and \"maintenance educators\" at 3 more schools in 2023-2024.",

This is because administrators may have moved resources out of the arts budgets & into remedial math & English, in an effort to avoid being placed into program improvement status (Edsource 2014). Ironically, these are the very schools that stand to benefit most from arts programming. Students with access to arts education are 5x less likely to drop out of school, 4x more likely to be recognized for academic achievement, & 4x more likely to receive a bachelor's degree.

Currently, we have seen a dip in our student growth for a number of reasons. Our 3rd and 4th grade classes were deeply affected by the pandemic and did not have the opportunity to develop their social skills during key times of their schooling experience. We also recently renovated our playground and this meant that for the first 3 months of school, our students had indoor recess. This limited their interactions with grade level peers and their ability to develop social-emotional skills. We currently have ideas for how we can accelerate our SEL through play but we need funding in order to best serve our students.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "This grant will help us accelerate SEL through play in a variety of ways. First off, we'd like to hire a certified PE instructor. Currently, each grade level has 1 - 2 \"Go Time\" blocks where students engage in outdoor play. Go Time is led by our Teacher Associates under the supervision of our Director of SEL. They incorporate Playworks into the Go Time structure in order to make sure that students are learning games and usually debrief the game afterward to discuss what made the class feel successful, how they were able to work collaboratively, how they can play competitively but still be inclusive, and how we can make games more fun. While this structure has had positive effects, 2 - 3 adults to supervise 70 - 90 students is hard to manage. Hiring a certified PE coach would help us make our program more effective and bring in the expertise needed to make sure students are getting the most out of Go Time. A PE coach would also free up our Director of SEL to focus more on our Active Citizens. Our Active Citizens are 4th and 5th grade students who demonstrate leadership skills. Being able to support these students further would help create a system where students mentor their younger peers and model the skills needed to have successful relationships with those around them.

Our students would feel more in tune with themselves and their impact on others which would lead to a stronger school community. Students who are able to engage in healthy play and develop connections with each other, have higher academic results and more importantly, a good grasp on their mental health. This effect would be felt by our caregiver community and our students as they learn the SEL skills meant to help them become successful adults. As CWC only goes through 8th grade, the various secondary schools throughout LA County would benefit from our alumni as they serve as role models and leaders within their next school communities and, ideally, continue to live our our mission as true citizens of the world.",

Moving forward, we would like students to take a more specific survey in the beginning of the year to gauge how they are entering the school year and what social emotional skills they feel they have or need. A survey at the end of the year would help us measure what students have learned, what they have benefited from, and what we need to change or reassess. We will also measure our success based on the number of student counseling referrals, suspensions, and interventions we have to put in place in comparison to previous years. We will know that we've been successful when our BIPOC students and students who qualify for free and reduced lunch respond that they feel like they belong in the school community and that they have the skills they need to have healthy relationships. Observationally, our school culture would also reflect that students feel a sense of pride in themselves and their peers."

An estimated 23% has at least one unaddressed mental health need and their children are at risk of poor mental health outcomes (CCJBH,2018, Cochran et al.,2018). Most of FOLA's clients are persons-of-color, unemployed, and living at or below poverty. Many lack access to healthcare which prevents them from receiving mental health services. Even if accessible, few mental health practitioners are familiar with the unique mental health needs of the re-entry community and their families. Services are often limited to individual therapy even though couples and family therapy are associated with improved mental health within families and reduced recidivism (Spjeldnes et al.,2012 & Fahmy,2021)(Cochran et al., 2018). Finally, by addressing their mental health needs, re-entry job-seekers are more likely to obtain and retain employment, resulting in increased financial stability for them and their families.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The project team will measure impact as follows: Therapists will administer individual pre-/post-evaluations with participants, assessing for changes in the participant's use of adaptive coping skills, increased perception of social support, improved familial/social relationships, and attitude about therapy. The therapists will analyze the quantitative data on a quarterly basis to measure the impact of the intervention, the results of which will be used as needed to modify the service delivery. Focus groups conducted at the midpoint and end of the project will yield qualitative data that will be used to understand the factors that contributed to the participants' success.

The project will begin with a training for FOLA staff by Silegra during which the project and processes will be discussed. FOLA staff will be trained to talk about the topic of mental health with their participants and will learn how to make referrals so as to ensure the participant's sense of safety. Silegra's licensed therapists will receive referrals from FOLA staff and contact participants to arrange for a first meeting during which the participant's needs and hopes for therapy will be discussed. A pre-evaluation will be conducted. In an effort to make therapy as accessible as possible, sessions will be conducted in the evening or on Saturday at a FOLA office or via Zoom based on the participants' individual preferences. The average number of sessions provided per participant will be 10 - 12, based on individual needs and the therapist's clinical judgment, and will conclude with a post-evaluation. Participants who complete 5 sessions will receive a $50 gift card; those who complete 10 sessions will also receive a $100 gift card. In an effort to educate the community about the mental health needs of the re-entry population and their families, FOLA will host quarterly public workshops which feature subject matter experts on topics such as the mental health stressors of the re-entry population and their families.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Vision for success/intended impact: (1) a minimum of 25 justice-impacted individuals and their families will receive mental health therapy. 75% (19) of these individuals will report an improvement in their mental health; (2) increased knowledge amongst practitioners and service providers about the mental health needs of this target group. Plans for scaling: Historically, FOLA has assisted participants with their mental health needs by linking them to outside services. Challenges include that participants do not pursue services because of the stigma associated with the services, unaffordable services, mistrust/not knowing the service provider, and inconvenient service locations. PSA will bring services in-house and lay a foundation to address participants' mental health needs through an internal network. Establishing a history of providing services will open the door for FOLA to pursue other funding opportunities so it can include mental health services in future programs."

What is the evidence that this program will be successful? First, this is an initiative of SoCal CAN, a collaborative of 150 local college access and success organizations. We work with 250,000 low-income, first-generation students annually, helping them to get into college and to succeed in getting degrees. Nationally only 11 percent of low-income, first-generation students graduate from college; in our network, we have achieved a success rate of 89 percent. Another indicator of success is a similar initiative we developed: Project SOAR. Because of its success in helping public housing students get into college, SOAR has been acclaimed as a national model.

But, economic hardship struck his family. Both of his parents had lost their jobs, which forced him to pause his college plans and start working more hours at the local supermarket to help pay rent and buy food. Jerome's story is not uncommon. It is the story of thousands of Angelenos who had to step away from their college and career dreams during the pandemic. Some of the steepest declines in enrollment were at the nine campuses in the Los Angeles Community College District which lost 28% of its total enrollment, with 32% decline for Latinx students and 40% decline for Black students. While a small number have returned to campus in recent years, the vast majority have not. Research shows that once students step away from their college plans, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to come back. It is imperative that we act now.",

For those who had to leave behind their plans for higher education during the pandemic, this program will send the message that \"College is possible,\" and that support is available. The second element is unique: There will be a team of Comeback Navigators who will work directly with these former students who want to return to college. These Navigators all have a similar lived experience to the people with whom they are working. They too were once forced to leave school due to economic challenges. Fortunately, with support, they were able to return and complete their college degrees. Now they plan to pay it forward; they help students complete all the paperwork to return to college, assist them through any difficulties, and connect them with essential resources on campus to ensure they will succeed. The third element recognizes that it takes a village to make this initiative to succeed. The program enlists the help of K-12 and higher ed institutions to work to re-enroll as many students as possible. What makes us confident that this is the best way to address the problem? While LA's College Comeback is a pilot for our organization, it's based on a successful program in Riverside County that re-enrolled 200 students back into college.

Of these, we plan to work with 400 students in the first year - young people who had to postpone their college aspirations due to financial hardship during the pandemic. By October 2024, we expect that each of these students will have either re-enrolled or developed a plan for re-enrollment in college. The long term vision of success is for these 400 young students to come back to college, to receive the support they need, and to graduate. If this pilot is successful, we can replicate the model for thousands, more students over the next decade. The intended impact is to help thousands of young people and their families to attain upward economic mobility. Higher education levels are linked to better earnings, steadier employment and more opportunities to climb the socioeconomic ladder.

Current 'pay to play' models exclude many children from low-income backgrounds, with the cost of joining a team ranging from $600 to $2,500. This deprives them of the physical and social benefits of sports but also opportunities for athletic scholarships or sports careers. Lack of access to organized sports can lead to a higher propensity for unproductive or risky behavior. For example, we remember, a 12-year-old from a low-income neighborhood, who had come up to the booth and stated that he really loves to play Futsal soccer but couldn't afford to play until LA Active Sports provide our help. We believe that every child, like the boy that approached us, should have equal opportunities to play, regardless of their economic status. Failure to address this issue risks perpetuating a cycle of inequality, limiting potential, and adversely affecting community health",

Beyond sports participation, our success would lead to improved physical health, and emotional well-being among the youth. Our participants would carry these beneficial experiences into adulthood, influencing their overall life outcomes positively. We see LA Active Sports becoming a role model for other sports organizations in addressing income inequality, inspiring them to adopt similar models of inclusivity.

    "summary": "WOW is developing a pilot program, Financial Citizenship for Youth, which delivers accessible, interesting, and engaging financial literacy content to youth ages 6-10. Our goal is to create confidence and understanding around 'money math' so that children begin to learn the importance of managing money. We turn the \"M\" in \"STEM\" into MONEY, not just MATH to highlight the connection between math and money for children who are learning multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In 2010, a U.S. Department of Education study found that 80 % of high school dropouts cited difficulties in math as the primary reason for leaving school (32% of teens can't identify the difference between a credit card and a debit card) and the D.O.E. has partnered with financial institutions, consumer groups, and other government agencies in this effort to create change. California's State Superintendents partnered with several organizations to launch financial literacy awareness in schools. By launching our financial citizenship program, WOW can raise awareness alongside these organizations to make a larger impact on the community. With additional funding and partnerships, we will be able to reach and educate more families and shift the patterns and behaviors of poverty, debt, homelessness, and financial illiteracy. Financial education that lifts families out of poverty, away from abuse and financial strain and changes entire ecosystems, family dynamics, and generations.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "K-12 STEAM Education",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "An epidemic is present in the US; financial awareness is missing in most homes and financial education is absent from most schools. Financial literacy is a complex concept, encompassing multiple aspects related to how individuals manage their resources and engage in financial decision-making while shifting future generations ahead. Only 16% of Americans between ages 18-26 are optimistic about their financial future. The lack of financial education is creating a financial literacy crisis, many American don't earn enough to save or don't save at all. Almost 3/4 of teens lack confidence in their financial ability, 73% want to learn more. With the lack of knowledge, nearly half of teenagers know about investing from social media and receiving false and misinformation. As a combination of debt management, budgeting, and investing, financial literacy is vital for making responsible financial decisions; when buying a home, funding children's education, or ensuring a comfortable retirement.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The National Financial Educators Council asked 1,101 young adults aged 18-24 \"What high school-level course would benefit your life the most?\" The majority (51.4%) responded \"money management\" as the high school-level course they thought would be most beneficial to their personal lives. Topics our pilot will cover include an opening conversation about value (what is value?, How do we decide if something is 'worth' what it costs?), building a basic budget (what are some ways you could INCREASE your budget), and writing and cashing a check (have you ever done this before? Have you ever seen anyone else do this before? Who?, How much would you like to make every week when you grow up?). We then have children write themselves a new check, made out to themselves, for the amount they specifically want to make when they grow up x 2. We then ask them to visualize themselves making at least this much or more when they get their first job. This is basic, simple material but powerful knowledge at its core. When we want to create massive change in our culture, we need to start with the parents to teach them the skills required to educate themselves and pass this knowledge to their children, creating change for generations upon generations. 4 out 5 parents wish they learned more about money as a kid, offering a course to children will empower them to create their own change and encourage their parents to take action, sparking an entire movement.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "At the beginning of each workshop, we will deliver a questionnaire for each student to complete that will include questions about their current financial IQ and confidence. After the workshop, we will measure success through comprehensive tests, questionnaires and re-connect with each participant (along with their parents) to ask about actions that have been taken, i.e. opening bank accounts in their child's name. One powerful exercise we previously completed with the Downtown Women's Shelter of L.A. was asking the participants to write a letter to themselves about where they see themselves in 1 year. We ask them to be detailed and candid and dream big! We will then hold those letters for them and mail them back in one year so they can see in their own words how they have achieved their goals. This showcases the work we have done to build the whole person, inside and out."

LA fails at this, but not for lack of money: the system is broken and doesn't deliver the services we deserve. That's why we're leading LA's first community-informed, citywide, long-term infrastructure budget.

We will assess the City of LA's progress toward being open to implementing a City-adopted version. To measure the long-term outcomes, we have a tool already in place. We just published the only existing inventory of City public right-of-way assets, including those mentioned in this application. That is our baseline. We will update the inventory and compare future numbers to today's numbers to track the City's progress toward adding more trees, lighting, bathrooms, etc. We have plenty of evidence that a Capital Infrastructure Plan is possible. We researched CIPs from 30+ other cities, and have studied them to learn how they're created and how other cities incorporate public input. We are targeting engagement activities to hear from diverse voices across LA. We will keep track of the geography and other demographics to make sure we're meeting that goal.",

Reliability: 44% said the bus did not arrive when they thought it would Bus stop conditions: Nearly half were dirty, 27% lacked shade Accessibility: In more than half, there was at least 1 person using a mobility device. Yet, 8 stops lacked accessible boarding, 21 had narrow sidewalks, and 19 felt too close to moving cars There's no transit without shade, lighting, ramps, bathrooms and more. LA has at least $1 billion/year for these assets, but no long-term budget. A Capital Infrastructure Plan is a community-informed, budgeted plan. We are creating one as a model, institutionalizing a new participatory budgeting process for LA. Why now: new mayor prioritizing public works, new federal infrastructure money, and 2028 Olympic infrastructure planning.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "1-Year: We will have a community-informed Capital Infrastructure Plan (CIP) for LA's sidewalks and streets. Our model CIP will show how equity can be applied to budget decisions. We'll have demonstrated a participatory budgeting process that LA can institutionalize. Our model CIP will move the Mayor and Council to implement a city-adopted CIP. We'll have generated an intersectional vision for LA's sidewalks and streets, and awareness that transit is more than buses and transportation is more than the roadbed. Long-Term: More functional assets like shade, lighting, ramps, crosswalks, etc., and fewer broken assets. A CIP clarifies what projects are being considered, making it possible for people to have a voice. This distributes power among people who have not been able to participate in decisions about their own communities. LA will have a transparent process ensuring public investments prioritize neighborhoods that have borne multi-generational systemic racism and disinvestment.",

The more we increase and amplify community input on infrastructure priorities, the more informed, powerful, and widely supported our campaign for LA's first Capital Infrastructure Plan (CIP) becomes. That signals to the Mayor and City Council that investing in LA's sidewalks and streets with a real equitable strategy is a citywide priority. We will accomplish this by 1) engaging Angelenos where they're at via community events to learn about their infrastructure priorities, 2) hosting \"Infrastructure for the People\" Luncheons with community-based organizations and civic leaders to elevate community infrastructure priorities and identify best practices for developing and institutionalizing LA's first CIP, 3) hosting workshops and trainings centered around why LA needs a CIP and how to join us in creating the first for LA, 4) engaging with LA's City and Neighborhood Councils network and constituents to ensure that our data on community infrastructure priorities are reflective of the demographic and socio-economic landscape of LA, and 5) conducting media-based organizing to promote awareness of our campaign and empower Angelenos to join us in creating a better future for LA's streets and sidewalks."

County is generously providing a daily stipend of $110 per unit but it falls short of our actual costs. Thanks to strong community support of nearly $200,000, we are closing this funding gap. We would like to request a grant of $75,000 to help complete the funding for this remarkable outreach.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "According to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, (LAHSA) an estimated 69,144 people experienced homelessness in Los Angeles County during 2022. 32% of this population are women and 16% are in family units, usually headed by a single mother. That's over 11,000 homeless moms and kids! For these mothers facing the trauma of homelessness, it can be overwhelming. It's nearly impossible to think about finding a job or building a new life when you don't know where your next meal is coming from or where you will spend the night. For the women and children that will be welcomed at Hope the Mission shelters, they will find help, hope, immediate care and long-term rehabilitation services so they will never be homeless again.",

The Skid Row Running Club focuses on providing a community for individuals seeking to overcome substance abuse and achieving positive life goals through the power of running. Some challenges our runners face relate to lack of education, employment skills, housing stability and means to achieve their goals. Other challenges some of our members face due to their personal experiences include health and well-being, confidence, and self-worth. Our runners have found that the shared journey to train for a marathon creates meaningful relationships and brings out the commonality we all have as humans, whether we are homeless, financially wealthy, a police officer, a superior court judge, or someone formerly-incarcerate. Our runners work together to inspire each other in running and in life in building a better community. We believe in: \"if you want to run far, run together\".",

Participants will be homeless, at-risk for homelessness, or low-income and be a regular member of the running club for a pre-determined amount of time The Small Grants Program by Skid Row Running Club (Small Grants Program) will require the participant to complete certain milestones over their time in the program, including 6 months of marathon training, completion of LA Marathon, attendance at an overnight trip and race with the Club to experience new locales, cultures and people, develop and lead a community service event, obtain at least part-time employment, and participation in a sobriety program and wellness program. The pillars of our running program focus on how running can improve your health, build a community, and take you places you may not have dreamed were possible. We also want our participants to see the value of giving back to the community. Small grant funds will be provided to the individual based on their specific needs to assist with such items as a deposit for housing or purchase of furniture, vehicle down payment, educational needs such as tuition or training, or employment needs such as license costs, tools, or union dues. We believe these small grants will aid our participants with overcoming some of the barriers into becoming financially stable."

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "West Adams is a historically Black neighborhood with a rich cultural history and significance which is under threat by rapid gentrification. Enabling us to continue our work would allow people to stay in the neighborhoods where they have roots and learn the tools ro advocate for themselves and others long after their contact with us. The very identity of West Adams, and therefore the diversity and cultural landscape of Los Angeles county, is at stake. If these people are pushed out, like so many others have been in Boyle Heights, Chavez Ravine, Echo Park, and more, West Adams will become just another strip of shiny restaurants with $30 small plates and coffee shops selling $8 espressos, the rich, unique cultural history swept aside for more of what we already have so much of.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "We know that expanding our free food programs will keep money in the pockets of families with other bills to pay and enable people to become more secure in keeping up with their housing costs. At present due to cost they occur once a week but could expand to as many as three times per week. A large vehicle would also expand this capacity. We will also be able to expand the assistance that we offer to our unhoused neighbors. We currently accept mail on the behalf of a few individuals, allowing them to receive critical documents such as medical correspondence, ID cards, insurance documents, and more. With funding we could install mailboxes to be able to serve a larger number of people while preserving their sensitive documents in a more secure manner. We also keep a reserve fund to pay for tents, supplies, and even motel stays in the case of inclement weather. Expanding this reserve would enable us to help even more people survive. We currently rely heavily on donations to supply medical supplies to our free pop-up clinics, which provides routine check-ups and preventative care all across Los Angeles semi-weekly. With funding we could make sure these clinics are better supplied to solve a greater variety of issues. Lastly but perhaps most critically, we are ourselves not immune to rising costs. An LA Times article featured us and tells more about our struggles to stay in the community where we have put down roots. A rainy day fund for our rent would be beneficial.",

While we must rely on anecdotal reports of where that saved money is spent, we have many testimonies from neighbors that the money they are able save on groceries because of our distributions is critical in keeping afloat. We have provided direct rental assistance to 3 individuals, directly preventing their eviction. The attached video includes direct statements from neighbors we have assisted. The Los Angeles Tenants union has meetings twice a month in our space, and the turn-out has led to the creation of another subdivision for this area to better and more specifically address members' concerns. Our amazing nurses have volunteered 400+ hours bringing healthcare to the underserved all across Los Angeles, identifying problems early and saving potentially thousands of dollars in medical bills and hundreds more in miscellaneous medical supplies.",

We understand on an intimate level the personal struggles of our neighbors in the face of rising rents, limited options because of credit scores or financial history, abusive or neglectful landlords, and the difficulty of navigating the bureaucracy of government programs. On a systemic level, we have organized with the Los Angeles Tenants Union to educate ourselves and our community about their legal rights and protections, and to lobby for better policy for renters at risk of homelessness. We know that many renters find themselves in situations where as little as $200 separates them from living on the streets--we know this because we have on several occasions supplied the $200 to keep them from eviction. We have also worked directly with landlords on the behalf of our neighbors to establish payment plans or other alternative arrangements."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Many people view homelessness as a major problem in Los Angeles, a city where more than 69,000 residents lack housing. The problem affects the neighborhoods and communities in which the homeless occupy, but mostly it affects the homeless people themselves. There are already many services available for the homeless in Los Angeles, providing health care, food, even temporary and long-term shelter, but the number of homeless keeps growing. From 2015-2022 LA county PEH increased by 56%, becoming the largest homeless population in the country, overtaking New York City, which had an 18% decline. This trend is tied to cultural evolution, economic limitations, social development, and our educational and mental health systems. Many factors lead to homelessness and the best solutions can emerge by getting to the root of the matter.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "NMA is developing a unique way to spread awareness and get to the root of the problem by interviewing homeless people for cash. NMA staff, volunteers, and eventually a network of like-minded solution-finders will pay panhandlers $1 per minute for a video interview, with the purpose of discovering what really matters to them and what would make a lasting difference. These interviews will then be posted on a new website HireTheHomeless.com as a national resource, and also condensed and used in a live theatrical production in Los Angeles by the NMA ensemble to raise awareness about the issue. The production will pair the modern-day interviews with an ancient Aristophanes play, Plutus, to explore the similarities and differences of the issue of poverty and homelessness through time. Not Man Apart is always interested in giving a voice to underrepresented populations, and what better way than to empower and dignify the homeless population of Los Angeles with cash payments for their contributions. To that end, a select few interested homeless individuals will be invited to participate in the show creation and performance in Los Angeles. NMA is interested in advocating for social change through the arts, we believe this innovative approach will do more than create content for our new website and theatrical production, but expose the roots of the cultural issue of homelessness on a local, national, and global level.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The first measure of success will be to establish the operation of HireTheHomeless.com and launch the website with initial interview examples. From here the promotion of the site and increased traffic/participation can be measured, we would like to receive over 2000 5-minute video interviews, which will inject over $10000 of direct, dignified support into the homeless community of Los Angeles. We would like this funding and target to increase as the project continues through a global network. Next, the editing of these interviews into concise documentary videos and sound bites that can be used in a live performance and also posted as promotion and advocacy to community stakeholders. The creation and devising of the performance using these interviews, using the Ancient Greek play, Plutus, will be a concrete measure of success, with a performance schedule and measurable audience attendance. Public officials and organization leaders will be invited to participate in solution discussions.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles will be different from this project because the homeless population will be hired and helped, but most importantly listened to and given an empowered voice. The general communities of Los Angeles (and specifically the law makers and invested service organizations) will be invited to attend the resulting NMA performance to offer new perspectives and solutions to the issue. Finally, through HireTheHomeless.com, the whole country and global community will be more educated and informed about the root of homelessness and be inspired to answer calls to action. Apart from the immediate cash payments and direct creative opportunities to the homeless community presented in this project, we hope that the real change to Los Angeles will be a qualitative improvement over time and reduce the number of people living on the streets, by discovering the important matters to address and connecting the people to address them."

The C11 program aims to change these statistics with strategies for building strengths and resources for the future. Our goal is to create a culture where students build their leadership skills, are excited about college, and given the tools to be successful. Research shows that low-income students engaged in service tend to have a greater commitment to learning, better school attendance, grades, and academic success.

Creating an inclusive college-bound culture for first generation college students, our projects offer an immersive dive into student's own character traits, motivations and causes they believe in. We offer professional college advisors for one-on-one mentoring who help find the right college fit, navigating the application and financial aid process and building interview skills, which is also applicable beyond college for resumes and ultimately careers. This gives TJNFF students a competitive edge against more affluent students whose parents can afford a college support network. The results are students who are motivated to attend college, are able to recognize their power to change injustices and the plan and the motivation to succeed in college. A key program element is our entrepreneurial service project that the senior club leaders complete with the support of their fellow club members. They begin with a needs assessment within their own school or community, and devise a solution. Thrive in Joy provides both financial support and mentorship to carry out their project. We also bring in community partners to further support their efforts. Through this, they learn effective planning, project management, training volunteers and budgeting, as they are responsible for all aspects from inception to completion.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "A key measurement of the program's success is the personally, academic and social achievements through improved skills and project work.

These results exemplify the power of the C11 program but moreso, the success is shown in the entrepreneurial social impact projects conceptualized and managed by students, addressing a need in their community.

CPAF works to recruit, train, and mentor youth to amplify youth voices and ensure they continue to inform the project. With such a powerful impact on youth aged 13-18, CPAF anticipates that these empowered young people will go on to thrive in colleges and careers empowered as active agents of change, making a lasting impact on their households, their cultural communities, and the County they call home.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "CPAF, with external consultant support, has been developing meaningful, culturally grounded and community-centered evaluation methods, with a specific focus on the \"Rooted Leadership\" program, where desired outcomes include: 1) Leadership development 2) Recognition of what participants learned 3) Enhanced peer connectedness 4) Increased community connection 5) Strengthened adult/youth relationships 6) Increased conflict resolution (communication, boundary setting, principles of non-violence) 7) Signs of self-empowerment/agency Over 240 youth engaged with CPAF's prevention program over the past 3 years. CPAF's work in equipping/mobilizing youth leaders (https://nurturingchange.org/rooted-leaders-digital-portfolios) has been publicly acknowledged as a valuable model (https://cpaf.me/CalHealthReport; https://cpaf.me/YouthLeadPodcast).

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Youth in LA County Asian/PI communities face numerous barriers to building safe communities and a future protected from violence, including dating, domestic, and sexual violence. Preventing these forms of violence requires proactive conversations about sexuality and intimate relationships, but these are often taboo topics within Asian/PI families. A recent study of LA County Asian/PI youth confirmed they are uncomfortable speaking to their parents about intimate relationships and are more likely to turn to their peers or adult allies for information or help. When intimate relationships start to become unhealthy, the cultural stigma around avoiding shame (\"losing face\") can further inhibit the open discussions which help prevent harm from relationship violence. Moreover, anti-immigrant rhetoric and polices, coupled with rising anti-Asian hate, is making public engagement an increasingly unsafe endeavor for their communities, further inhibiting the work to prevent and end violence."

    "summary": "To celebrate Zocalo's 20th birthday we are embarking on What Connects Us, a robust series of programs and digital content that will introduce new approaches to the critical conversations Zocalo is known for, catalyzed by cultural experiences. The series will feature a kaleidoscope of perspectives on the ideas, places, and questions that are central to the approachable intellectual space Zocalo has created in Los Angeles, and, like everything we do, will be entirely free and open to the public, with as few barriers to participation as possible.",
    "goal": "CREATE",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Success for What Connects Us will mean a better-connected L.A. County, with people and organizations from across its vast spread having met and exchanged ideas and perspectives. The ultimate aim is to build civic pride and cohesion around a shared vision of L.A.'s future. We are celebrating 20 years of Zocalo creating a space for Angelenos to come together and reflect on big issues and ideas. Success will mean sparking new discussions around where we want Los Angeles to be 20 years from now, and what the city needs for its people and cultural organizations to get there. In the immediate term, we anticipate vibrant content, shared across many platforms by many people and organizations, and a rich section on our website that is a resource for many; we estimate 1,500 attendees at in-person events and over 53,500 reading and watching online. In the long term, we expect our work will help L.A. feel like its problems are not insurmountable-and together we have the capacity to solve them.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "At Zocalo's founding in 2003, the public square was under threat from technology, social stratification, and the idea that more and more Americans were \"bowling alone.\" Today's dangers to the public square are more insidious and complex, but also more readily visible. In Los Angeles, we see them in rising inequality, in mistrust in our leaders, and in our challenges surmounting a host of problems with any kind of consensus, from climate change to improving education. But over the past two decades, as the public sphere became ever more polarized, segregated, and mean, Zocalo has pulled hard in the other direction, creating a welcoming public space where people of vastly different backgrounds, experiences, and expertises learn from each other. What Connects Us will ask: What conversations can bring Angelenos together? What ideas can provoke curiosity and cultivate greater cohesion? What questions can spark solutions to the gravest, most deeply rooted issues we face?",

And we track the readership of individual pieces, the open rates and traffic of our email newsletters, social media reach, and overall website traffic. In addition to raw numbers, we continually assess audience diversity (ethnic, geographic, educational, economic). We review the makeup of our online audiences and survey our online and in-person audiences for demographic information. What Connects Us also will measure its success in how well it engages Angelenos who are new to Zocalo, and in our project's impact on the tenor and content of the discourse around Los Angeles today. We know that Zocalo discussions often reverberate beyond our walls, and we anticipate that What Connects Us will help create a city that is more compassionate, optimistic, and cohesive.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "What Connects Us is a Zocalo Inquiry-a signature programs series and digital content package focused on a single theme, and housed on a dedicated section of Zocalo's website. This Inquiry will explore a broad range of subjects, including the question of how to bring Angelenos together in conversation about the most urgent issues of our time. Free programs will take place across L.A. County in partnership with a broad range of cultural organizations and collaborators, many of which will also be event locations. They include LA Plaza Cocina in Downtown L.A., Destination Crenshaw in Leimert Park, WasteLAnd and Raven Chacon, the Kinsey African American Art & History Collection at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, USC Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, and Mythili Prakash. The organizations we are working with span food, visual art, urban planning, performance, and more in order to reflect the diversity of Los Angeles County, and to bring as many perspectives and voices into the conversation as possible. Our digital content package features a three-part series of essays and commissioned artwork that explores the past, present, and future of the public square and of Los Angeles. It will include short, scholarly takes from thought leaders, pieces in conversation with classic Zocalo content, and a blend of essays with embedded visuals and audio to explore place, community, and history."

From 2019 to 2020 alone, suicide rates amongst kids aged 10-18 increased by 20% and in California, over 284,000 youth deal with depression with over 66% of these youth who do not receive any help. (see LACOE, 2023) In our organization alone, at least 95% of youth who have entered our programs have come in with one or more mental and emotional disturbance in their lives. Upon surveying our youth, we have found that a number of factors contribute to these disturbances, including but not limited to: poor living conditions due to poverty, absence of either one or both parents, lack of access to physical and/or expressive activities, domestic abuse in the household, and continual \"addiction\" to social media.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "With an increase in accessibility to the arts and a decrease in mental and emotional health issues amongst our youth, we envision a more vibrant Los Angeles filled with young creatives and leaders who are also passionate about serving the communities they come from. Our youth will become strong young leaders who are ready to use their own personal experiences as a means to impact the next generation. As leaders, our youth will advocate further for the well-being of those negatively impacted by poor mental health and poverty, creating a new generational wave of healing and opportunity. As creatives, arts accessibility will increase as the youth who complete our internship and become Teaching Artists/Mentors will be able to lead at different sites throughout the city to continue bringing high-quality dance classes, especially into regions that lack it. Los Angeles will continue its standing as a diverse city where all career options, even those in the arts, are viable and sustainable.",

We have measured our impact through three different metrics: 1) attendance and participation, 2) qualitative feedback, and 3) student retention. Time and again, students have returned to our program consistently and have reported a number of changes in themselves, including increased: positivity in their thinking, motivation for school, and confidence in themselves. As such one student reported the following: \"There isn't a day that goes by where I don't contemplate the impact Outkast has had on my life. Every time I think about Outkast, I think of hope. I am always left in awe that there are people in the world who are willing to give a portion of their time to the youth.

Classes consist of warm-ups, training exercises, team-building activities, and choreography training in a variety of dance styles.

Our team of Teaching Artists/Mentors head our classes and we also partner with local LA-based artists to bring their training and diverse backgrounds to our youth. In doing so, we expose them to professional opportunities in dance and offer a pipeline where graduating students can pursue an arts career by completing our internship and becoming a paid staff member to teach. To bind our programming altogether, we focus on integrating a mentorship curriculum suited for developing our youth's character and leadership, while our Teaching Artists/Mentors build steady and trusting relationships with them to help guide them through tough circumstances that can deteriorate their attention from growing.",

The workshop series allows participants to engage in immersive learning opportunities, connect and learn from working creatives, and gain a deeper sense of the direction they wish to pursue. Interns contribute to various projects including product development, creative marketing and social media, event planning, and participate in ongoing professional development such as finance for creatives, project management, and self-care strategies.

The program will cultivate opportunities for up to 120 people annually who may or may not be active in creative fields to ideate and reimagine solutions unique to their own context. In an age of increasing automation and the prevalence of artificial intelligence the need to uplift critical and creative thinkers is more important than ever.

In the most competitive market with the highest cost of living in the U.S., L.A. has the largest TAY population. To compound challenges facing TAY as they \"age out,\" the cost of furnishings and household goods is higher than ever, stretching their extremely limited means even further. The latest consumer price index shows that household furnishing costs jumped by 9.3% year over year. \"Furniture poverty\" is the inability to afford household furniture or home goods essential to achieving the most basic standard of living. With no furniture and no financial means to attain any, they and their children sleep, sit, study and eat on bare floors. Unsurprisingly, research shows that this lack of fundamental home furnishings directly contributes to homelessness, housing instability, and perpetuates the cycle of poverty.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "For most youth who have endured the foster system, home is neither safe nor secure. While other organizations exist to support foster youths' transition to independence, no other organization provides critical support every step of the way for TAY to obtain, fully furnish, and maintain stable supportive housing. ASOH partners with L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to help TAY secure housing vouchers. ASOH is the only organization that partners with DCFS to directly refer former foster youth for rapid re-housing services and expedited housing assistance. Once TAY youth receive the keys to their apartment, ASOH turns their empty space into a functioning and inspired home. At Home Creations, our team works with volunteers to collect everything needed at our warehouse to fully furnish the homes and load the delivery truck. Then 15-25 volunteers meet at the youth's new home, where they unload the truck and furnish the home within 90 minutes. A celebratory lunch follows, with the recipient youth telling their story and volunteers sharing their hopes for the recipient. Every participant gets the opportunity to volunteer to create another home, learn from healthy role models, and are invited to become peer mentors joining our \"Pay it Forward Alumni\" (PIFA) Community. We also provide TAY with critical connections to ongoing mentorship, gainful employment, therapy/wellness services, parenting skills, and support to succeed in school and in their careers.",

The ASOH model provides the basic necessities - a 250 + item \"home kit\" designed and lovingly installed by the ASOH community - for an individual to improve their life and a home environment that transforms and inspires youth to achieve their academic and professional goals. An LA2050 grant will bolster our core programming at a crucial time when TAY are facing a heightened risk of homelessness due to conditions exacerbated by the pandemic. We recently hired a Community Resource Navigator to solidify referrals with community partners, provide case management, and connect TAY with job-readiness/placement resources, therapy/wellness services, parenting, life skills workshops, and all the tools to thrive. This grant will be pivotal to supporting our program expansion by deepening the impact of our comprehensive resource services.",

A testament to our impact, 93% of youth have maintained their tenancy after five years. Our services are only successful if the homes we create result in the long-term tenancy, success, and well-being of our recipients. Gathering both quantitative and qualitative data, we keep in close touch with home recipients and track progress toward their educational and vocational goals, in addition to home retention. We administer pre- and post-questionnaires, created by early attachment specialist Dr. Victoria Stevens, for youth recipients to measure emotional intelligence, life skills, hope, and self-worth.

This program will be implemented in partnership with local mosques that are attended by immigrants and refugees. Mosques will provide outreach to the immigrant communities and will host trainings. Each training unit consists of three sessions. The topics covered during those sessions are: 1.\tBuilding Identity 2.\tUnderstanding Stereotypes, Culture, and Knowledge 3.\tNavigating the American Context 4.\tConnecting Cultural Roots 5.\tEngaging Civically 6.\tDeveloping Community Organizing By the end of the training unit, students will be able to understand the value of building identity from personal experiences, to explore the social and political context of American life, and gain practical tools to become leaders who are equipped to create beneficial change in their communities.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Participants of the Gamechangers trainings will engage in hands-on activities such as creating posters and giving presentations on researched bills and relevant information. These activities will allow the trainers to gauge the participants' understanding of the content presented in the sessions. Furthermore, students will be given pre- and post- surveys to measure the program's effect on its attendees. The surveys ask students to rate their understanding of the various topics presented during the training sessions (e.g. how to effectively engage different levels of government, how stereotypes can negatively impact people, etc.). The surveys also allow students to indicate which aspects of the sessions were most beneficial, which aspects needed improvement, and any suggestions on how to improve the program.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Immigrant and Refugee Support",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "For immigrant adolescents in the US, balancing American culture with their ethnic culture can be a difficult endeavor. Many children struggle to reconcile between the two differing sets of values, beliefs, and traditions that exist within and outside their household. This dissonance may lead to an identity crisis that causes feelings of confusion, isolation, and loneliness. These issues are compounded by xenophobia and Islamophobia in schools. According to a CAIR survey of Muslim students in 2021, over half of respondents reported feeling unsafe, unwelcome, or uncomfortable at school because of their Muslim identity. Navigating such challenges in a new, unfamiliar environment has resulted in students feeling lost and powerless. This has inhibited them from being able to productively engage with their communities and confidently create positive change. Yet CAIR-LA knows that with the right tools, these immigrant students can be gamechangers in both social and political spheres.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "CAIR-LA will partner with Hawthorne Mosque and Lomita Mosque to recruit and enroll immigrant high school age students to the Gamechangers program. These two mosques will collaborate with other immigrant-majority mosques in Southern California to recruit students using various methods, including but not limited to social media outreach, distributing flyers and posters, posting links on their websites, and Friday prayer announcements. Gamechanger sessions will be held at the mosques. CAIR-LA may partner with other mosques in the duration of this grant. Due to the wide geographical span of the LA region, we've centralized programming to these particular areas due to larger immigrant populations",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "California is the most ethnically and racially diverse state in the country. The percentage of foreign-born residents in California is double the rest of the country. Nearly half of all children (48%) in California have at least one immigrant parent. In Los Angeles, that percentage shoots up to nearly 60%. As such, the wellbeing of immigrants will determine the future of LA. By implementing this program, immigrant youth in LA will be empowered with the knowledge and tools to enact change and present solutions to the pressing needs of LA's most vulnerable communities. This will help build a stronger democracy and a stronger LA. The program is scalable to multiple locations. With more funding, we will be able to hold more trainings to benefit more students. The numbers listed in the direct beneficiaries section (90 students) are a conservative estimate of the attendees in the three training units that will occur during the grant period.",

However, many Los Angeles residents are unfamiliar with-or have misconceptions about-the CFP, our Mediterranean-type climate, and the remarkable wildlife surrounding us. As we face increasing threats from climate change, we urgently need to develop shared, public ecological awareness and stewardship, especially amongst future generations. Native plants are integral to addressing the challenges of carbon emissions, water scarcity, air pollution, rising temperatures, and biodiversity loss. By integrating native plant education across multiple areas of the curriculum in LA public schools, this proposal instills plant awareness, promotes ecological understanding, and empowers the youth of Los Angeles to create meaningful environmental change in our region.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "We are proposing a multi-tiered toolkit to be shared with schools across Los Angeles, which serves to shape and deepen understanding about the unique and important plants that have formed Los Angeles, culturally and ecologically. The first tier in the program is a free, bilingual plant-identification poster, entitled \"The Plants Around You,\" to be hung in classrooms and school offices, that shares the common and important native plants of Southern California with students, educators, parents and school administrators. The poster would be provided to educators at no cost, and paired with a plant identification guide, dissolving barriers to plant recognition. Connecting to the poster, TPF will host four 90-minute webinars with up to 1,000 attendees each, which will be archived on the teacher resource page at theodorepayne.org. Each webinar will use a standards-based approach to demonstrate how to teach about California native plants across disciplines (Math and ELA for grades K-5, Science and the Arts for grades 6-12). Building off of the webinars, TPF will host a two-day, in-person cohort targeted at teachers at Title I schools via an application process. This summer training will consist of hands-on training, coaching teachers on integrating native plant knowledge into their teaching.

The program will be taught at California State University Dominguez Hills and will be supplemented with STEM relevant field trips including a week-long Summer Marine Science Camp in August. The high school Saturday Science Program curriculum with alternate on a single STEM topic the first half of the 7-month period and a second topic the second half. Instructors will come from local colleges and/or STEM-based companies. The August Marine Science Camp will focus on college level marine biology and will be conducted at two venues: Scripps Institute and USC Marine science Center at Catalina Island. Promotion of the program and student recruitment will start in September 2023. The application period will be from October to December and the program will start in January 2024. Our current approach provides instruction for high school students at a middle school level and students quickly lose interest, which affects retention. Elevating and expanding the classes will not only improve interest and retention, but is will improve preparation for college and interest in STEM careers."

    "summary": "LACP's Outreach Program offers after school photography workshops and experiences for youth ages 12 - 18 from historically underserved communities. The self-expression that comes with artistic learning promotes better health and well-being as youth have the opportunity to express their feelings as well as explore their likes, and dislikes constructively. Art inherently builds on youths' emotional development, helping them find their space within themselves as well as their community.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Teenage life has enough challenges on its own. With pandemic-induced isolation, distance learning, and social justice matters at the forefront, the past three years have hit youth hard, especially those in underserved communities, who are also impacted by the traumas of immigration and displacement. Finding a way to express themselves in the face of troubling news and their own traumatic experiences is essential for youth's well-being. LACP's Outreach Program provides the vehicle for youth to engage in a social-emotional creative experience in a safe space that empowers them to find their voice through artistic expression. Photography workshops offered by LACP seek to provide non-verbal forms of creative expression and communication, aspiring to empower participants by encouraging them to develop, articulate and share their own lived experience and perspective on their world.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "LACP's Outreach Program offers free photography workshops and experiences for youth ages 12 - 18 from historically underserved communities in collaboration with the Children's Institute, Arts at Blue Roof and is finalizing a partnership with Inglewood Parks and Recreation. Offerings include summer workshops and afterschool programs. Summer workshops are offered as a one-week class, Monday - Friday, 10 am - 1 pm, over a period of six weeks, for a total of six classes. They are held at an art center/photo gallery in Los Angeles. During summer workshops, youth explore photography that connects their vision as storytellers with their surrounding environment. Afterschool programs are offered for a total of fifteen hours, meeting twice a week for 1.5 hours per session, over five weeks. During the after-school workshops, youth learn basic photography fundamentals and learn concepts of portraiture by photographing fellow classmates. Previously held at Legacy Middle School and Locke High School in Los Angeles, LACP's Outreach Program is in the final stages of becoming a vendor with LAUSD and is poised to expand its programming across the district in the 2023-24 school year. Whether it be summer, school-based, or after school programming, each workshop/session culminates with an event that exhibits the students' work with their community and the wider world. These events are open and promoted to the general public.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Artistic outcomes of youth participants will be measured by demonstration of their grasp of essential camera functioning (e.g., ISO, shutter speed, aperture, white balance, and frame rate) and basic composition principles, including line, shape, texture, color, tone, distance, balance, and space. Developmental outcomes focus on cognitive, behavioral, and social determinants, such as: academic outcomes and behaviors (lower suspension rates, optimism about college or post-secondary career, increased school attachment and engagement, increased standardized test scores and GPAs, higher rates of graduating on time); practical skills that translate into real-life situations, such as: problem-solving, critical thinking, and affirmative decision-making; and social skills (communication, empathy, resilience, self-confidence). A primary outcome is that youth learn how to not just look, but see.",

It opens children's minds, allows them to form thoughts and ideas, and communicate their feelings in a positive way, promoting better overall health and well-being. LACP has designed a curriculum and employs a teaching methodology that creates a safe culturally affirming learning environment that promotes this building trusting relationships with youth through: -\tBuilding a culture of inclusion and respect that welcomes all participants. -\tGiving effective praise participants when they model thoughtfulness and respect for peers, adults, and the community. -\tSetting a tone of respect. -\tModeling appropriate behavior and genuine caring. As youth embody these experiences, they carry these qualities into the world around them. As such, LA benefits directly from this work through the independent, artistically-minded individual they continuously evolve into."

The program will create an IOS and android app that engages users in challenges specifically engineered to counteract unhealthy smart phone usage and facilitates access to the supports and capabilities proven to improve developmental outcomes (developmental assets). The target population for the application will be children between the ages of 11 and 13, on the cusp of adolescence and typically transitioning from elementary to middle school educational environments. Developmental assets, 40 measurable, observable, evidence based experiences and capabilities, will anchor the challenge content along with input from end users to help drive program design in a manner consistent with youth experiences and current fascination trends. It is a compelling program, designed for and by end users, that challenges young people to engage in developmental asset rich activities, is incentivized in s manner that is meaningful to the users, using a platform familiar to and notably engaged in by adolescent youth, that counteracts isolation, sleep deprivation and social media consumption practices currently supported by smart phone utilization practices.

The alarming increase in youth mental illness spans race, gender, and economic status, yet is contained to the age groups of adolescent youth and young adults. Notably, this upward trend aligns with smart phone market saturation and increasing dependence upon them. During adolescence, young people rely heavily on social interaction to learn, grow, and flourish. Smart phone proliferation over the past 15 years has drastically altered how society as a whole connects and communicates. Young people, traversing a stage of human development notably reliant on social connection, are disproportionately affected by this new social landscape. To accommodate, nationally representative studies indicate increased isolation, sleep deprivation, and excessive consumption of social media within this age demographic. All barriers to healthy development.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The Los Angeles County communities will learn about positive youth development and gain access to developmental asset opportunities. Furthermore, Los Angeles will unlock new and innovative access to asset acquisition and young people will develop the support and capabilities they need to navigate the vagaries of the teen years. Through the initial community engagement process, LA County will become more aware of and informed about developmental assets. Once launched, the app short term outcome will be increased acquisition of developmental assets, which will be monitored using the Developmental Assets Profile, a valid and reliable measure, that will be embedded in the app itself. Intermediate outcomes will be improved school attendance, reduced disciplinary incidents and improved academic performance. And, perhaps more importantly, LA County will see increased adolescent young people discovering their own unique awesome. The app platform will also facilitate future scalability.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Initial program success will be measured by engaging communities in a collaborative effort to design a product. Engagement will allow an opportunity for Intentional Mental Health to spread awareness about positive youth development, while gaining insight about what will connect with the program users themselves. IMH will host events with the goal of engaging 200 end users in focus group sessions and design testing. Once complete, IMH will test the program prototype, for which success will be defined as an increase in developmental assets by the users. To measure this, users will complete the Developmental Assets Profile (DAP)prior to program participation and once again after three months. A significant increase in assets indicated on the DAP will be considered success. The application platform allows for IMH to closely monitor future success and collect data regarding higher yielding features that promote continued development of the app itself and research worthy data.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "With the rising threat of climate change, the need to address outdoor inequity and increase access to green spaces in underserved neighborhoods is more important than ever. Nowhere is this more critical than in the Public Housing Projects in Watts. Here's why: Watt's Nickerson Gardens is the largest public housing project West of the Mississippi and home to some of LA's most vulnerable residents: family income is $1,792/mo. and 39% live below the poverty line. It has the most single-parent households (60%) and 95.3% of children get free school meals. All 4,500 residents are people of color: Hispanic (58.8%) or Black (39.7%) and the largest growing demographic is 10 yrs old and younger (31%). The Nickerson Gardens development was built in the 1940s with few green spaces; most trees were cut down during '65 Watts Riots for LAPD helicopter visibility and never replaced. The nearest park is a mile away, and federal housing rules do not permitted residents to plant their own gardens.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "GreenSpacesLA has CommUNITY Gardens in 2 of Watt's 3 public housing projects (Imperial Courts & Jordan Downs). Funding from LA2050, will enable us to create a garden in the 3rd housing project: Nickerson Gardens CommUNITY Garden. We plan to reimagine an existing, 10,000 sq.ft. abandoned, weed-infested garden plot in the center of the project. We don't plant to reconstruct the old space where residents were tasked with tending their own individual plots. Most community gardens like this, particularly in low income neighborhoods, quickly languish and are abandoned as residents find it too difficult or don't have the time required to maintain it, move away or lose interest. Instead, we will create a more modern type of community garden that we will maintain; one that will thrive and operate in the same way as our smaller but wildly successful Unity Garden in Imperial Courts. With resident input we will create a vibrant garden with 6 large community-access vegetable/herb boxes; 12 fruit tree \"forest\"; 200+ plant drought-tolerant meadow walk; & a children's discovery garden. It will be a new kind of outdoor hub for residents: a peaceful oasis for young and old. A garden where neighbors meet to gather vegetables, clip herbs for a recipe, pick wildflowers for a vase, or just stop and \"smell the roses.\" A garden where GSLA partners with community groups to host events, youth nature clubs and meets w/ local organizations to develop programs to get them in the garden regularly.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We've developed very successful Community Partnerships and Resident Engagement. We have a strong collaboration with Housing Authority of LA (HACLA) and long-term space-use agreements with them for our gardens. We have robust community outreach partnerships w/ ROC Era, Children Mending Hearts and RedEye/Watts Empowerment Center for our Youth Nature Clubs and Unity Days. LA Dept of Public Works, CA State Parks&Recreation, Supervisor Holly Mitchell, National Garden Conservancy, & Hancock Park Garden Club remain strong community funding partners. We are conducting a residential survey this summer to measure active participation in the gardens and the sense of community they promotes. Key indicators of success will be the # of residents who report participating in the garden outside of GSLA events and % who report an increased sense of community/connection with their neighbors. We plan to develop similar collaborations, partnerships and a survey for the Nickerson Garden CommUNITY garden."

They do not have proper guidance and support to help them navigate entrance into those fields. Many well qualified students do not consider STEAM careers because they often do not know or have never met anyone operating in those fields. This leads to a lack of motivation to challenge themselves to taking and excelling in STEAM courses in middle and high school. Additionally, we have observed that most inner-city, low-income and BIPOC students are not aware of the myriad of interests, careers and jobs that fall within the STEAM umbrella, and we believe it imperative that we educate them with that knowledge. We also understand the importance of exposing this demographic to these fields at an early age, therefore we will be working with middle students as well through this project.",

We conduct orientations and solicit input from all stakeholders (participants, program staff, school staff, family). We will determine student's beginning base of knowledge and experiences of college, career pathways and STEAM options at the beginning of the program via a pre-assessment and then evaluate the success of the program via a post program assessment. We will use quantitative data for evaluation, as well as qualitative data, as a reflection of participant expectation, experience, perceived and actual outcomes. As is a part of our mission, we work collaboratively with schools that we partner with to provide quality experiences for participants. Their input will be vital to the success of our program. A key factor to success of this program is linkages to community based resources, visiting higher education settings, careers and professionals in STEAM fields. We will provide parent education, have parent participation and train school staff to work with and support youth, especially first generation college youth as they investigate and explore post-secondary educational and career opportunities.

Many undocumented youth believe that college or their dream careers are not an option for them due to their legal status, as they think work permits and social security numbers are required or that they are ineligible to apply. As COVID-19 disproportionately impacted low-income mixed-status families, CA Dream Act and FAFSA financial aid applications among undocumented students declined by 16% and 3% from 2020 to 2021. Undocumented youth are also impacted by immigration policy changes and the legal battle over DACA, which had granted access to temporary protected status and work permits. With the growing number of youth who cannot access DACA and uncertainty about their futures, it is urgent to advocate for resources and ensure they are aware of the opportunities available to them regardless of status to achieve their dreams of achieving higher education.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We are addressing the impact of low health literacy on patients which is very well explained by the following excerpt from a 2016 National Library of Medicine published study titled \"Health Literacy and Access to Care\" by Helen Levy, PhD & Alex Janke BS: \"Individuals with low health literacy are significantly more likely than individuals with adequate health literacy to delay or forego needed care or to report difficulty finding a provider, even after controlling for other factors including health insurance coverage, employment, race/ethnicity, poverty, and general cognitive function. They were also more likely to lack a usual source of care, although this result was only marginally significant after controlling for other factors. The results show that in addition to any obstacles that low health literacy creates within the context of the clinical encounter, low health literacy also reduces the probability that people get in the door of the health care system in a timely way.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our vision for the success of the project is to have helped vulnerable and underserved individuals in San Gabriel Valley to gain access to healthcare with significantly improved patient outcomes and decreased medical errors. Additionally, we envision that our project will help to create a community of patient empowerment and safety with the leadership of local volunteers trained by HHP, who are knowledgable in being able to help their communities to understand the healthcare resources they are entitled to and where people are confident in accessing their healthcare system. Our vision for the future is for all individuals in Los Angeles to be able to receive the benefit of the program and for it to be funded for example, by Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and other city, county, state and federal agencies and for the program to be made available to individuals throughout the US and other countries."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In 2022, the CDC released a Youth Risk Behavior Survey identified Latinx and Indigenous youth to be amongst the highest rated to have experienced sexual violence. Sexual abuse is a primary predictor of girls' entry into the juvenile justice system. A 2015 study about girls in the juvenile justice system indicated that in California, nearly 81% of girls were sexually or physically abused. Sexual violence increases the likelihood of suicidal ideation, depression, substance use, and PTSD in survivors. Additionally, Indigenous and Latinx youth have the highest rates of mental health challenges, including suicidality. About half of mental health challenges begin by age 14. When untreated, mental health disorders likely worsen, persist into adulthood, and contribute to secondary challenges like substance use, contact with law enforcement, school dropouts, job loss, and even death. It is imperative that prevention and early intervention programs exist to mitigate high risk issues for youth.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "KLBRI's project consists of implementation of the Xinachtli Youth Rites of Passage curriculum weaved with the teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) training program. Xinachtli is a 16-week gender-responsive, culturally-based rites of passage philosophy, process, and curriculum that promotes healing, resilience, and leadership capacity of Xicana, Latinx and Indigenous girls and gender expansive youth. tMHFA teaches and trains teens in grades 10-12 (ages 15-18) how to identify, understand and respond to signs of a mental health or substance use challenge in their friends and peers. Both Xinachtli and tMHFA are most effective as prevention and early intervention programs. The earlier intervention, the better the outcome. KLBRI understands that the health of the circle is determined by the health of the facilitators as such KLBRI hopes to access funds from this project to build facilitator capacity to work with youth. One of our facilitator cohort participants shared \"Relationships, families, and communities grounded in radical love and reciprocity are possible through the existence of KLBRI X Xinachtli. This circulo (circle) cultivates a space of care that deepens the relationships of self, each other, and our connections. If more girls, women, and gender-expansive folx had the opportunity of walking with KLBRI X Xinachtli, more windows of healing and resilience could open for our communities to build and thrive.\" We are ready to answer that call.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles County would be transformed by our innovative and healing-centered program that weaves Xinachtli Rites of Passage Youth Leadership with the teen Mental Health First Aid curricula in multiple ways. Firstly, systems impacted femme-identified and gender expansive youth will have safe and sacred spaces and a cosmovision for healing and leadership development grounded in indigenous pathways of healing. Secondly, this would increase youth's sense of belonging, identity formation, and interconnectedness while catalyzing intergenerational organizing power. These outcomes reflect to both youth and communities the power of la cultura cura (culture heals) framework to disrupt the abuse to prison pipeline, reduce recidivism, and increase positive health outcomes for youth, their families, and communities. Lastly, participants would serve as peer mental health first aiders implementing prevention and stigma-reduction strategies for peers around substance use and community violence.",

The U.S. has the largest Korean diaspora community in the world, with California boasting the greatest density of Koreans. The U.S. also boasts the largest Lao community outside Asia, with the greatest percentage along the West Coast. Stories of the aging first generation Korean and Lao immigrants and refugees are commonly untold due to the trauma and loss that are intertwined with the challenges of political unrest, war, migration, and acculturation.

For our youth, this is literally a matter of life and death. According to a new CDC study, the U.S. is experiencing an extreme teen mental-health crisis with the highest levels of teen sadness and suicidality ever recorded. This catastrophic epidemic is intertwined with the failure of our standard approach to literacy, especially for students of color, and the pandemic's traumatic effect on students. Post-pandemic reading scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) indicate a decline of 30% for all students. These statistics translate into greater struggles in school, lower graduation rates, a higher likelihood of incarceration, and generally bleaker futures.

Our Surf Therapy Course will support new and established programs providing mentoring, development, and evaluation and supplying them with the most current measures of the benefits to surf therapy. We will use qualitative and quantitative research methods to gather data on the experiences of surf therapy practitioners. The data will drive the makings of the course and manual used to train new practitioners and expand the reach of surf therapy in the region. By increasing access to surf therapy, our project aims to promote mental health and well-being, play equity, and inclusion in outdoor activities. Objectives; Conduct a research study with hundreds of surf therapy practitioners. Obtain the perspective of practitioners for the first time. Benefit from the practitioner's perspective. Evaluate research to identify practices backed by positive mental health outcomes. Integrate research and practitioner perspectives Develop a Surf Therapy Manual. Create the Surf Therapy Training Course based on the manual. Adding additional (outside the study) but LA-based community resources to the manual.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our study will lead to an increased understanding of the benefits of surf therapy, an alternative and innovative form of mental healthcare, and it will help develop standardized surf therapy training courses. More people will have access to safe, general principles of practice and program development. As a result, surf therapy programs can be expanded and scaled up in LA County, providing more individuals with access. LA County is a location that is historically known for its surf culture. LA County could take the lead as a community committed to essential mental health interventions that simultaneously add to the coastal conversation and climate change. This would position LA's people, organizations, and municipal entities as leaders worldwide in supporting the critical work of surf therapy organizations to address the pressing mental health challenges globally. This can lead to improved mental health outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and a healthier and happier community.",

This is why we work zealously to pursue release from detention for every client possible. However, leaving detention is often just the beginning: formerly incarcerated immigrants must continue to pursue their immigration cases to final decision while also ensuring they have income, healthcare, housing, food, and other essentials to thrive while in these emotionally difficult legal proceedings. Given Los Angeles county's proximity to the United States-Mexico border and numerous immigration detention centers, it is a place where many immigrants go to begin their lives in the United States after bravely crossing the border or leaving immigration detention.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "AOL represents immigrants in legal cases that are on what is called a \"non-detained docket.\" In immigration removal proceedings, or proceedings commenced against immigrants by the United States with the goal of deportation, cases are heard either on a detained docket or a non-detained dockets. The detained docket moves much more quickly than the non-detained docket because immigrants on the detained docket are incarcerated and their liberty interest is at stake. However, immigrants who leave detention face massive obstacles to a smooth transition in their legal proceedings. They must change court venue from the detained docket court where they were incarcerated to a non-detained docket; ensure they have legal representation in the new venue; present their case again to a new judge unfamiliar with their story; ensure they either continue to have legal counsel in the new venue or find new representation in their new geographic location. Exacerbating these difficulties is the fact that the non-detained docket is massively backlogged, with many cases on timelines of two, three, four, or even five years until final decision. AOL works with formerly incarcerated immigrants to ensure their cases are successfully transferred to the non-detained docket, provide direct representation before the new court, and connect them with resources to live while their cases slowly proceed.

Research studies indicate the direct link between educational attainment, economic opportunity, and wealth building. \"Education reduces poverty, boosts economic growth and increases income. Lack of access to education is one of the most certain ways of transmitting poverty from generation to generation\" (\"The Benefits of Education\", Global Partnership for Education website). In California, obtaining a high-school diploma reduces the chance of incarceration by 87% (Life course Framework, Forward Change Consulting, 2018). Higher Pathways complements the 18-25 year old population of opportunity youth and consists of 3 parallel tracks - (1) College Pathway to Success (2) Career Readiness and (3) Supportive Services. College Pathway to Success is an educational attainment track that begins with the Urban Scholars program for high school students and continues with college access and persistence. The Career Readiness track comprises workforce skill development, internship/externships/part-time employment, and entrepreneurial exploration. Lastly, Supportive Services provides wrap-around counseling sessions to ensure positive, healthy engagement with their experience, as well as access to additional resources as needed for unforeseen incidents or emergencies.",

In 2017, it was estimated that there are 73,000 Opportunity Youth in Los Angeles, which represent 13.7 percent of the total Los Angeles youth between ages 16 and 24. Black youth account for the second largest share of opportunity youth, or about 14 percent, or 10,000 in total.

As a result, student mental health and social-emotional skills have been negatively impacted. This is compounded by high rates of stress, burnout, and attrition among afterschool program staff and classroom teachers (EdSource). Staff have observed that students who took a break from in-person learning due to COVID-19 are less able to manage their behavior, less engaged, more reactive, and inexperienced at socializing in school settings. Staff and students at partnering LAUSD schools have thus expressed increased need for TFP programs at this time. \"The middle school and high school years can make students feel like all of their value is external. This curriculum helps them go inside and discover their inherent worth.\" - Melissa Ruiz, TFP Program Director",

Our diverse team of TFP Facilitators are all LAUSD alumni, most of whom work in the same schools they themselves attended. TFP Facilitators are trained and experienced in delivering our evidence-based social-emotional learning curriculum, which includes mindfulness activities (yoga, meditation, and art), personal reflection, group discussion, and community service. The TFP curriculum follows a three-step process: 1) Becoming Aware - Deeping awareness of thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations; 2) Broadening Perspective - Learning to proactively manage actions and reactions; 3) Compassion-in-Action - Engaging in service learning projects that address a community need. This grant will support TFP afterschool clubs (2-5 days per week) at Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School, Joseph Le Conte Middle School, Washington Irving Middle School, Thomas Starr King Middle School; monthly in-school workshops at Dr. Sammy Lee Medical and Health Science Magnet Elementary School; weekly virtual clubs offered year-round; and twice annual parent/caregiver workshops. It will allow us to deepen our impact by improving program frequency, accessibility, and quality.",

Empowered by increased self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-motivation, they will become compassionate leaders, promoting the core values of inclusion, non-judgement, and kindness in their relationships with family, friends, and the broader community. \"[TFP] has taught me to take a step back and prioritize what I give my attention to. I want to spend my time giving my best to the people I love.\" - TFP Participant Our long-term vision for TFP School-Based Programs includes enhanced capacity to deliver this transformative curriculum to all young people in Los Angeles who may benefit. We envision a robust, well-resourced facilitation team rooted deeply in their communities and the TFP curriculum. This grant will provide us with critical momentum towards achieving this vision.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Research demonstrates that kindness and compassion lead to increased wellbeing, a strengthened immune system, and positive relationships, and that mindfulness instruction improves psychological functioning. Research on youth-serving programs shows that mindfulness leads to lower rates of: depression, negative affect, negative coping, rumination, self-hostility, and post-traumatic symptom severity (Sibinga et al. PEDIATRICS, 2016). TFP measures its impact through participant surveys and interviews with staff, teachers, and parents. We have partnered with researchers at U.C. Riverside Emotion Regulation Lab to study The Effects of Mindfulness Meditation on Adolescents' Stress Management in TFP programs. Through these means we have demonstrated that TFP programs result in improved focus, conflict resolution skills, confidence, and reduced stress among participants. \"Mindfulness allowed [student name] to find a source of calm and a way to let go of negative thoughts.\" - TFP Parent"

LA County is home to one of the largest concentrations of non-English, non-Spanish speaking Central American immigrants in the country, but the US Census does not track them. Experts say that estimating population numbers is difficult because immigrants may be reluctant to reveal they speak an Indigenous language - fearing discrimination - or may not think it relevant.

At certain thresholds, the state is required to provide interpreters for health care. It's probable that some languages have met those levels. Use stories of poor interpretation and mishaps from the interpretation group to emphasize the need for this service.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If successful, at least 10-12 Indigenous language-speakers will be trained and will obtain paid work. The ability to work, to form their own collective of paid workers and exhibit leadership in this way will be tremendous. Their earning power will be a boost to their families and a model for their children. Interpretation is a valuable career and in great need! Indigenous language-speakers will be encouraged to come out of the shadows and be counted, for purposes of their language and civil rights. We also believe we can create stronger partnerships with the various indigenous immigrant groups for the purpose of improving the rights of non-English, non-Spanish speakers, particularly the right to interpretation if a language is spoken by certain numerical levels in one zip code or two contiguous zip codes. The state updates language needs infrequently. If successful, we expect to see fewer medical mishaps, medication errors and other problems that happen due to misunderstanding.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "This project will provide the staff (two experienced advocates, immigrants themselves) and funds for emergency grants to help 500 immigrant and refugee women connect to vital services especially financial, legal, and medical for their pregnancy and beyond. Our advocates who have more than 10 years' experience each, help pregnant women on a daily basis connect with services like WIC, MediCal, and other non-profits like Carecen and CHIRLA who also do strong work to help immigrant and refugee families with essential services like legal help. One of the groups that often need guidance are TPS recipients. Our staff is familiar with the procedures related to TPS and successfully refer women to the appropriate groups and resources regularly. One of our staff is a \"TPSer.\" When they arrive at our offices or call us, we are able to guide them to reputable resources because sadly, many immigrants are swindled by fraudsters who take their money and do not resolve their issues. When they arrive with us, we open up a solid and complete horizon of support. A significant number of clients are also victims of abuse like domestic violence. We are able to encourage them to seek legal help and have accompanied some to the police department, as some have requested. We provide much-needed items like diapers and clothing as well as small grant for rent and bills. Diapers alone can cost a family up to $100 a month. We help provide diapers for a year and beyond if needed.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Immigrants and refugees arrive every day into the Los Angeles area, many pregnant, and do not know where to turn for important services like medical, legal or financial. Most are afraid to approach government or community offices due to their immigration status. Providing guidance, material assistance, and emotional support from an organization staffed by immigrants is extremely helpful. Knowledgeable and dedicated personnel who have personally navigated the system and are familiar with other non-profits who offer vital services to immigrants in a sensitive and confidential manner has made a big difference for immigrants and refugees in their capacity to thrive. We serve families primarily in person but also help women and families who contact us via phone and email.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our project will make a difference in the lives of at least 500 newly arrived immigrant and refugee families in their ability to connect to critical services they might be afraid to seek out or whose existence has not been brought to their attention. We currently serve approximately 300 new clients a year in person and via phone/email. We would like to increase our visibility with other community partners so that they know that the immigrants and refugees they serve can find additional support with us, especially those who are mothers and facing a challenging pregnancy situation. Funding this project will make Los Angeles a more welcoming city for the many women who arrive here and are seeking pregnancy support which they deserve to receive."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Baby2Baby distributes diapers and other basic necessities, such as hygiene items, clothing, and wipes, to homeless shelters and low-income housing organizations across LA County. This support ensures low-income children receive essential items, and it allows parents to prioritize other expenses, such as rent and utilities, helping to combat homelessness and housing insecurity. Baby2Baby is uniquely qualified to conduct this work. Since its founding in 2011, Baby2Baby has served more than one million children and has provided over 150 essentials in the Greater Los Angeles area. Baby2Baby serves children living in low-income households, which Baby2Baby defines as those with incomes of no more than 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. Baby2Baby works with over 500 orgs across LA from underserved school districts, hospitals, clinics, resource centers, and more. This grant will support Baby2Baby's distribution of over 500,000 diapers annually to 56 shelters and low-income housing orgs across LA County. Baby2Baby has three warehouses in LA to store its inventory of diapers and other essentials. Baby2Baby provides the partner orgs with a standard needs assessment, which gauges the number of children being served by the org, its most needed items, and its storage capacity. Each week, the warehouse team organizes the diapers and other essentials based on the need assessments and ships them to the partner organizations where they are distributed to children and families.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Each year since 2011, Baby2Baby has increased the number of diapers it distributes and expands its partnerships. In 2022, Baby2Baby distributed over 19 million essentials through over 500 partnerships in LA County; nearly 1.5 million of these essentials went directly to homeless shelters and low-income housing. Feedback from constituents demonstrates the life-changing impact of this program. Shelly Palmdale of LA shared, \"When Covid hit, my husband and I lost our jobs. Sometimes we would eat just rice and beans, or just rice. We didn't have money to buy diapers. We decided to get all the change that we had in our house to get the cheapest diapers for my daughter. It was heartbreaking. It hurts because you want to do everything you can just to protect them, but when you can't and you have no other option, you're hopeless. But Baby2Baby, they're there to help you when you're at your lowest point. I've never had somebody that cared about us that much, so Baby2Baby for me is a blessing.\"",

This support will provide families financial relief that will allow them to focus their financial resources on obtaining other basic necessities, paying rent, and enhancing their quality of life. By providing access to free diapers, Los Angeles families living in poverty will not have to choose between providing their child with clean diapers or paying rent.??During this grant period, Baby2Baby will increase its diaper distribution from 535,883 last year to 625,000 and expand its partnerships to reach more low-income families. In the long-term, this program will address the roots of poverty and help decrease homelessness in LA County. A study by the Diaper Bank of Connecticut demonstrated that when families receive supplies of clean diapers, they are more likely to pursue their education and secure and maintain jobs.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 12,500",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reports that about one in 150 Angelenos, or 69,000 people, experience homelessness. The cost of diapers and other childcare essentials greatly contributes to low-income families' financial insecurities and puts them at risk of homelessness. The cost of raising a child is notoriously expensive, costing an average of $17,000 a year, according to a 2022 Brookings Institution analysis. Diapers are the fourth highest household expense for low-income families with children, behind rent, food, and utilities. Disposable diapers can cost families an average of $100 a month per baby, an expense that is not subsidized by the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).?A lack of diapers can prevent parents from obtaining childcare and cause them to miss work or struggle to find work all together.?Childcare support is essential to preventing low-income families from experiencing homelessness."

Individuals living with a serious mental illness only receive approximately $44 a day from the State to meet their housing and care needs -- just not enough! Without immediate State legislative action, thousands of elderly and people living with SMI will remain at risk of becoming homeless as ARF's and RCFE's continue to struggle and close. This gross and inequitable funding system creates unequal access to care and housing and maintains financial systems that harm low-income people living with SMI, predominantly people of color who lack access to resources with limited knowledge about navigating the system.",

We serve our members and the community, championing resources for facilities and residents; building increased public awareness and support through a grassroots network supporting housing and health solutions that serve vulnerable, disadvantaged adults, and the elderly, living with SMI on public benefits. This project brings together board and care owners/operators, community based non-profits, faith-based organizations, health and homeless advocates, local businesses and community leaders to increase the public awareness of ARF's and RCFE's, and develop best practices across the industry, championing resources for disadvantaged residents living with SMI. This proposal provides innovative solutions to bring permanent affordability and community control to help ease LA County's housing crisis for SMI people whose income is 200% of the federal poverty level. It gives a voice to ARF's and RCFE's to develop recommendations and policy solutions that are human centered, bringing forward industry best practices to meet the needs of their residents. LARCA provides educational and training opportunities, develops relationships with those serving the health needs of ARF and RCFE clients, tracks and disseminates information, and advocates for our case before public officials.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Success may bring new avenues to supportive housing and mental health services. Currently, homeless individuals receiving mental health care are more likely to continue to be homeless upon discharge, or may not be able to continue mental health services due to not having stable housing. Having a safe and secure place to live is a vital part of wellness and recovery. Success in the short term will include the development of financing models that will sustain the operation of LARCA; and increase our support network by cultivating and establishing relationships with public officials and agencies serving the health needs of ARF's and RCFE's. Long Term success will include an effect on ARF and RCFE closures; develop a community land trust that allows for equitable participation by residents with lived experience, mental health consumers, and family members of residents living with SMI; and a sustainable financial model for existing and new ARF's and RCFE's."

Research published by USC's Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative, headed by Dr. Stacy L. Smith, establishes that of the 1,000 top grossing films released from 2007 to 2016, only 5.1% of the directors were Black-27 Black directors out of a group of 1,114. Smith also concludes that Black women directors \"have been nearly invisible in the director's chair.\" These data indicate that no meaningful change has occurred regarding Black representation behind the camera. A few strides have been made, particularly with the multiple award-winning projects of Ryan Coogler, Barry Jenkins, and Ava DuVernay, but developing strong talent pipelines is crucial. Uniquely preparing Black industry leaders with globally focused curriculum in our transnational media environment builds representation behind and in front of the camera."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Through direct outreach, classes, word of mouth, videos and use of social media in several indigenous languages and Spanish, we will inform immigrants of the upcoming health coverage opportunity, and refer them to our enrollment staff. We have used radio shows and FB Live programs with success for Census work and during the pandemic. On 1-1-24, these enrollments will become \"full scope\" Medi-Cal providing vision, dental, in-home support and other services. It is essential to utilize immigrants to reach out to immigrants because of fear, misinformation and bureaucracy. MCHA has extensive connections already with Central American clientele, and will use direct contact - phone calls and texting, our events, door-to-door and and community opportunities, such as marketplaces and social services sites - to address three major issues: Lack of awareness. Although full health coverage expanded to young adults 18-26 in 2020, and to adults 50 and over in 2022, we still see eligible immigrants not enrolled. Fear. Under the prior administration, prohibition against immigrant use of government benefits expanded. The fear that using government benefits would impact one's immigration status was and is a barrier, although prohibitions have been lifted. Bureaucracy. Unfortunately, completing an enrollment successfully can be difficult, even more so since enrollment and maintenance of one's benefits is largely online. This is a huge hurdle for those with an often unwritten language.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If successful, a large majority of the eligible population will be enrolled in health coverage as of 1-1-24 or shortly thereafter and will have the opportunity to address longstanding chronic conditions, get glasses and dental care, and help to stay in their home if infirm, among other benefits. Being healthy affects the ability to work and support oneself and one's family, family relationships and mental health. Health care is complex and overwhelming for those born in this country with a command of the English language. It is more so for someone who has no one to assist them in their own language. Longer term, we hope to help enumerate and bring focus to the issues these groups face. If successful, interpretation in non-English, non-Spanish languages will be recognized as a right, fewer immigrants will be uninsured, and more immigrants will be healthy, with their post emergency, chronic and other care needs addressed.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "California will seek to enroll more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants in health coverage, over 200,000 of whom are in Los Angeles County, in advance of the coverage start date of 1-1-24. However, many are \"hard to reach\" due to language and other barriers. Los Angeles County is home to one of the largest concentrations of non-English, non-Spanish speaking Central American immigrants in the country, but the US Census does not track them. MCHA has worked with immigrants since our founding in 1996. Our outreach staff speak Mayan languages, as the languages of Guatemala are called, and know their communities. Immigrants have attended our weekly classes and other events, and been assisted with housing, health and food issues since our founding. But fear, bureaucracy, illiteracy, language barriers, and confusion or lack of knowledge about the need to sign up and choose a health plan, for example, will keep many from receiving this essential support."

In California, an estimated 33% of 7th and 9th graders and 50% of 11th graders experienced chronic sadness in the 2020-2021 school year and an estimated 1 in 10 youth between the ages of 12 and 17 suffered from at least one major depressive episode in the last year. Nurturing students' social-emotional skills is crucial to addressing these historic well-being needs. At the same time, across academic progress indicators, students of color, low-income students, English Learners, foster youth, students with disabilities, and homeless students have been set back further than their more advantaged peers since the pandemic. These students also often have less access to STEM learning experiences especially as schools deemphasized STEM in recent years. In particular, only 38% of Local Control and Accountability Plans for schools in California prioritize STEM learning.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Social-emotional skill development is vital to addressing student mental health. Hands-on STEM learning experiences, while addressing a number of academic priorities, provide inherent SEL skill practice, such as teamwork, conflict resolution, and mindfulness, that often is unnoticed to both students and STEM facilitators. STEM also is appealing to students, yet may students of color, low-income youth, and English language learners have limited access to STEM experiences. The proposed pilot program will bring STEM learning to students while also intentionally strengthening the SEL embedded in STEM activities. Further, the program will professionally develop STEM learning facilitators by evaluating their practice and building their awareness of the connections between SEL and STEM. The pilot will see EduCare Foundation staff deliver their proven ACE Program, which directly focuses on SEL, as a backbone. EduCare's ACE Program provides deep SEL activities to high school students throughout a semester. A select group of LA STEM Collective members, including museums and aquariums, will then provide hands-on STEM learning activities, covering topics from aerospace to oceans. These STEM activities also will highlight SEL practices being emphasized in ACE. A formal evaluation will explore that connection and its effect on student outcomes. The pilot program proposes to work with 8 EduCare ACE Initiative schools over the course of 9 weeks in the Spring 2024 semester.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "A recent survey saw students in LA County listing mental health as their number one concern. The pilot program seeks to address this need by providing social-emotional learning to students both directly and through STEM activities, giving educators more tools to address this concern of students. STEM activities motivate and appeal to students of all backgrounds. Strengthening the SEL aspects of STEM learning can help fill the gap in programs that address nurturing students' social and emotional development. The pilot program will explore the connection between SEL and STEM while building the skills of program facilitators in both categories and providing rich learning experiences for students. The goal is to build upon the lessons learned from the pilot to then develop a large-scale program initiative that intentionally combines STEM and SEL for students, especially students of color, low-income students and English language learners, across LA County.",

Many of our families are from BIPOC communities, and/or are recent immigrants who are English language learners learning to navigate new systems. We partner with the LAUSD and other local school districts to alleviate one of the most visible signs of poverty so students can go to school ready to learn. In response to community need, we recently developed a partnership with the LA County Office of Education, which serves housing insecure and foster youth.

Shoes have a direct impact on a child's school attendance, behavior and attitude, and level of activity on the playground and with classmates. Teachers regularly report that they have no other resources for shoes, and we have a waiting list of schools who need help. We collect quantitative analysis and qualitative data provided by teachers, administrators, kids, and parents, as well as through community guidance solicited through annual surveys of school administrators and teachers who share the changes in behavior they observe in their students. Results from our biannual surveys in 2022 are a testament to the success of our programs: 90% of respondents reported an improvement in confidence among the children who received new shoes; 87% noted an increase in self-esteem; 85% reported an improved attitude; 76% noted an increase in physical activity; and 47% reported a rise in attendance.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "STF will improve the quality of 40,000 kids' lives in LA County next year, helping to remove a basic barrier to success. Chronic absenteeism occurs at rates 3 to 4 times higher in high-poverty areas, according to a study conducted by Johns Hopkins University. Students who are chronically absent are at serious risk of falling behind in school. Compared to their white peers, American Indian and Pacific Islander students are over 50 percent more likely to lose three weeks of school or more, Black students 40 percent more likely, and Hispanic students 17 percent more likely. Without proper footwear, kids are more likely to miss school and be unable to particulate fully in activities (2.ed.gov). We know from research and community feedback that shoes are a critical and often overlooked need when addressing child poverty. Longer term, these funds will ensure that we continue to build out our infrastructure and ability to scale our operations to meet increased need in the future.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Last year, STF served 33,469 children in LA County, but the demand for services is much greater. We have the logistics expertise and partnerships with the shoe industry to bring these resources to more than 40,000 children this coming year to try to meet the growing demand. A grant from LA2050 would provide shoes for 2500 of these children. STF staff identify schools with high concentrations of low-income students, and school administrators and teachers identify the kids most in need. We provide teachers and administrators with tools and training to measure children's feet and ensure that 100% of children served receive new shoes that fit. All programs deliver new, name-brand athletic shoes to children in need at a cost of $30 per pair. As an example, STF recently partnered with the LA Rams to provide 400 pairs of shoes to kids in Inglewood. Players like Keir Thomas and TJ Carter and the Rams mascot visited Highland Elementary, just a few miles from where they play. The kids got to test their brand new shoes out by doing fun drills with the athletes. When children grow up with the challenges of poverty, new shoes often aren't a priority in the family budget. But shoes that don't fit properly can hold children back from playing to their full potential. Principal Trevino Jones shared, \"It's an opportunity that most of us take for granted, however, it's very needed and our kids are very excited about it.\"",

The 5-month curriculum teaches apprentices healthcare systems such as electronic health records, and elements of case management, crisis de-escalation, trauma-informed care, and much more. The program provides firsthand job experience at HealthRIGHT 360 behavioral health programs and one-on-one mentors who offer guidance and support to the trainees. After completion of the program, apprentices will be assisted in job placement and securing certification as non-licensed alcohol/drug counselors. They will be eligible for permanent positions at HealthRIGHT 360 behavioral health outpatient and residential treatment programs located throughout Los Angeles County and elsewhere in the community. At the end of the grant period, twenty new healthcare workers will be job ready, and many placed in permanent positions.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) predicts \"serious workforce shortages\" in mental health and substance use disorder treatment in the next decade. LA County already faces an acute shortage of mental health workers, which has led to serious understaffing at clinics and other facilities at a time of rising demand. Filling these vacant spots has proven to be a major challenge. Our program addresses LA County's urgent need for an accessible, trained behavioral health workforce. Not only will the Training and Apprenticeship Program build a talent pipeline, expand community relationships and partnerships, and provide opportunities to those new in the field, but in addition, the program structure allows for growth and learning opportunities for existing mental health staff through mentoring, teaching, and assisting program participants, providing much needed leadership opportunities and improving retention.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Pilot or new project, program, or initiative",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "A study by UCSF in 2018 predicted that the need for mental health therapists would exceed supply by almost 40% by 2028. This trend accelerated and worsened during the pandemic. The lack of access to care is felt most acutely by those who receive services through community mental health providers, including the homeless, severely mentally ill, those with co-occurring disorders, and lower income people of color. The Governor has made transforming the mental health system in California a priority. HealthRIGHT 360 is already developing innovative approaches like our Training and Apprenticeship Program to meet critical mental health and substance use disorder needs now and in the future. If nothing is done to fill the void by 2028, many people diagnosed with behavioral health conditions will struggle to get the treatment they need. To those of us who work on the front lines of healthcare access, the shortages are already here and the time to act is now."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Affordable housing and homelessness is a complex issue that affects communities worldwide. Emaus House number 3 aims to address this problem by offering low barrier to entry housing for the most vulnerable individuals in society. Recognizing that individuals experiencing homelessness may require additional support, we go beyond housing provisions. The initiative offers a rent grant program for clients who require a temporary financial cushion to regain stability. This assistance, typically lasting for a period of 3 to 6 months, helps individuals rebuild their lives and work towards self-sufficiency. The ultimate goal of Emaus House 3 is to contribute to the reduction of homelessness and alleviate the burden faced by vulnerable individuals in society. By providing affordable housing options and comprehensive support services, the initiative strives to empower individuals, promote stability, and facilitate their reintegration into the community.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The impact of the Emaus House 1 and 2 program has been measured through various methods: -Housing stability is tracked by monitoring residents' length of stay and successful transitions to permanent housing. -Recidivism rates, measuring the number of individuals returning to homelessness, indicate the program's effectiveness in preventing recurring homelessness. -Client satisfaction surveys provide valuable feedback on the program's effectiveness and areas for improvement. -Data analysis of program outcomes, such as the number of individuals served, housing placements, employment rates, and exit destinations, provides measurable evidence of impact. -Case studies and success stories showcase individual transformations and highlight the program's positive outcomes. These evaluation methods collectively provide evidence that the Emaus Houses are successfully addressing homelessness and affordable housing in Los Angeles County.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The grant would support the leasing of our third Emaus House. We have found that Emaus House 1 & 2 need an an annual average subsidy between $13,000-20,000. We would love to fund this house for at least the next 4 years. This allows us to lease a house, expand capacity, and provide the continued care that our clients need. In addition to housing, we can continue to offer clothing, food, toiletries, and resume building assistance to clients in need. The program's main focus is on the most vulnerable individuals without stable housing. By offering affordable and accessible accommodations, Peregrinos De Emaus can expand capacity and ensures that those facing financial constraints can find safe and secure housing. The program's low-barrier-to-entry approach creates a supportive environment where individuals can focus on rebuilding their lives. By removing financial barriers, Emaus House 3 helps residents stabilize their situations and work towards independence. The grant's assistance is crucial in sustaining and expanding to our 3rd house. By supporting this initiative, the grant contributes to providing stable housing, essential amenities, and support services to vulnerable individuals. Emaus House 3 follows a holistic approach, empowering residents and promoting their independence and overall well-being.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The program would lead to a reduction in homelessness. By providing low-barrier housing, Emaus House 3 would help individuals transition out of homelessness and into stable living situations. Secondly, the program's success would contribute to improved stability and security for vulnerable individuals. Thirdly, Emaus House 3's affordable housing rates, would make housing more accessible to individuals with limited financial resources. By addressing the affordability gap, the program would prevent housing insecurity and provide a pathway to long-term stability. In summary, the success of the Emaus House 3 program in Los Angeles County would lead to a significant transformation. It would result in reduced homelessness, improved stability and security, increased affordability and accessibility, and a more efficient use of public resources. These positive changes would create a more inclusive, resilient, and thriving community for all residents."

AOL was founded in 2015 and has provided pro-bono legal services to indigent immigrants and refugees since then. AOL's staff have years of experience screening immigrant youth for legal representation in SIJ and Asylum proceedings. AOL currently represents 15 unaccompanied minors in SIJ cases and even more in Asylum proceedings. Our program's success rate reflects our expertise and the high quality of our work. AOL staff are not only experts on the legal complexities of navigating immigration matters for immigrant youth, but also have decades of combined experience connecting them with non-legal resources to ensure holistic, humane case management.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "AOL currently represents immigrant youth in their legal proceedings through a grant from the California Department of Social Services. Minors who have survived abuse, abandonment, or neglect at the hands of one or both of their parents in their countries of origin may come to the United States to seek permanency here under the Special Immigration Juvenile, or SIJ, status. Immigrant youth who have personally survived persecution or have been impacted by the persecution of family members may seek Asylum in the United States. AOL wants to expand this critically needed representation for immigrant youth. Our current capacity allows us to reach a much smaller population than we would like to represent, and the need for SIJ and immigrant youth Asylum representation in Los Angeles is great. Accordingly, this grant funding would allow us to more than double our current legal representation capacity for immigration youth in SIJ and Asylum proceedings.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Immigrant youth face some of the most significant obstacles to obtaining legal status in the United States: for one, they are expected to pursue their immigration cases without the benefit of appointed representation. That's right--indigent immigrant youth are not appointed counsel. We have seen toddlers appearing before immigration courts alone, expected to present their complex immigration case before a hostile court. Additionally, many immigrant youth are not fluent in English and lack robust support. Given Los Angeles county's proximity to the United States-Mexico border and numerous immigration detention centers, it is a place where many immigrant youth and their families go to begin their lives in the United States after bravely crossing the border fleeing abandonment, abuse, neglect, and/or persecution. Expanding our legal representation program will ensure that Los Angeles county is a more humane, dignified place for particularly vulnerable immigrant youth to live safely.",

Quantitative measures employed are tracking the completion of intakes, case filings, case outcomes, social services support, and case management progress points as defined by internal metrics. AOL tracks demographic data, application type, and other metrics as required. Qualitatively, we consider legal services a formalized form of storytelling, and we build our collective knowledge through sharing our observations, the experiences we hear from clients and their families and communities, and other narratives that inform our process and outcomes. Evidence that our efforts are working are the case outcomes that directly impact immigrant youth's legal paths to permanently stay in the United States. Since we began representing immigrant youth we have won numerous SIJ orders and obtained several grants of Asylum.

Empirical research indicates that education in the arts can enhance youth creativity, critical thinking, innovation, collaboration, and interpersonal communication skills, improving overall academic performance and decreasing dropout rates. Providing these K-12 STEAM educational workshops, with eventual long-term funding, will improve youth short-term education outcomes, also increasing youth skills and confidence to explore STEAM-based careers. LA County is home to 37,759 arts-related businesses that employ 265,874 people, accounting for 7% of total businesses and 5% of employed individuals. MOLAA seeks to bring the county closer to true proportional representation of Latinx professionals in this creative economy."

As they grow frailer and require more care, there will simply not be enough nursing homes to accommodate this demographic shift. And seniors do not want to go into a facility. According to an AARP survey, 82% of seniors wish to remain living independently in their homes. However, without ongoing care, living at home for frail seniors can lead to isolation and neglect, as well as stress and burnout for family caregivers. A market analysis conducted in June 2020 found that West Los Angeles encompasses 9,247 individuals who would qualify for a skilled nursing facility under Medicare due to their advanced age, level of disability and low income. The vast majority of these residents do not have access to a program that will enable them to age at home.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "BCSC is a federal- and state-designated \"Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly\" (PACE). Prior to opening BCSC in Reseda in 2013, there was only one other PACE center in Los Angeles and none serving the San Fernando Valley. Our flagship site has grown to serve more than 330 seniors and consistently exceeds statewide averages for participant outcomes and high satisfaction rates. The National Association of Social Workers' California chapter selected BCSC as its 2021 Organization of the Year. If we are successful, we will prove the replicability of BCSC, offering the same level of excellence at the West LA site and setting the stage for future expansion - which we intend. New sites become financially self-sustaining by Year 3 (>140 participants). At maximum enrollment, 400+ seniors are able to age at home with a level of care that has been proven to enhance and extend their lives. Their families are relieved of major caregiving responsibilities and freed for other pursuits.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Numerous research studies have demonstrated that, compared to comparably frail seniors, the PACE model results in: -\tSignificantly lower risk of dying than in other home-based programs. -\tReduction in hospitalization rates by 24% and rehospitalization rates by 16%. -\tLess than 1 emergency room visit per year on average. -\tCost savings of up to 42% compared to institutional care. Despite caring for a population whose health conditions and frailty make them eligible to be in nursing homes, the COVID case rate for PACE participants in California was 1/4 that of nursing home residents. BCSC closely tracks and reports quarterly on key performance indicators, such as hospitalizations, ER visits, falls, etc. We also have an annual satisfaction survey conducted by an independent evaluation consultant, which includes a 64-question survey and scripted in-person interviews that analyzes results across 11 domains of quality.

Our vision for this program is the development of a safety net that catches those families who are unable to pay their rent on their own and prevents them from falling into homelessness. Research shows that homelessness is expensive for social services and traumatic for families who experience it, and even modest financial assistance is oftentimes sufficient to help households maintain housing through a difficult season of their lives. Prevention programs continue to grow across the country, our hope is that with increased funding we will be able to provide sufficient support for all families in the Pasadena area who are most at-risk of falling into homelessness.",

Wages remain stagnant while rents continue to skyrocket (avg 1 BR $2200). Pasadena's poverty rate is 13.2 %. 58% of residents are renters and about half of those are rent burdened, paying more than 30% of their income on rent. 25% more are severely rent burdened, paying more than 50% of their income on rent. Numerous surveys report that 41-68% of Americans cannot cover a $1000 emergency. Without the resources to manage a financial setback, families risk falling deeper into arrears and facing the threat of eviction and homelessness. Once homeless, a family's entire structure is destabilized. Food, water, shelter and clothing are not guaranteed, children may miss school, and mental and physical health issues rise.

Because all clients are entered into the Homeless Management Information System, we are able to track not only whether they return to us, but whether they return to any agency in the area for assistance. In the past five years, less than 5% of clients have returned for additional rent support. Additionally, staff conduct follow-up surveys with all assistance recipients within several months of program exit, tracking their progress in continuing to stabilize their finances and stay current with rent.",

To achieve this, the participation and commitment of our students are necessary. But rapid-changing developments in renewable energy pose a challenge for educators to create a curriculum that is both up-to-date and engaging. Educational content needs to be hands-on, creative, innovative, and memorable so that students are excited about the opportunity to contribute to the progress of renewable energy. Renewable energy education needs to elevate our students from all backgrounds and bring them into the conversation, equip them with knowledge, provide a space to listen to all ideas, and develop them into advocates committed to renewable energy - ensuring a 100% renewable Los Angeles and an inhabitable planet in the decades to come.",

Prior to the grant period, the COBOR rights will be selected with input from county stakeholders through public surveys and focus groups. The 2050 grant will support the activation and implementation of the COBOR in L.A. County by funding the work of a Community Outreach Coordinator who will manage the initiative, working to connect the \"rights\" of the COBOR to resources for children and families. The Community Outreach Coordinator will engage in stakeholder relationship building, community organizing, and advocacy.

This would include the \"14 children\" referenced above who are outside of the foster system. The group is currently composed primarily of 20 grandmothers who care for approximately 40 grandchildren. The grandmothers live on fixed incomes, and they are not compensated at the same rate as a foster parent. They do not generally have the support of a social worker and often are navigating the system on their own. There is a tremendous amount of frustration within the group along with distrust of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). Our monthly meetings feature guest speakers to help educate them on what is available. Through these meetings, we have built trust and that is what is unique about our solution. Our Kinship Academy does not replicate other services already available through groups like Alliance for Children's Rights and DCFS but rather we listen to client frustrations and work to eliminate stumbling blocks. Additionally, we provide tangible resources as funds permit for special items. Technology education is a big area of need. Our clients have phones but they don't know all the uses of the phone and the computer is alien and intimidating. We have a few desktops, but with part of this grant we would add laptops to use for training purposes. Building trust is the best way to help these Kinship Caregivers navigate a complex community.",

In 2021, an estimated 1.15 million California children under the age of 18 lived in homes where a relative was head of household, and for every 1 child being raised by kin in formal foster care, 14 children were being raised by kin outside of foster care (informal kinship caregiving). Grandfamilies and kinship families offer a tremendous opportunity for vulnerable children/youth to grow up in safety and maintain family connections when their parents are unable or unwilling to care for them. Kinship caregivers open their hearts and home to a relative's child.\" (UW KinshipCareCA.org) Unlike parents, these caregivers often do not have inherent legal rights with respect to the children they raise, and they take informal responsibility for children suddenly with little time to plan for needs. The issue addressed is that kinship caregiving comes with unique challenges and a need for access to the right resources and support.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our program will enhance the Informal Kinship Caregivers in LAC by providing much needed connections to resources, technology education and tangible support to these families who would otherwise continue to struggle. Los Angeles County will have kinship caregivers who will grow in confidence using technology that will benefit them and the children left in their care throughout all sectors of their lives. Informal kinship caregiving as defined in question 6 above says that LAC's DCFS statistics of over 8,000 children formally being raised in kinship families means that 14 times this number, or 112,000 children, are being raised by kin outside of foster care informally. Through our Kinship Academy: short-term - we plan to support 40 households including 100 children in one year; long-term - we hope to scale this project by offering classes more frequently, setting a fixed syllabus, and engaging program 'graduates' to mentor their peers."

More children are reporting depression and anxiety than ever before, and the rate of teen suicide is rising. The U.S. Surgeon General and the AMA have issued emergency warnings about the need to act. Barriers to mental health care for children and youths include a finite number of trained child therapists, inadequate health insurance coverage for families with children, the inability of uninsured families to pay the cost of treatment, long wait lists for therapy, and stigma associated with mental illness that prevents some from seeking help. Research shows that child mindfulness therapy is effective for addressing depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems. By guiding children to practice mindfulness and strategies such as controlled breathing, they are better equipped to self-regulate, improving school readiness, socio-emotional competence, and improved family relationships.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "To address unmet needs for mental health care in LA County, our innovative approach builds upon our mindfulness-based preventive care program that we have delivered in Pasadena schools for 6 years. We will partner with public, parochial and charter schools, youth-serving agencies, and Anchor Children and Family Counseling to deliver mindfulness-based group and individual therapy in a private practice setting for up to 300 school-aged youths. We will fund 300 hours of direct clinical services, including up to 12, 50-minute individual therapy sessions for up to 25 clients; and up to 50, 6-session therapy groups of 8 clients each. The allocation of hours depends on the assessed needs of the client. Young & Healthy will conduct outreach and gather referrals from multiple sources, complete eligibility intakes, and make warm referrals to Anchor. This funding offers a rare opportunity to expand our services to youths in parochial and charter schools, many of whom suffer the same barriers to mental health care as their public-school counterparts. Unlike many school - clinician partnerships, Medi-Cal enrollment will not be required. Mindfulness-based therapy is shown to be effective with our target population because it can enhance opportunities for connection and buy-in from students and decrease mental health stigma. Our replicable approach can be a gateway to further care for youths and/or their families who need further care and initially express reluctance to attend \"therapy.\"",

We will conduct pre- and post- surveys of youths and parents to determine specific health impacts. We expect to show improvement in depressive symptoms, attention, and anxiety. These instruments will also measure and show youths' improved engagement in school, family, and community.

    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our intent is to expand the Social-Emotional Learning and Trauma-Informed Practices component of our program due to demand and need, and we will work with our school stakeholders and liaisons to engage with the students and parents who could most benefit from such programming. It is important to note that our approach is unique because we aim to create and train a cohort of youth who are skilled at trauma-informed and SEL practices, who can then serve as support systems to their peers. We understand that they will not provide counseling but instead provide tools (CBT, stress management, conflict resolution, positive relationship-building, grief management) to their peers. This approach has been developed, in part, due to our success and positive impact in training students in our peer mediation program. We have an MOU with Hawkins High School, an LAUSD School, to implement this work. We also seek to enhance our collaboration with the Los Angeles County Office of Education, with which we also have an MOU, to expand our professional development offerings to educators across the county. We also aim to expand our peace education app, \"Hear Me Out\" through our partnership with Hawkins High School, which has a gaming focus as one of its educational pathways.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "For the two collaborations listed in this proposal, the roles are as follows: HAWKINS HIGH SCHOOL The school has agreed to support project implementation for peer mediation, the peer-to-peer youth leaders in delivering support to each other, promote teacher professionals development, and offer our parenting series to parents with students at the school. They also agree to work with us to expand the peace education game. LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION We have mutually expressed interest in expanding our collaboration by offering more training sessions. We aim to schedule a monthly series on various peace education and social justice issues.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Rooted in restorative practices, the Domestic Harmonizer Program works with students, teachers and parents to build a deep understanding of conflict resolution education (CRE). By helping to create peaceful opportunities for exchange and learning, schools can reduce incidents of destructive conflict on campus. This approach helps schools focus on creating healthy learning environments. It also supports students in conflict to feel understood rather than punished. Our staff and consultants have degrees and experience in the fields of education, trauma-informed practices, applied theater, and peace and justice. Our team possesses a combined 70 years of experience working in schools and communities of varied cultures and backgrounds. We provide training to students, teachers, and parents. We also have our Domestic Harmonizer Virtual Center (www.domesticharmonizer.org) that helps us to engage with school stakeholders and provide our STEAM-based educational resources for free.",

While My Health LA has successfully enrolled over 94,000 uninsured residents, over 2 million individuals remain without coverage. The disparities in accessing mental health care among Latinos in LA County have reached unprecedented levels and are projected to worsen, particularly in areas that historically lack services for the uninsured and underinsured, such as South LA. For the Latino population, there has been a notable increase in rates of serious mental illness and major depressive episodes, indicating a need for mental health services.Treatment barriers, including stigma surrounding mental health disorders, language barriers, and a high rate of uninsured individuals, further impede access to care.Alarmingly, a substantial proportion of Latinos with serious mental illness or substance use disorders, approximately 56.8% and nearly 90% respectively, do not receive the needed treatment.",

We will establish a trusted cohort of promotores to educate the community, reduce mental health stigma, and connect individuals to vital health, mental health, and social services resources. Using a relational model, we enhance relationships, address treatment barriers, and promote equitable care. The NUNA Promotores cohort, trained in mental health and substance abuse, will support bilingual individuals and families with severe mental illness, guiding them to free or low-cost services. They will provide information on healthcare programs, legal residency/citizenship applications, and supportive services for social determinants of health. Through 12 full-day sessions, Promotores will learn about trauma-based disorders, intervention strategies, and actively support clients in accessing initial mental health appointments.

Quantitative measures include tracking the number of individuals served and Promotores' community education presentations. We will monitor Medi-Cal/CalAIM and My Health LA enrollments, denials, and disenrollments. Additionally, we will measure the number of completed Promotor programs and those becoming peer specialists. Qualitative insights will be gathered through surveys, assessing mistreatment, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate care experiences. Process measures such as outreach event numbers, training completion rate, and adherence to protocols will ensure program fidelity. Our ultimate success will be determined by outcome measures, reflecting positive impacts on well-being, quality of life, treatment plans, health outcomes, reduced disparities, increased knowledge and awareness, and enhanced self-efficacy among participants.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our vision for success is to create transformative impact by reducing disparities, increasing enrollment and access to services, fostering healing and self-reliance, and empowering community members in LA County's uninsured/underinsured Latino population. We aim to increase Medi-Cal/CalAIM or My Health LA enrollment and address barriers to healthcare access. Through trained Peer Specialist Promotoras, we will advocate for better care and champion reduced mistreatment. Our program offers bilingual treatment teams, eliminating wait times and improving access to quality care. A significant aspect of our vision is the empowerment of community members to join as Promotoras and become leaders in health equity within their own Latino communities. By building a sustainable network of peer specialists and/or Promotoras, specifically trained in fostering self-healing communities, we envision active engagement in improving their own healthcare access and outcomes."

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Persistent systemic issues have caused Black and brown students to have difficulty envisioning themselves as successful in traditional STEM subjects and in careers that lead to higher earning power and better quality of life. Students in high-poverty areas are less likely than peers to participate in hands-on science activities, and their teachers are less likely to have the materials needed to implement engaging science lessons. This disparity means Black and brown youth depend on outside programs to provide STEAM learning experiences. The complex reasons go significantly unaddressed by current education and nonprofit programming. The most pressing needs of social justice reform around equity and access along with the grand challenges of our time such as having clean water, controlling carbon emissions, and creating new patient-informed, culturally-mindful medicine and medical solutions all require STEAM-based solutions and all disproportionately affect Black and brown communities.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Currently, we track the success of our project both quantitatively and qualitatively. We use this data collected from the program teachers, students, and families throughout the program to measure students' attitudes and dispositions. We are most curious about if this program is strengthening students' creativity, agency, their ability to use STEAM skills to address social justice issues and if they feel inspired and motivated to continue learning about and solving the unmet needs in their communities. Pre and post program surveys allow us to measure the growth that takes place during a student or educator's time in one of our programs with nearly 80% of our student respondents reporting feeling confident in using STEAM to build power and 91% seeing themselves in STEAM. Additionally, of the educators, 90% leave our trainings feeling excited to teach their students our curriculum and 92% feel confident they can help their students make connections to our curriculum.",

Youth will have discovered the strength of their community and that they have the power and ability to create the world they want and deserve. In the long term, we envision a Los Angeles County where young people take an active role in this community development. Our youth must have the confidence and access to resources to not only recognize but also to address their communities' needs.

With support from LA2050, we will strengthen this program to continue to address issues of Black and brown student achievement in STEAM. PTS provides schools and youth-serving organizations with our innovative curriculum, exposing students to education pathways that can be used to uplift themselves and their communities. Students complete community-based projects such as using data analysis to create a more sustainable lunchroom or using coding to develop literacy games for kindergarten and first graders. Additionally, youth host family engagement nights where they lead workshops that expose their school community to culturally relevant STEAM. For example, students use VR to create a simulation of a social justice issue that they are passionate about. They design the simulation to educate their families and to inspire them to take action. Students learn how to take what they are learning and use it to uplift their school community. We currently serve 1,500 youth weekly through PTS. As a product of our programming, youth see an increase in their sense of belonging, agency, and identity.

Our partnerships have a proven track record of success; however, LA's current distribution landscape is fragmented, inefficient, and limited. With the help of the LA 2050 grant, The Pad Project can establish \"LAccess to Pads\" and become Los Angeles's leading provider, distributor, and educator for menstrual health. In December 2022, we started our local access program. Since then, we have distributed 2,600 menstrual kits, however, with limited staff, we cannot meet the increasing demand for products. To institute LAccess to Pads as LA County's Menstrual Health Hub, we need funds to expand in 3 areas: oversight, education, and distribution. First, we need to hire a dedicated staff member to liaise with LA-based organizations serving vulnerable populations, to monitor and evaluate our programs, to coordinate the purchase of products, and to facilitate product distribution. This staff member would also serve on California-based coalitions to promote menstrual equity legislation. Second, while we provide educational resources and offer leadership training for gender equity advocates; with increased funding, we can expand and tailor our LA-based programs to offer summits and workshops for communities, schools, and universities. Third, we would create 8,000 menstrual kits for low-income teens and families and increase the number of Angelenos we serve in year one.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our short term goal is to establish \"LAccess to Pads\" as LA's premier Menstrual Health (MH) Hub. Shelters, schools, and grassroots organizations would turn to The Pad Project's MH Hub to address their menstrual health needs. We will provide pads, tampons, menstrual cups, and underwear for vulnerable populations, including Asylum Seekers; offer educational resources, film screenings, and workshops; and support period positive policy and coalition building efforts. With the 2050 grant, we could increase the number of products we provide to our partners from 100,000 to 200,000 products and increase our own menstrual hygiene kit distribution from 2,500 to 8,000. Long term success for this grant would mean the eradication of menstrual stigma and period poverty for every Los Angeles resident. No student will miss school, no employee will suffer discrimination, and no person will have to choose between purchasing food or menstrual products on account of a natural biological cycle.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Although our organization has been providing products to vulnerable populations in developing countries since our inception, this grant would enable us to bring our sizeable network home to pilot a distribution program and establish \"LAccess to Pads,\" a local hub for menstrual health (MH) resources. We would monitor and evaluate our LA Hub in the same way as our US programs, by requiring each of our partners to provide data on the number of products purchased and distributed, and the number of persons served. Additionally, we calculate the number of kits that we pack and distribute ourselves. Since we do not have the resources we can only collect data on broad outcomes. Your grant will enable us to back our qualitative data with quantitative analysis.This year, product donations requests have tripled.

The morning after accepting the Oscar, our founder woke to a flood of emails. One read: \"I cried when I watched the little girls who had never seen a pad. I grew up in Compton and, as a 13-year-old, my family had no money for pads, so I made pads out of old socks.\" It was then we decided to provide access to products here at home. The Pad Project partners with NGOs, schools, and shelters to provide access to menstrual products in 15 countries and 26 states.

ZWK will increase access to affordable, organic, bulk goods; reduce greenhouse gas emissions; reduce packaging waste; and create a neighborhood meeting. It will demonstrate that ecological amenities and organic food should be available to underserved communities that already live sustainable lifestyles, not just wealthy Angelenos. ZWK will sell bulk dry goods, organic produce, beauty products, home goods, and cleaning products. Studies show that low-income people prefer organic groceries but are less likely to buy them because of the cost. ZWK will keep prices accessible by buying bulk goods wholesale and reselling them without packaging. Low-income communities and people of color have disproportionately higher levels of exposure to harmful toxins in household products, and safer products are often too expensive. ZWK will help change residents' shopping habits while sharing information on safer products, reuse, and recycling practices. Inventory will be responsive to local cuisines and needs, offering goods that are not available at other refilleries. Customers will use reusable containers for bulk items, helping to divert waste away from streets and landfills and reduce emissions associated with packaging materials. ZWK will also be a community space for reuse-focused events like repair workshops, swap parties, cooking classes, and gardening.",

It will reinforce the sense of environmental stewardship that is already present in the community. ZWK will host activities promoting repair, reuse, and cost savings. The store may sell repurposed and upcycled items such as clothing and furniture at affordable prices, or host swaps for neighbors to exchange unwanted items. Community members will be invited to share their skills by teaching workshops on sewing, mending, fixing electronics, gardening, and other eco-friendly activities. This space would benefit the neighborhood by making ecological and creative reuse activities more inclusive and welcoming. Like bulk stores, spaces like this exist in LA, but they serve higher-income residents. ZWK will be led by longtime residents who understand community needs, and will include programming in commonly spoken languages.",

It is only open to housing co-op members and has limited hours, so there is demand from neighbors for a public-facing store. ZWK will build on the Food Lobby's model, using some of their processes and their relationships with suppliers. ZWK will define success as maintaining steady sales and regular open hours, so that the project can continue past the grant period. We will track sales, volunteers, and participants at our community events. To ensure that ZWK is responsive to community needs, we will invite feedback through surveys, suggestion boxes, and discussions at events. Feedback will touch on what to stock, prices, programming, and how the space could be more welcoming.

As a low-income neighborhood facing environmental burdens, Koreatown would benefit from an affordable bulk store. Residents of majority low-income communities of color are rarely seen as environmentally conscious despite their contributions, and they are excluded from environmental benefits. Local stores sell primarily packaged goods that create excessive plastic waste. Buying organic bulk staples is impossible, and many struggle to balance the costs of food and rent.

Currently, we are building a community-designed park in a High Need neighborhood in South L.A. on an empty median; this new park will connect with the Tot Lot we completed in 2020 on an abandoned partial parcel across the street. We recently planted 52 new street trees along pedestrian corridors connecting residents and commuters to L.A. City College and helped maintain our urban tree canopy's health by trimming overgrown trees throughout the City of L.A. We are now partnering with community members and the County Dept. of Public Health to create pedestrian plans in unincorporated neighborhoods to promote healthier walking environments with increased shade; we are in the process of adding school greening and green alley projects to our portfolio; and, we are always communicating with community members to identify new potential park and greening projects. LANI will continue to engage and empower historically disenfranchised people to plan and build more parks and green spaces in their under-served neighborhoods, creating tangible health and quality of life benefits, block by block.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Parks, green spaces and tree canopy are essential infrastructure with significant, proven benefits to people's physical and mental health. However according to the L.A. Countywide Parks & Recreation Needs Assessment, 51% of residents do not live within a 1/2 mile radius of a park. The majority of neighborhoods with High to Very High park need are home primarily to people who are low-income and/or people of color. A recent study by UCLA public health researchers found that increasing park space in every park-poor L.A. County census tract to the current median of 54 acres per tract would dramatically increase longevity among predominantly Black and Latino residents and help reduce current health disparities in the region. Mental health is also significantly related to residential distance from parks (Sturm & Cohen). L.A. County's current lack of park equity contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes for people in under-served neighborhoods.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "There is ample research to prove that the addition of new parks and green spaces to neighborhoods that are \"park poor\" or \"high need\" has many positive impacts for local residents, including on their physical and mental health. So, our measure of impact is the simple addition of parks and green spaces, project by project, neighborhood by neighborhood. For the purposes of this project, LANI will identify at least 3 new park or greening project opportunities. These may include pocket parks, tot lots, or green open recreational spaces on city-owned land or right of ways, green alleys, or school greening projects. We will also work with at least 6 new local leaders, community groups, nonprofit organizations, or individual community members to identify park needs and opportunities and strategize with them about how to make the opportunities into realities. Engaging in robust project pre-development is the first step to adding much needed green open and recreational space in the County."

STOKED has partnered with not-for-profit and for-profit organizations in California to provide STOKED students from LA County with surfing experiences. We found that we were limited by how many students we could serve because access to surf instructors was limited. Many of our students could not imagine themselves participating because they never saw surfers that looked like them. At most, we were able to provide four days of surfing during the months of July because of the limited availability of surf instructors. If we had access to surfers during the school year, we could seamlessly integrate the experience throughout the year, as we do with skateboarding.",

We prioritize child and family safety, as many 90813 parks (including the park where our garden is located) are challenged by large homeless encampments, public drug use, vandalism, and the destruction of public bathrooms. Such dangers keep families from coming out on the weekends to enjoy their local parks. Instead of visiting local parks, families either stay at home, or are forced to drive to parks in affluent neighborhoods.

Our intended impact is to engage more youth in our Busy Hands = Busy Minds concept (using open-ended conversations and hands-on activities to enhance creativity and improve critical thinking and comprehension skills). We also offer paid internship opportunities to high school and college student, who request our organization for job references or letters of recommendation for graduate school.

An estimated 88% of county households across all income brackets are \"cost-burdened,\" or spending 30-50% of income on rent or mortgage payments. Those facing housing instability, eviction, and homelessness are heavily concentrated in Black and Latino communities. The shortage of housing also stems from the lack of houses being built in recent decades, and state and regional policies now require local governments to plan for 341,000 homes that are affordable to low and very low-income people by 2030. Meanwhile, congregations across the County are sitting on land that has been underutilized as membership continues to decline. LA Voice is using this opportunity to meet some of the challenges of affordable housing production and supply and provide a source of income for congregations so that they can continue to serve the community.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We address the root causes of the affordable housing shortage in the county and statewide-a confluence of systemic racism, lack of sufficient production, poor policy choices, and the use of real estate as a commodity vs. a \"human right\" or basic need, among others. Through our network of faith-based organizations and partners, LA Voice facilitates this work with congregations, addresses zoning barriers to development on congregational land, and conducts grassroots organizing that engages community members in advocating to their government. Another strategy is combating NIMBY attitudes (ie, \"Not In My Backyard,\" or opposition to neighborhood change) through education and testimonials from people who are impacted. Lastly, by facilitating the adoption of an overlay zone that would allow congregations to build by-right on their land, we can move Los Angeles County to remove barriers for thousands of faith-based organizations to build affordable housing on their property.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Faith in Housing program helps congregations have affordable and permanent supportive housing on their property by identifying sites and guiding vision, site analysis and feasibility studies, and developer selection. Our strategy focuses on the development of multifamily housing from 50 to 150 units by negotiating between land-owning Faith Based Organizations and developers. In addition, the program also seeks to build Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), or secondary residential units between 500 and 1,200 sq ft, that are expansions or free-standing structures sharing lots with larger residences. The ADU strategy builds on new State bills that encourage this inherently low-cost housing type. Utilizing existing parsonages and parking lots to develop ADUs more expediently increases affordable housing availability. To date, the program is working closely with 22 congregations with an estimated housing yield of 1,851 units. In addition, the program has successfully identified locations for 153 units of ADUs and ADU types on 18 different land parcels. By year's end, the program's goal is to help at least five new and five existing congregations discern and/or negotiate with development partners to create affordable housing-and to have signed agreements with developers and/or congregations for 300 units of housing to include a minimum of 30 ADUs or ADU types. A minimum of 100 of the units will be part of projects serving congregations of color in South Los Angeles and Compton."

Street Company strongly believes we are suited to address the needs of our priority population with a three-pronged approach: (1) vocational training and job placement, (2) case management, and (3) supportive services. SC has been conducting empowerment projects to roast coffee beans, providing support groups, vocational trainings, and supportive services for over 8 years. In July 2022, SC launched the wholesale coffee roasting social enterprise, \"Caster Coffee\". Since July, Casters Coffee is selling beans to businesses and SC has remained committed to use 100% of coffee sales revenue to employ homeless people. SC has developed a strong training team of 5 people with lived experience, acquired a training and roasting facility, launched a successful coffee brewing and roasting business, and case management system.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "SC has been providing services to the community for over 8 years - starting with \"The General Assembly\" weekly support group at a park in Lancaster which initiated formally in Sept 2016. SC served roughly 50 homeless individuals per week from 2016 to 2020 through these direct services. Due to the pandemic, these services became limited. SC has expertise in providing employment and job trainings in a coffee roasting manufacturing setting. In 2018, SC provided 6 months coffee brewing lessons and basic job trainings to 6 homeless individuals. In 2019, 4 individuals successfully completed the training program and participated in coffee catering services. The homeless coffee catering team served coffee at nearly 60 public events throughout LA. Since 2019, SC has provided case management services and support to homeless individuals - linking to medical and treatment facilities, self-sufficiency, and housing services. SC is changing the homeless community and LA County immensely.",

As we've worked closer with schools, it became clear that while introducing work, entrepreneurship, leadership and engagement to students in school is vital, very few in the education community understand what the local economy looks like, what pathways exist, or how to prepare young people to navigate beyond school. Essentially, educators are charged with preparing students without context themselves. With this initiate we aim to correct this, establishing stronger connective tissue for the ecosystem.

Cultivating Creators will focus on a wide variety of highly applicable skills for creative industry careers--workshop and tool safety, woodworking, sculpting, mold making, soft foam fabrication, patternmaking, sewing, basic electronics, painting and finishing techniques, and mechanization, all with an eye toward making an inanimate project come to life. Karina De La Cruz is just one member of the BBMT community that exemplifies the potential of this apprenticeship program, and its capacity to uplift women of color. Beginning in 2018 as a volunteer while studying animation at CSULA, Karina began to come weekly to the BBMT workshop. At first pulling puppets and props and doing basic painting, she eventually moved into more specific fabrication training, all free of cost. Karina worked towards her degree and continued to develop her fabrication skills, and was eventually offered employment in the theater--she graduated last month, and is now a part-time puppeteer and part-time fabricator. Thus far, the apprenticeship program has existed as a combination of part-time staff and eager volunteers, but with funding and additional outreach to underserved communities, BBMT hopes to formalize Cultivating Creators, expanding its impact and creating sustainable structures for its future.",

Professional roles in fabrication, building, and associated skills represent a stark gender and race gap--the BBMT apprenticeship program will create ripples in LA and beyond, eradicating barriers to entry. A long-term goal for the program is the building of intentional partnerships, such as with LAUSD and CSULA (with whom we are discussing a recruitment program), understanding that opportunities for creative engagement may be few and far between, before anyone ever encounters BBMT. By instilling awareness of the apprenticeship program, young people from the LA's public institutions (which serve a majority BIPOC population) are invited to participate, rather than expected to extensively seek out this sort of training, which is often elusive and exclusionary.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The BBMT (Bob Baker Marionette Theater) Cultivating Creators apprenticeship program directly addresses major gender and race disparities in the artistic realm. Although US data indicates that working artists represent a roughly 50/50 male/female split, careers in craftsmanship are 88% male/12% female, and exhibit building is a stark 93% male/7% female. What is more, the same data indicates that workers in the artistic field are nearly two-thirds white. (Source: Zippia) On some level, this is unsurprising, given the high cost of living in cities like Los Angeles, the many institutional barriers to entry for creative careers, the prioritization of hiring those that come from elite educational spaces, as well as general socio-economic racism, which inhibits access to the development of a creative practice. Cultivating Creators seeks to combat this by providing free-of-cost and paid hands-on training in puppetry and fabrication at one of today's most renowned marionette theaters.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Apprenticeship has been a critical part of the theater's ethos since its founding, training over 100 puppeteers and artistic professionals. When the theater moved locations in 2019, BBMT officially created a new workshop department and embedded apprenticeship into the theater's operating model. Since then, BBMT has trained 15 aspiring puppeteers and artists, two thirds of them women (including Karina De La Cruz, mentioned earlier.) Impact is measured not only by these diversity factors, but by tangible movement from trainee to professional. Just this year, 2 trainees were hired as puppeteers in the theater, and in the last 5 years, theater staff has grown exponentially--there are now 7 full-time and 16 part-time employees, all with livable wages. Cultivating Creators will continue to define success by such measures, and will work intentionally to recruit widely, gather demographic data, and ensure that professional pathways are being filled by those traditionally left out of them.",

This economic disparity is experienced acutely in Northwest Pasadena (zip code 91103), where there is a near 30% child poverty rate (Huntington Hospital). According to the Justice Equity Needs Index (JENI) - a means to measure the disparate burden of criminalization and inequities- Pasadena's 91103 zip code has the highest overall need level (Catalyst California, 2022). Research indicates that: (1) initial contact and involvement with the justice system is associated with an increased likelihood of school dropout, trauma, and substance use (2) young people who do not have stable jobs by their early twenties are at greater risk for joblessness and lower lifetime earnings."

We also track wellness outcomes through student profiles, which include their grades, disciplinary reports, and overall behavior check ins with teachers and the deans. Since enrolling in our school community, families experiencing housing instability and system impacted youth have been connected to services to provide safe living accommodations and transportation when needed.",

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Support for Foster and Systems-Impacted Youth",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The vision for Crete Academy came after our founder, Dr. Hattie Mitchell, witnessed a child crawling through the streets of Skid Row with their disconnected mother beside them. Dr. Mitchell was heartbroken by this harsh reality and dedicated her life to creating a school to support children and families living in hardship. Crete Academy was established in 2016 to interrupt the cycle of poverty through education and wellness services. Of the total amount of unhoused people in Los Angeles County, one of the highest concentrations is in the South Central region. Today, 30% of the student population at Crete is experiencing active homelessness, and 95% of students live at or below the poverty line. Homelessness impacts a young person's academic performance, physical health, mental well-being, and ability to achieve upward economic mobility. Students systemically affected by poverty, housing instability, and family instability are more likely to be truant and fall behind academically.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "At Crete Academy, ensuring a child's success goes beyond assisting students academically. This grant will go directly to funding our existing Wellness Program. Based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, the Crete Model and our Wellness Program are designed to provide services to both children and caregivers to disrupt the cycle of poverty through holistic care and resources. The specific services that this grant will support are counseling services for system-impacted students and daily school transportation. Our Wellness Program also provides students with resources such as character workshops, group therapy, and individualized care to address student-specific needs. A portion of this grant will also give us the capacity to renew contracts and expand our mental health services by onboarding an additional licensed clinical social worker at Crete. The grant will also fund transportation through Crete's partner Hop Skip Drive. Crete Academy has 6.8% of students chronically absent in 2021/22 compared to 30% of students reported chronically absent in the state. Many families that use transportation in Crete are experiencing houselessness, and it is their student's only way to get to school. In LAUSD, almost 70% of homeless students and almost 60% of students in foster care were chronically absent in 2021/22. Crete Academy's Wellness Program directly benefits system impacted youth by providing transportation and counseling services so students receive an equitable education.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Every child, despite their circumstances, has the potential to become a prominent leader in Los Angeles and the greater United States. Crete not only supports youth break the cycle of poverty but also equips students with the character, education, and network to be the next generation of effective change makers. When successful, we see uplifted families, low absentee rates, and high graduation rates for system impacted youth. Two thirds of the homeless youth in LA County are in the City of LA. While we primarily serve students living in South Central, the ultimate goal is eliminating childhood homelessness in the City of LA and the rest of LA County. Every child deserves a quality education and the ability to learn in a safe, healthy, and supportive environment. Children are our future, and when organizations like Crete Academy lay the foundation for homelessness prevention, LA County is closer to establishing long-term solutions to today's crises.",

With the passage of Proposition 28, California public schools are required to use public funding to develop arts programs. While Prop 28 brings opportunities for investment, the demand for practicing artists who are trained educators exceeds the number of teaching artists available. With our experience providing arts programs and robust professional development initiatives, P.S. ARTS is uniquely positioned to help schools harness this opportunity.",

Ethnic minorities, immigrants, and the homeless are especially impacted and don't always apply for these resources due to multiple barriers, including complexities of the application process and systems, lack of understanding of eligibility rules, language, literacy, misinformation, transportation and technology access, climates of fear and mistrust, and stigmas. Furthermore, ongoing changes with public benefit programs such as Medi-Cal and CalFresh cause additional confusion. Moreover, about one in ten California households lack the resources to meet their food needs, with a greater disproportionate number of people of color.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Since the Affordable Care Act was introduced, we have seen improved health care access and a lower rate of preventable hospital stays - something that can be very costly for people experiencing poverty. Social support is also identified as a key component of strong psychological health. However, more remains to be done for vulnerable populations. StLRS' one stop wraparound model has proven effective in reducing the number of people living in poverty without access to these critical benefits. In July 2023, we will begin implementing a Strategic Plan that will guide the organization's direction for the next 3 years, focusing in 4 strategic goals: 1) Improve organizational capacity and ensure effectiveness; 2) Enhance awareness in communities about StLRS; 3) Refine programs and deliverables; and 4) Expand and diversify revenue.

The use of crystal methamphetamine which is often mixed with other drugs does nothing to support a person becoming housed or stable enough to look for work. We visualize the support of more Sober Living as being a means of supporting more chronically homeless people seeking residential care and having a supportive place to go once they finish residential treatment. At sober living residents learn to put into practice showing up for recovery, showing up for work, learning to live on budget, and stay away from patterns of behavior that have caused relapse or drug/alcohol use in past.

The more units of sober living we can support the more we can move people from chronic homelessness into sober supportive housing- this housing is also supported through on-going aftercare including ongoing sessions with psychologist for an additional six months to insure continuity with employment, recovery, housing, budget and other support. Sometimes new traumas are revealed as a resident stays sober; it is important that the resident knows they can always come back and share in a safe supportive way and learn that yet another trauma revealed and healthy tools to work through these uncomfortable patterns of behavior are dealt with in socially supportive therapeutic way. Many who are drug addicts and alcoholics have been taking medications which were prescribed while they were under the influence and or using - this makes getting an accurate diagnosis difficult we support the residents to get an honest and thorough assessment now that they are sober and in recovery.

We have changed our program over time going from 90 days the first 32 years to 6 months the last 18 years - crystal methamphetamine changed the amount of time it took for psychosis to minimize enough for treatment tools to begin to make sense and be utilized. The brain takes time after stopping crystal meth use to be able to function - initially residents must be told things over and over.

The trained MiHA ambassadors implement the educational component and following this, a post-education survey is administered. This survey will work to assess the impact that the educational component of the intervention made on the participants.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The issue we seek to address is the high rate of injuries to bicyclists in Los Angeles County, particularly at some of the most dangerous intersections, including multi-lane diagonal intersections. In these areas, cyclists are forced to ride alongside traffic and struggle to be noticed by other vehicles, which puts them at a higher risk of getting into collisions that result in severe injuries. The data reveals the urgency of the problem, with 1,813 bicycle accidents and 27 tragic deaths reported in Los Angeles County in 2021 alone, according to TIMS (Traffic Incident Management System). By equipping bicyclists with loud digital bells, we provide a more effective way for them to make their presence known to other road users. These devices are crucial in keeping cyclists safe by enhancing their \"visibility\" and communication with surrounding vehicles. Addressing this issue is vital to improve cyclist safety and reduce avoidable injuries and casualties on our roads.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If our work through Operation Elephant is successful, LA County will be a safer place to play via bicycling. We hope that the digital bells give Angelenos the confidence to bike recreationally and experience all the mental and physical health benefits of biking for pleasure. In the short term, we will see enhanced cyclist safety through this innovative approach by ensuring each bicyclist can effectively gain the attention of road traffic, reducing the risk of collisions and promoting safer road interactions. These bells will serve as a proactive safety measure, alerting drivers to the presence of cyclists. Additionally, Operation Elephant will increase awareness of cyclists' need for improved communication with other road users. In the long term, we aim to cultivate a cultural shift where using digital bells becomes a standard safety practice in LA County. Thus instilling the understanding that bicyclists are legitimate road users who deserve attention and respect.",

The team will measure outcomes by having recipients complete a digital survey to provide feedback on the bell, indicate whether they have traditionally felt comfortable riding with traffic, and express the extent to which the bell will make them more confident and safe on the road. The team will continue to track how many digital bike bells and bilingual safety flyers are handed out at each tabling event, Chapter event, and large distribution. BikeLA conducts several distribution events throughout the year, including our widely successful Operation Firefly/Operacion Luciernaga program, which has provided over 15,000 free bike lights to Angelenos since 2012.

By providing bicyclists with digital bells closer in volume and sound to a car horn, we can help prevent crashes. Each recipient will receive a bilingual informational flyer in English and Spanish with safety information, including bell etiquette. We survey all recipients to collect data and distribute the bells in the following ways: Two Large Distributions: We will organize two major distribution events near LA's high-injury network and transportation hubs, engaging the entire team and creating impactful community events. One distribution will occur in winter, and the other in summer, ensuring year-round coverage and accessibility. Tabling Events: Throughout the year, we will distribute the bells during tabling events such as CicLAvia (9 events), Finish the Ride, Golden Streets Ride, and Sunset4All. BikeLA Chapter System Engagement: We will make the bells readily available to our countywide Chapters. This will enable individual chapters to access the bells and distribute them at events like Bike Culver City's Pride Ride. This decentralized approach will expand the reach and impact of the project. These activities ensure the widespread distribution of the bells and educational materials, targeting key events where bicyclists gather and providing ongoing support to our chapters."

AWH takes place outside, where our students & their families can appreciate nature & reap those therapeutic benefits. Each year we have over 300 volunteers participate, which creates a sense of community. Retirees are given a sense of purpose. Middle, High School, & college students complete mandatory community service hours.

It will be our Forever Home where they can come and feel safe, secure, & loved. AWH strives to create a community for all of our students, volunteers, & staff. Many have stayed with the program for decades and considers it their 2nd family. Spending time with the horses improves their mental well-being. Being in a safe space where they are not seen for their disability, but as an individual, increases self-esteem and self-confidence. Having more people who are happy with themselves means they will be kinder to others.

Our current Family Partnership Model addresses barriers to financial stability and breaking the cycle of generational poverty, but it does not dive deeper into the trauma that these families have experienced. Without addressing the underlying cause of mental disorders and stress associated with life-changing events, such as experiencing homelessness, it will be difficult for our families to fully feel empowered and capable of maintaining stability in their new environment.

In addition, we believe in the power of art and culture to heal and inspire hope, especially for the youth. Adding cultural activities and classes such as acting, dance, yoga and painting, will fill this gap within our community. We recently started acting classes at Missouri Place and it has been such an exciting and empowering activity for the participating youth.

Families who partner with Imagine LA maintain their housing, access living-wage career tracks, and build an overall solid foundation for family wellbeing. The intensive housing retention support that Imagine LA provides is proven to keep families from slipping back into homelessness. Adding an on-site mental health professional for a weekly support group will address the trauma and mental health issues encountered in these underserved populations. In addition, the arts and cultural activities will be able to reach the \"whole family\" with a focus on youth, creating a ripple impact for future generations.

Youth attend for up to eight hours per week (30 hours a week in summer), encompassing group classes and 1:1 engagement focused on core academics, literacy, therapies, and STEAM intervention. At the end of each 10-week session, each student presents their own graduation speech by memory in front of hundreds of people, showcasing their development of confidence and public speaking skills. Many of its students share how they aspire to work within the STEAM field. STEAM programming is an important aspect of our curriculum. Our specialized deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) teachers focus on the development of critical thinking skills, math, engineering by designing and performing experiments, evaluating data, and sharing results. This includes topics for its students to understand their own hearing loss. For example, our deaf youth learn about their own hearing loss, including reading their audiograms, which enables them to be active in conversations and decision-making where their hearing loss intersects with their educational and social needs. They also learn about sound waves and vibrations, the difference between frequency and pitch, and how decibels, amplification and volume differ.

Deaf youth are given little to no access to after-school programs for college readiness, leadership, and advocacy. Sadly, deaf students are pushed through the school system and received little support. The impact of inequity cannot be overstated. Most deaf youth need academic intervention as a result of their language delays. No Limits fills in the void through its STEAM program which provides critical problem-solving and life skills that can make them competitive in the workforce. STEAM serves as an important source of language, cognitive, intellectual, and social development.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "A grant award from LA2050 would be used towards building our trauma-informed enhancement/improvement project for our housing program. This is a three-part project that involves 1) conducting capital needs assessments of all three of our shelter sites; 2) addressing needed repairs at these sites; and 3) providing trauma-informed enhancements informed by our clients' and staff's needs. The specific shelter sites impacted by this project do not have names, but we can share their addresses: 1552 W 82nd Street Los Angeles, CA 90047; 1554 W 82nd Street Los Angeles, CA 90047; and 416 E 84th Street Los Angeles, CA 90003. All three sites are located within South Los Angeles. The 90047 locations are in the Manchester Square neighborhood and the 90003 location is in the Florence neighborhood. The total number of unaccompanied, adult beds impacted through this project is 55. The overall impact that we plan for this project to have on our sites and our clients is to provide upgrades that make the sites feel much more like homes and less like shelters, especially for our clients who are mothers and children. We have a number of smaller projects under the umbrella of this larger project that will help us make our sites more welcoming and comfortable.",

According to the 2022 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, there were 69,144 homeless people, with 70.2% unsheltered. The number of homeless individuals increased by 4% from 2020. In South Los Angeles, where NOAH's Foundation shelters are located, the statistics are even more concerning: in 2022, there was a 12% increase in homelessness. 61% were unsheltered. Our proposal is a rapid response and a time urgent need because everyday the number of people experiencing homelessness increases, due to a variety of factors including mental health issues, medical debt and job loss. Through our services, we are empowering families to not only live their lives with dignity and purpose, but we are showing them that they are valued and important just as they are. And that they are not defined by their circumstances.",

This project would improve and enhance the housing environment to create dignified living conditions for all. We're creating a psychologically restful atmosphere that feels like home: clients have the privacy, space, and safety they need to rejuvenate and recharge as they work through the most challenging of circumstances. We know that the shelter experience is stressful and frustrating, especially for children. Shelters often do not have the kinds of play areas that children need to get their energy out and enjoy themselves. Children need a safe place that they can call home for proper mental, physical, and emotional development; if the place that they live is only designed for adults, children can feel out of place & unsafe, causing additional trauma.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "For NOAH's Foundation, we will know we have reached success when we have achieved the following milestones: Provided safe and affordable housing to identified individuals and families between the ages of 18-32. ? Provide secure and stable housing for 200 individuals, including families and children across 10 homes and 37 rooms. ? As needed, offer up to 3 months free rent to housing insecure individuals in support of moving them from homelessness to self-sufficiency ? Provide high quality case management and housing services that support all residents at various stages of their transition"

Of key concern is disparity of access and use of open space and natural areas by low-income communities and economic paths for reversing the disparity. Linking Angelenos to the environment for the benefit of wildlife, people, and natural areas that remain is essential. By making this connection, residents will appreciate and care for nature in their city and beyond. Meaningful experiences in nature and preparing youth to become environmental stewards for future environmental and climate challenges is key. Workforce development is cited as a parks-related anti-displacement strategy that protects communities, making the Fellows program an opportunity to connect youth to STEM education, job training, and nature while uplifting River-adjacent communities at risk of gentrification.",

This hostility reflects the environment outside of school in our polarized political and social media culture. Fortunately, there is a proven way to build compassion and inclusion in our classrooms. A study in the UK of students aged 9-15 demonstrated that learning about Anne Frank and the Holocaust is highly effective in addressing not only antisemitism, but prejudice in general. Furthermore, a 2020 study by Lucid Collaborative LLC and YouGov shows that Holocaust education in high school resulted in more empathetic, tolerant, and engaged students. In fact, when presented with a bullying scenario, the students who had experienced Holocaust education reported being more likely to offer help and were 50% less likely to do nothing."

A decrease in healthcare inequality is anticipated, as the initiative will bridge the \"treatment gap\" that prevents unhoused individuals from accessing necessary services. With success, evidence gathered from this project will be utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of an integrated Occupational Therapy and street medicine approach. This could influence and encourage the allocation of more resources towards similar programs, expanding the reach of this care model to more unhoused individuals in the county and beyond.",

Our innovative approach uses the principles of \"street medicine,\" enabling us to bring holistic, patient-centric OT services directly to the individuals where they are, be it in parks, shelters, or outside their tents. By doing so, HIA circumvents the typical barriers to healthcare faced by homeless individuals. Occupational therapists will provide evidence-based interventions such as activity-based, cognitive-behavioral, and vocational rehabilitation therapies, designed to promote engagement in meaningful activities, enhance occupational performance, and improve overall health and well-being. Our approach embodies a trauma-informed lens and a harm reduction model, building trust, promoting safe environments, and directly addressing the health inequities faced by the homeless. As part of the holistic care package, HIA also provides mental health services, social services, and housing navigation. The team uses a mobile clinic van as a meeting place to conduct services. The OT will work with our therapist and case managers to provide wraparound behavioral health services.

Many people experiencing homelessness face challenges with daily tasks, healthcare management, and engaging in meaningful activities because of barriers to accessing important services. This, coupled with the complexities of homelessness, often results in reduced occupational performance and poor well-being. By incorporating Occupational Therapy (OT), tailored, evidence-based interventions are offered directly to those who need it the most, improving health outcomes and quality of life. OT interventions have been found to be effective in addressing substance use and promoting recovery and well-being for individuals with SUD. OT interventions can have positive effects on a range of outcomes for individuals with substance use, including improved occupational performance, reduced substance use, and increased social participation.

Evidence-based assessment called the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is used to establish treatment areas and build goals that are patient driven. This will begin with a thorough intake conducted by a substance use clinician that assesses patient's substance use. Based on the intake, a treatment plan will be developed. Assessments will depend on the type of substance use endorsed by patients. Accessibility is a main goal in street medicine and clients should be involved in goal setting for treatment plans. Therapy will be a collaborative effort. Clinicians will assess each session for changes in substance use and attitudes towards use. Clinicians will always employ a harm reduction approach to ensure that patients maintain agency throughout their SUD treatment.",

This program will allow us to expand our ongoing successful supportive service model that has over 40 years of success in ending the cycle of domestic violence and finding permanent housing for these families. This includes: an environment of safety, a solid security plan in place for the physical safety of the families; on-site crisis intervention; adequate therapeutic support; their housing search outside of the geographic vulnerable area where the abuser resides. We take a comprehensive approach and also provide public benefits advocacy, job training, childcare, goal setting, crisis intervention, counseling, budgeting, and permanent housing placement. We support our mission by taking every step possible to ensure the well-being of our clients and help them achieve freedom and control over their own lives that gives them a sense of dignity and hope for the future for themselves and their children.",

There is no question the employment problems facing those returning from prison, living in homelessness and for opportunity youth are more dire than ever. ManifestWorks' ability to move our alumni into living-wage employment will impact individuals, families and communities. Not only will we help cut reliance reliance on welfare and move people out of poverty, but we actively help build wealth to create generational opportunities. Our curriculum includes extensive financial literacy instruction and a new program makes all alumni eligible for a savings and investment class where we will match $1,000 of habitual alumni savings with stock market investment account designed for habitual investments, connecting alumni to passive wealth acquisition. Our next program will focus on helping alumni move towards real estate acquisition.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Income Inequality",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "ManifestWorks was born from an understanding that those impacted by foster care, incarceration and homelessness are often blocked from the very opportunities that could help them escape the long-term impacts of system involvement and generational poverty. Our earliest champions were connected by decades advocating for foster and justice-involved children, and united in their advocacy for those locked up in California prisons. Finding opportunity and a way to sidestep the steep barriers to a healthy future was the original vision of ManifestWorks. Since 2014, we have found the cycles of institutionalization can be overcome with access to living-wage jobs, meaningful mentorships, and a robust, supportive network that allows alumni to bring their best to work. To date, ManifestWorks has connected hundreds of alumni to living-wage careers, seeded thousands of freelance jobs and as many relationships for sustaining employment.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our workforce-development organization creates a direct pathway to living-wage jobs for those impacted by foster care, incarceration, and homelessness. We know living-wage jobs transform lives profoundly, but the barriers to employment for our participants make finding a job - even a low-paying one - insurmountable without the intervention we provide. Well-paying jobs with upward mobility have immediate and transformative impacts on our participants, their families and their communities. Those completing ManifestWorks see their wages rise an average of 400 percent within one year of being accepted. We see dramatic reductions in the reliance on public benefits of all kinds, and we see significant markers to demonstrate wealth acquisition, measured around access to banking, increased savings and improved levels of home ownership, all information demonstrated against baseline surveys collected by applicants. Significantly, none of our active alumni have ever returned to prison.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "We currently operate three lacrosse programs catering to different age groups. Our first program focuses on introducing lacrosse to middle school-aged girls and boys. We provide comprehensive support, including funding for coaching, equipment, league fees, field space and officiating. By offering these resources, we aim to create a nurturing environment that encourages the growth and skill development of young lacrosse players, a truly recreational lacrosse experience. We transition them into our high school-aged program. Here, we continue to provide support and guidance, ensuring that they have access to quality coaching, equipment, and opportunities to participate in off-season tournaments. We believe in fostering a competitive spirit while instilling important values such as teamwork and sportsmanship. We recently helped to establish a community college lacrosse program to expand collegiate lacrosse opportunities in the area. This program aims to provide a seamless transition for high school players into collegiate club lacrosse while pursuing a college degree. With the help of the grant, we can expand our programs further. The funds will be used to provide coaching stipends, purchase equipment, tournament participation, secure field space and team insurance. Our middle school program will help form a rec league of non profit lacrosse teams that will include Black Star Lacrosse Club and Harlem Lacrosse.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In south and central Glendale as well as other, there exists a pressing need for more accessible and affordable field space and opportunities to try new and different sports. Unfortunately, some children face financial constraints that prevent them from affording lacrosse equipment or the fees typically associated with joining a club team. These financial barriers hinder their ability to explore new sports. Underprivileged children often encounter additional challenges including mental health challenges, we see fractured family situations, parents or caregivers juggling multiple jobs, and a lack of consistent adult mentors during critical periods of their lives. Lacrosse, known as the Medicine (healing) Game, offers a suitable platform for children to address both physical and mental obstacles. Moreover, as a team sport, it fosters a sense of unity and community among the players and their coach mentors. Playing together often means we get along with others.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We are primarily measuring the impact by the retention within our program, i.e., seeing which kids are continuing to play lacrosse. At the high school level, 75% of those who continue to play started with our middle school program (50 of 70). Program expansion focus is at the middle school and high school levels, where we believe the need is the greatest. We want to increase our current participation level from 30 middle schoolers to 60. We also want to increase our current high school level from 70 participants to 90. At the community we would like to increase our participation from 15 to 30 with the goal of at least 40 participants (an ideal balance of 20 young women and 20 young men). In the past, participants have been interviewed as to why do they play lacrosse. The friendships and camaraderie are important to our participants, often supporting one another starting from the middle school years. Participants, parents and supporters will continue to be interviewed.",

This leads to improved participant's athleticism, physical fitness and self confidence. Personal growth: They'll learn important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, perseverance and effective coping skills, fostering emotional resilience and enhancing mental health. Community engagement/cohesion: Families, friends and supporters come together to attend events, creating a sense of community and camaraderie. The social connections and networks developed through these programs improve mental well-being and a sense of belonging. College opportunities: A community college lacrosse program provides a pathway for high school players to continue their lacrosse journey at the collegiate level. This contributes to improved mental health by giving players motivation and a sense of purpose.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The public health emergency of the last three years has taken a drastic toll on student achievement nationwide, with low-income scholars of color-who make up 97% of the scholar population at Alliance-disproportionately harmed by the pandemic's stolen opportunities to learn. Not only have trends demonstrated a steep decline in student growth and performance across all academic subjects, but Math in particular has reflected the largest declines across the United States where students already perform below average compared to students from other countries on the global stage. Math concepts are compounding, requiring students to master a number of prerequisite skills in order to perform on grade level. When significant gaps in early understanding and mastery are not addressed, it makes it especially difficult for students to build upon the important conceptual foundation often needed to be successful in the classroom and in the real world.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Given the urgency of this national crisis and the unique constraints now facing Alliance scholars in math-and in service of our mission to ensure all Alliance scholars graduate college-ready-over the next three years we seek to implement a network-wide, high-dosage math tutoring intervention strategy. This strategy is designed to bolster academic instruction and mitigate the damaging impact of the pandemic on near- and long-term scholar achievement. Continuing to strengthen general education math for all scholars and offering high dosage tutoring is one of the most promising ways to support and accelerate scholar learning. Tutoring ensures specific interventions are available to help scholars below grade level learn important math concepts, while safeguarding time for teachers to focus on providing grade-level instruction in the general education classroom. Towards this end, Alliance seeks funding to expand our partnership with Air Tutors-a virtual tutoring company that offers small group tutoring for scholars-allowing us to provide high-dosage math tutoring across the network. We have selected Air Tutors because of the company's demonstrated efficacy and impressive outcomes in serving students with similar demographic backgrounds and life experiences to Alliance scholars.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "To regularly assess scholars' academic progress across the network throughout the year, Alliance introduced the iReady diagnostic screener for the first time last year, helping our educators to pinpoint each scholars' strengths and areas for academic improvement through targeted interventions. The primary objective of implementing high-dosage math tutoring is to accelerate the skills of scholars who are 2 or 3+ years behind, so they can access core grade level mathematics. We aim to build the math confidence of our scholars and provide high-dosage tutoring to scholars in a way that minimizes the lift on school leaders and teachers. Ultimately, our goal is to support Alliance scholars to achieve growth toward math proficiency, as measured by their scores on the state standardized exam SBAC and a 6 percentage point gain average over the next three schools years, beginning with last year's 2021-22 school year performance as our baseline (Middle School math 17%, High School math 23%).",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In the short-term, addressing scholars' unfinished learning is a top priority for Alliance, particularly in math where scholars lost significant ground during the pandemic. Our partnership with Air Tutors will allow us to cultivate a safe and supportive space for positive learning experiences for Los Angeles' youth, close critical learning gaps, and accelerate scholars' academic success in math. Long term, our organizational northstar is that at least 75% of Alliance scholars successfully graduate from a four-year college. As Los Angeles grows increasingly diverse with economic inequality becoming more pronounced, youth are calling on us to change the underlying structural inequalities that have stopped us from living up to our highest ideals as a nation and threaten our collective well-being and global sustainability. Our shared well being is tied directly to the Alliance scholars' success and their ability to access the single most important lever for social change: a college degree.",

The sex trade preys on marginalized populations: homeless youth, foster youth, sexual minorities, and vulnerable women with histories of sexual abuse, domestic violence, homelessness, mental health conditions, substance use disorders, disabilities, and immigration status. Individuals in the sex trade industry are ongoing targets of physical and sexual violence, resulting in physical and psychological health problems, high morbidity outcomes, and disproportionately high mortality rates. Research indicates that the vast majority of those in the sex trade want to leave but lack the options, resources, and agency to safely and successfully exit.

Using a harm reduction approach and evidence-based interventions, our residential program aims to support and empower young survivors of sexual exploitation with coping and life skills needed to break intergenerational cycles of abuse and trauma. Residents attend onsite educational programming including GED tutoring sessions, technical certification programs, or higher education courses. Residents attend onsite individual therapy, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills groups, psycho-educational survivors groups, psycho-educational recovery groups, and therapeutic workshops including experiential therapy, trauma-informed yoga, ocean therapy, animal-assisted therapy, and creative arts therapy.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Homeless youth are disproportionately female, LGBTQ, BIPOC, and foster youth. Homelessness is one of the top risk factors for trafficking and sexual exploitation. Women of color are disproportionately incarcerated for prostitution charges. Through the provision of residential treatment for survivors, Resilience Rising helps to move vulnerable individuals away from the streets and jails into community-based services. Community-based interventions reduce harm in this population and reduce rates of recidivism in the targeted and associated behaviors. Our program empowers survivors at the micro level while simultaneously offering systemic change at the macro level through alternatives to homelessness and incarceration. In addition to our residential treatment program, Resilience Rising is in the process of opening a permanent supportive housing program for survivors to ensure that a lack of safe, stable housing is never a reason for entering the sex trade nor a barrier to leaving it.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Resilience Rising acknowledges that healing from trauma is a non-linear, life-long process and that relapse is a common part of the journey. Thus, we do not measure success through an all or nothing lens, particularly in regards to sobriety, intimate partner violence, and sexual exploitation. We often see survivors take two steps forward and one step back. That step backward simply presents another opportunity for pause, reflection, and problem solving moving forward. Resilience Rising employs the stages of change model to meet survivors where they are and utilizes a harm reduction approach to measure success. We assess program impact and outcome by measuring indicators related to self-concept and self-actualization, physical and behavioral health, safety, housing, education, employment, life skills, social support, and parenting skills.",

The 2022 LA County Youth Sports Participation Equity for the Play Equity Fund survey, reported a widened play equity gap that affects low-income youth and youth from communities of color - most of whom we serve. Results also reflected that LA County parents felt there were not enough opportunities for their children to play sports, especially from low-income households. To address, we provide access for youth to participate in sports focusing on low-income youth and youth of color. Through sports, our youth develop skills in leadership, teamwork, discipline, character, and critical thinking. We prioritize professional development focused on social-emotional competencies and positive youth development and offer a holistic approach offering programs in academics, healthy lifestyles, mental health support, life skills, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and more.",

We provide sports leagues at Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District (SMMUSD) elementary and middle schools, sports at our Club branches in Santa Monica and branch site located at the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) affordable housing complex, Mar Vista Gardens (MVG). At MVG, 100% of youth come from low-income families; most are Latinx (76%) and African American (18%). Many of our youth would not have the opportunities to participate in programs and sports that our Club provides. We serve about 1,300 youth annually in sports, including basketball, flag football, soccer, baseball, T-ball, track, and volleyball. Our sports leagues consist of four 8-week seasons/4 seasons per year with seven weeks of league play and a playoff/tournament in the eighth week. We provide access for all youth regardless of skill level, age, gender, or family income and eliminate sports participation barriers. We subsidize lower-income students to participate in school sports. All MVG youth are not charged a fee for sports participation and also participate in some SMMUSD leagues. We provide transportation for kids who need it. We utilize a positive youth development approach focusing on developing our staff on trauma-informed sports programming and promoting life-skills-building experiences and social-emotional competencies that help develop character, leadership, social-emotional skills, and healthy habits."

Despite the county's robust economy, many young people find themselves struggling to secure meaningful employment, particularly those from low-income or marginalized communities. Additionally, larger societal factors such as discrimination, immigration status and unequal access to resources have contributed to this issue. Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds often face significant barriers to accessing the resources and opportunities necessary for economic advancement, whether it's due to their race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or other factors.

The purpose of the StreetLeader program is to equip the teens in the Canoga Park neighborhood with the skills and character they need to enact the 'Cycle of Restoration' - eventually serving as the leaders who transform their own communities from the inside out. We are seeking to address the issues of educational inequality, youth unemployment and access to higher education for Black and Brown students. Teens are financially compensated for their leadership at the after school and summer camp programs offered year round by UrbanPromise Los Angeles. This unique approach to economic advancement allows teens to learn in a \"mistake making environment\" where they can implement their leadership skills and receive guidance for further growth. The StreetLeader program is hands-on job training and experiential learning which positions teens as empowered program leaders. \"Youth who are invested in are more invested,\" says Michelle Obama.

While families live in the units -approximately 4-month stays for each family - children go to school, parents go to work if employed, and families work with a case manager to access resources that provide longevity - mental health services for them and/or their children, continuing education/employment work that increases earning capacity, benefits enrollment and other personal administrative work that can often serve as barriers.

(LAHSA). Family homelessness is impactful on parents; consider the lack of stability, safety and inordinate accompanying traumas. When parents experiencing homelessness are asked \"what is most impactful about your situation?\" the answer is that their ability to provide for and protect their children is put into question. Children who experience family homelessness are 5x more likely to experience it as adults (Nat'l Alliance to End Homelessness). The experience of homelessness is traumatic for anyone, but for children, social/emotional development, academic progress, and ability to develop organic, healthy coping mechanisms are badly diminished. Addressing family homelessness is a crucial step in making L.A. an equitable, healthy place for families in 2050. It demonstrates an understanding of the problem now and prevents slides into poverty & homelessness in the future.",

In any format, L.A. County is made better because 29 families will not be on the street, their capacity to earn & sustain will be increased, mental health & medical needs will be met, and their children will be supported to thrive academically, developmentally, and socially. In the long term, it is successful if our community considers family supports and services as a meaningful upstream intervention to prevent chronic homelessness in the future.

The Northeast San Fernando Valley community suffers a lack of access to clean mobility options, close proximity to toxic facilities, and a need for diverse mobility options to access jobs. The COVID pandemic has magnified these inequities. Pacoima Beautiful led a transportation needs assessment in June 2020 that surveyed over 600 local residents, finding that most community members are dependent on public transport to access their jobs. It also identified a desire for more options for micro-mobility options in the community, as residents noticed the introduction of electric car and bike share programs that have been introduced in other parts of Los Angeles and used for recreation.

Thus far, the primary challenge we are seeing is the need for cohort members to swap out batteries for their bikes, as due to proprietary components on the bikes that do not allow for at-home battery charging. We will measure success based on the number of rentals, length of rentals, and type of activities the bicycles are used for. We will also track challenges with the program so that we can continue to build infrastructure and address potential roadblocks to its expansion. Periodically, Pacoima Beautiful organizes group rides and events to build the visibility of the program and provide a space for participants to build familiarity and comfort with riding their bikes in this community.

As the program grows, participation has been opened more broadly with an emphasis and priority for low-income members. Potential uses for the bikes include: -Long-term rental (6 to 12 months) for personal and professional use -E-Bikes (and especially E-Cargo Bikes) in workforce development programs -Youth programming activities -Bike and E-bike safety classes -Group rides for recreation and exploration of the community It is expected that participants will use the bikes for a range of purposes, from commuting to school or work, utilizing for delivery services, and completing daily errands. Initial participants check in with the project team regularly, and usage is tracked to inform program design. Bikes are stored at Pacoima Beautiful and are distributed at our facilities.

Discharged participants often spearhead their own recovery meetings to show others still suffering what worked for them. This is the true reach of the program; it grows exponentially over time and has limitless impact. Our long term vision for Los Angeles County is to see our self-sustaining recovery treatment fellowships spread throughout marginalized neighborhoods and communities. We also hope to consult with existing treatment centers to help implement our programs and ensure the racial inequities existing in their programs are addressed and demolished.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Substance abuse and mental health suffering consistently remain two of America's most pressing public health concerns, and racial inequities are glaring in treatments for both. Our programs address the inequalities in Recovery fellowships today. The majority of self-help fellowships offering treatment for these issues historically consist of white people, and a fundamental aspect of this type of treatment's success is people relating to one another through shared experiences. Our own team members and executives have first-hand experience of being rejected by these fellowships for sharing from the Black and LGBTQ+ perspectives, as their lived experiences coming from marginalized communities are significant factors leading to their substance abuse and mental health suffering. The solution is culturally specific treatment to break down the barriers of the mind and soul caused by mental health suffering, substance abuse, and systemic racism. Then, an individual's potential is limitless.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We will be measuring our program's impact in multiple ways. Firstly, we keep records of all of our outpatient participants and their progress throughout their program. One aspect of our outpatient programs are \"check-ins\" with those that have completed a program. These follow-ups help us measure each participant's success and how we can continue helping them if needed. Our participants eventually become \"alumni\" who help new participants through our fellowship meetings. Meaning, our participants who complete outpatient programs continue to remain a part of our recovery community which gives us perspective on our impact as our community grows. We will also keep records of all community members who seek any of our community services in order to ensure we are prioritizing the services most requested by our members. We will also keep track of all fellowship groups that stem from our participants which will provide perspective into the number of indirect people impacted by our program."

YWFC's current programs are part of a larger holistic leadership development model which supports BIPOC young women and trans youth of all genders as they develop self-determination-based leadership skills, build economic power, explore new ways of approaching their personal healing, and are in community with peer leaders able to support their continued growth. YMU specifically is designed to create youth-led, transformative systems that support the healthy well-being of system-impacted young mothers, particularly black girls and women, and women of color that are disproportionately harmed and neglected by the public health care system; and support their power and leadership to create transformative systems that ensure young mothers are able to advocate for their lives and the lives of their children. To do this, YMU will reach 60 mothers by survey, retain 10 core leaders throughout the program, and provide 10 participants with an additional $200 monthly stipend. Results from the surveys will be used to develop recommendations to inform the next budget for the Board of Supervisors, with the aim of ensuring that the voices and needs of systems-impacted young parents are reflected in Los Angeles' budgetary priorities.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We envision a Los Angeles in which young people are given the support, trust and resources they need to thrive, rather than being funneled into cycles of criminalization and incarceration and relying on the underground street economy to survive. Young Mother's United has changed not only the justice system but the medical advocacy space as well. YMU gave birth to the anti- shackle legislation that protected the rights of incarcerated birthing people. These were organized young mothers who wanted to create better experiences and outcomes within their communities. This legislation has not only changed countless families'; birth experiences in California but has also set a new legal precedent around the bodily autonomy of incarcerated people. This organizing framework further supports young mothers in LA county and develops a framework to meet their needs as they are raising the next generation of Angelenos.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our key marker of success with new participants is a baseline of stability and meeting basic needs towards an ability to engage in more comprehensive and transformative programming. Young Mothers United has an 80% completion rate andaims to support those who complete each program to meet a minimum of 70% of the goals they identify with their life coaches in their life self-determination plan. We measure success by 90% of those placed post-completion maintaining those positions at six months, 80% after a year, and 75% after eighteen months.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Young parents in the justice system have historically been stripped of their rights and often experience harmful levels of family separation. Young Mothers United (YMU) was born out of the need for a place for young mothers to meet and organize to work toward receiving dignified treatment as parents with the goal of addressing the harms caused by state involvement in our families. What makes YMU uniquen is the organizing capacity of the program: curriculum is designed to educate our participants on the systemic factors affecting their daily lives, and over the course of the program each cohort chooses an issue to explore as a legislative matter. It is possible for system impacted parents to be heard, validated, treated with dignity, and meaningfully involved in critical decision making about their children.",

The LA County Board of Supervisors' 2020 motion to replace the juvenile justice system by 2025 with a new trauma-informed, community-based, restorative justice treatment and rehabilitative services model has made it clear: LA's communities need more programs to support BIPOC youth diverted away from incarceration. Organizations that offer 1) holistic, trauma-informed mindfulness practices to help neglected and abused youth heal and see hope for their future, 2) possess a strong track record of previous success, and 3) enjoy deep relationships of trust with the juvenile justice system and systems-impacted families are essential to a successful transition away from the current punitive, ineffective juvenile justice model.",

To fill the gap, Founder/CEO Akuyoe Graham added after-release community-based programs, initially partnering with the grandmother of a formerly incarcerated youth to offer food & hospitality weekly in a South Central home. As demand grew, we relocated. From these humble roots, Mentoring Leaders has grown into a free after-school program offering an intergenerational community for healing, mentorship, & arts-focused support for youth. An international youth service trip to Ghana scheduled for summer 2024 will be a highlight. Key Components Creative arts Cultural enrichment opportunities Spiritual & professional counseling Peer-to-peer mentorship Tutoring Job preparation Financial aid/scholarships Meditation International service trips Mentoring Leaders went virtual during the Pandemic, minimizing staffing costs & making the program geographically accessible to more youth. But the face-to-face connection between teaching artists & youth that drives safety, risk-taking & innovation in the creative process was compromised. We will transition back to a hybrid format, & include nutritional meals. Teaching artists will run in-person bi-weekly sessions alternating with virtual sessions & pilot a future wellness center envisioned as a safe place for young creatives to take advantage of healing arts & mentorship opportunities.",

Migrating children have lost familiar routines and relationships, spending months in shelters without access to safe play and education opportunities. As 90% of brain development occurs before age 5, it is essential to support migrant children during this critical window. Nurturing educational programs and social support for families during and after immigration can offset the impact of trauma and prepare children and their parents to thrive in their new home.

For Nest LA, we will continue to obtain qualitative feedback around participants' needs and experiences. We will collect baseline demographic and socioeconomic data for deeper understanding of how these factors may impact participant experiences. We will track additional measurements from baseline to completion to 3 months post on key outcomes including parental skills, self-efficacy, self-compassion, parent-child interactions, and early childhood development milestones.

Murthy named social isolation and loneliness - defined as having few social relationships, social roles, and infrequent social interaction - as an \"urgent public health issue\" and asked for the American People's immediate action (Murthy, 2023, p. 6). Loneliness leads to poor health primarily because it triggers physiological stress responses which exacerbate illness (Cacioppo, 2018). Many factors contribute to an individual's social disconnection, and the unhoused often lie at the intersection of all of these factors. For example, someone who is unemployed, has a mental health illness, lacks familial support, is sleeping on the street, and is failing to meet societal norms is four times as likely to be isolated and therefore more likely to be experiencing poor health.",

We believe that by first connecting unhoused folks to stable and safe community, we are then more able to work on bigger goals like health care, housing and long-term mental health interventions that lead to continued success in staying healthy and housed. Recent studies cite that individuals must perceive that they have access to health care systems in order to utilize them, and that the factors that influence this perception include things such as \"approachability, availability, and affordability\" of health care services (Gordon, 2022, p.2). The Center uniquely provides just that - approachable, available, and free social connection groups and health care in one location, because facilitating a safe and supportive environment at the Day Center invariably increases enrollment in our On-Site Clinic given that the foundation of trust has already been laid. Our programming and On-Site Clinic address factors that inhibit health by providing accessible social groups, preventative health care, substance use supports, nutritious meal programs, medication management, linkage to housing interventions and more."

The impact of COVID-19 presented a plethora of issues for black students such as negative remote learning experiences, increased drop-out rates, and mental health issues. These issues resulted in many students being disadvantaged due to limited resources and difficult home environments. Unfortunately, 84% of black, low-income students didn't meet state math standards and 70% didn't meet language arts standards in 2022. The graduation rate also dropped to 60%. As the students who started high school amidst the pandemic enter their junior and senior years, their feedback speaks volumes - they are determined to bridge the gap in social and academic knowledge, desperate to compensate for the experiences they missed. It is imperative that we address this gap, ensuring these students gain the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in college and beyond.",

We use Net Promoter Score and Customer Satisfaction indicators to analyze teacher and administrator satisfaction with our program throughout the year. Student proficiency rates and motivational data are tracked via 9 Dots' Online Teaching Platform. Coding challenges in each lesson are tagged for difficulty and the coding and problem-solving skills required to complete them to calculate proficiency. Student motivational and inclusion data is captured through intermittent surveys that are embedded in our curriculum and include yes/no statements such as \"I am a coder,\" \"I like coding,\" and \"I feel like I belong in a coding class\".",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, CS occupations are growing faster than average across the labor market. Yet women and people of color remain widely underrepresented across CS fields. A key driver of these disparities is a lack of access to early, consistent, high-quality CS education in public schools. Most CS opportunities are reserved for high school students, occur in opt-in after-school spaces, or require access to expensive private tutoring. Opportunities for students as young as Kindergarten to learn CS during the standard school day and in a way that requires nothing from them or their parents/guardians are rare. A recent poll by Google & Gallup showed that underrepresented students who have the opportunity to learn CS early are more likely to enroll in CS courses offered in upper grades. By building full K-6 CS learning pathways at Title-I elementary schools, 9 Dots provides CS learning opportunities for underserved youth that otherwise would not have access.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "California's voluntary K-12 CS implementation plan emphasizes the importance of equitable CS access, but while some funding has been directed to the initiative, there's been little impact on our youngest students. Additionally, efforts to remedy pandemic learning loss have led to the deprioritization of subjects beyond math and ELA. This means that many low-income schools don't have what they need to offer CS. This is a particularly hard problem at the elementary school level where CS learning opportunities are rare and the foundational skills are developed - or where many underrepresented students begin to opt out. 9 Dots is bridging the gap between what schools can offer their students and what students need to thrive in the 21st century. 9 Dots plans to bring Get Coding to every Title-I elementary school in LA. When we do, hundreds of thousands of LA's youngest students will have access to the CS education they need to be prepared for and thrive in our ever-changing world.",

Nearly 30,000 children in Los Angeles County are currently receiving child welfare services on any given day, and over 15,500 are living in out-of-home placement. Kidsave staff understands that their histories of abuse and neglect can make it extremely difficult for older foster youth to take a chance on building a relationship with an adult who might disappoint them. Our staff takes the time to listen to these youth and help them prepare to take a chance. It takes only one adult in a child's life to make an impact - a chance to achieve their academic goals, have a supportive person to turn to in times of crisis, and provide a real opportunity to thrive and become successful adults.

We address the need for workforce training for systems-involved youth and opportunity youth, those outside of college and workforce participation. Primary reasons young people become involved with gangs, drugs and crime are lack of positive role models and support. Gangs provide a substitute for caring adults, addressing low self-esteem, the desire for a sense of belonging, and protection. Acceler8 counters these influences by providing positive role models and helping students build skills in an important trade field. We change the trajectory of these young people's lives by helping them learn valuable skills as well as respect, integrity, self-discipline and responsibility. They benefit greatly when given the opportunity to learn a trade that can support them and their families without requiring a college degree.",

The probation department has shared direct reflections from our youth to help us measure the impact of our program. 80% of our youth reported that they have a better understanding of why voting and civic engagement is important. We've gauged the impact of our VR program through testimonials from participants serving life sentences as well reports from in-prison mental health supervisors. This has led to a new contract within CDCR to implement this program more frequently in adult prisons. Currently, a member of our staff and 4 members of our Alumni Lab who participated while they were incarcerated are now successful reentered citizens, employed as subject matter experts and teaching artists with us.",

Nationally, Black people are incarcerated 5x the rate of white people. These racial disparities are also prominent in youth, nationally, an average of 80% of incarcerated youth are Black. In 2014, almost 50,000 CA youth spent time in juvenile court school, 85% of them are youth of color. These statistics reinforce a lack of equity in resources for youth and little access to creative outlets. This empowers us to do the work to initiate reform using the arts and VR technology as tools to combat inequities and reduce recidivism. As we observe how technology is fast overtaking daily life, it is clear that adapting STEAM programs and practices, that is technology with the inclusion of arts, will support our incarcerated and justice-impacted partners.

This program is rooted in civic engagement. As we are on the heels of an election year, we will be able to further support youth in understanding current policies, people, and legislation; as well as the importance of their vote. Doing this with an artistic approach will redefine how LA County youth engage with civics. Finally, the success of this program will be reflected by the circular impact of our organization.

Exercises of Theater, poetry, visual arts and music teach methods of self exploration, emotional capacity and social engagement. We've already had a huge impact with a 100% participant voting rate, and want to deepen that with the addition of VR. After the reentry, mental health and overall skill building success of our VR ReEntry program that is deployed in CA prisons, we want to include VR technology within the Art Attacks! program to support our youth. It is clear that STEAM education is the future for our youth, being able to gamify lessons on history and civics while introducing them to technology that supports core skills will expand our impact. The addition of VR will support STEAM learning for youth across LA County and allow youth to have immersive experiences as they engage with the history of justice in our country. This will include forms of engagement such as being part of a protest, visiting a voting center, even interacting with their peers in public spaces. With this addition, we will be able to support youth's experience of being released. Through these VR exercises, we hope to equip youth with tools to have agency over their freedom, move confidently through society and as experience has shown, reduce the rate of recidivism.",

Young people deserve access to resources that help meet their physical, mental, emotional, and financial needs and have spaces where they feel safe. Ultimately, AHJN hopes to change LA County by co-empowering youth to transform the juvenile justice system.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "AHJN uses a spreadsheet-based database system to record attendance, participation, survey results, and other impact data. Additionally, a retrospective survey is administered during programming to capture a snapshot of the youth's experience in the program. This strengths-based survey (co-developed with AHJN youth) explores youths' sense of social connection, access to resources, and sense of mastery (of skills, or overcoming a previous hurdle). AHJN teaching artists also have check ins with students to ensure they are on track to complete assignments and assess any barriers to completing work. We also conduct youth listening sessions throughout the year to ensure feedback from our constituency. We assess how effective programming was for each student and identify how we can adjust future programming to be more effective. Evaluation of YLD programs have shown increases in self-confidence, perceived leadership, and creative abilities, as well as trust in key life figures.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "AHJN serves young people who have faced enormous challenges. Justice-involved and at-promise youth represent some of the most underserved and marginalized populations comprised of multiple intersecting identities - including diverse racial and ethnic identity, gender identity, and sexual orientation, among many others. Boys and girls of color are vastly overrepresented within Los Angeles County's juvenile justice system. The factors that contribute to justice involvement can create compounding inequity and barriers throughout a youth's life: trauma, community violence, gang involvement, and poverty. We also serve those who have not had direct juvenile justice system involvement but might have experienced harm by other systems such as the foster care system and the education system. YLD addresses these issues by using healing-centered arts and a strengths-based approach to give youth a way to process these experiences and use them to heal.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "YLD features evidence-based programming including responsive healing-informed arts education, Creative/Positive Youth Development, Social Emotional Learning, Trauma-Informed Care, and mentorship. Through YLD, we will help young people reclaim their lived experience and grow into advocates and leaders, through three program components: the Our True Colors (OTC) peer support group, a Youth Resiliency & Movement Building Fellowship track focused on youth-led advocacy, and an Art Fellowship track where youth become paid interns with an AHJN member. OTC sessions, held virtually once per week after school throughout the year, consist of healing-informed arts education utilizing a variety of media, plus community and relationship building with and between young people. OTC serves as a \"landing pad\" for youth where they are connected with other resources to help meet their basic needs. OTC includes peer mentorship, whereby youth who have already participated in the program mentor new students. Youth who participate in OTC may also continue in one of YLD's other two tracks. In Art Fellowships, we match youth with network member organizations for a paid, 200-hour workforce development fellowship. In our Youth Resiliency & Movement Building Fellowship, youth build leadership skills by giving public comment at policy meetings, training members on the County's advocacy landscape, and sitting on committees. Over the course of the next year, we anticipate serving 45 youth through YLD.",

The intended impact of our project, the Masket Foundation Initiative, extends beyond immediate care provision, encompassing long-term scaling and expansion to create lasting change. However, our vision for success extends far beyond immediate outcomes. We aspire to establish a sustainable model of eye care delivery that can serve as a blueprint for other communities facing similar challenges. With successful implementation, we plan to scale and expand our initiatives, eventually establishing additional free clinics strategically located throughout Los Angeles County. These clinics will serve as community hubs, providing accessible and comprehensive eye care services, awareness programs, and educational resources.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The grant will play a crucial role in supporting our impactful project, the Masket Foundation Eye Care Access Initiative, designed to address the pervasive issue of limited access to quality eye care in Los Angeles County. With the grant's assistance, we will establish and operate a dedicated free clinic that serves as a comprehensive hub for a wide range of eye care services. This initiative will encompass crucial components such as diagnosis and treatment of various eye conditions and surgical intervention. We are different than other nonprofits because most do not provide the surgical intervention needed but that is our main focus. Through the Eye Care Access Initiative, we aim to reach and serve the most vulnerable and underserved populations, including the medically indigent and those with lower income insurance, who often face significant financial and logistical barriers in obtaining the eye care they urgently need. By removing the financial burden entirely, we will ensure that individuals in need receive the same high-quality eye care that is typically available only to those with more privileged resources.

Quantitatively, we'll track metrics like individuals served, access to play spaces, and mental health service utilization. Pre- and post-assessments will measure changes in mental health outcomes, including well-being and reduced disparities. This evidence will demonstrate our project's effectiveness in addressing play equity and promoting mental health. It'll guide decision-making, program adjustments, and potential scaling in the future.",

Our strategies involve increasing the representation and training of Black mental health providers and play therapists. We recruit and support individuals from Black communities interested in mental health careers, offering scholarships, mentorship programs, and culturally competent training to enhance the availability of inclusive services. We establish community centers as accessible and inclusive healing spaces, offering expressive arts activities and ensuring access to green spaces for outdoor engagement. Community engagement includes awareness campaigns, collaboration with influential figures, and culturally sensitive workshops. We strengthen education and career pathways through mentorship programs, scholarships, and diverse curricula. Success is measured by increased representation, utilization of healing spaces, community engagement, and reported improvements in mental health. We aim to create a supportive environment, foster resilience, and promote a healthier, more equitable future.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We aim to address the lack of play equity and its impact on mental health and access to inclusive services for underserved communities. Play inequity disproportionately affects under-resourced areas, limiting recreation and well-being. Consequences include increased stress, isolation, and higher rates of anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues. Limited providers, stigma, and systemic barriers hinder access to inclusive mental health services. Urgently addressing this issue mitigates negative impacts, empowers individuals, and promotes well-being. Disparities exist, with underserved areas lacking parks and facing higher mental health challenges. Our focus on play equity enhances well-being and resilience in underserved communities.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "For centuries, Black Bodies, and the souls that inhabit them, have been devalued and dehumanized. Unfortunately, anti-Black racism in this country is alive and thriving as evidenced by the school-to-prison pipeline, disproportionate expulsion rates, low college application/acceptance and over incarceration. Los Angeles county Blacks are incarcerated 13x more often than whites. Even though Blacks only make up less than 10% of the county population, they represent 24% of law enforcement killings. The 2020 assassination of Mr George Floyd projected the egregious reality of the US on the world stage: the ramifications of this country's oppressive historical truths - genocide, slavery, Jim Crow, lynching, police brutality of epidemic proportions (and a society-wide addiction to watching violence against Black bodies) - still live on.

Cultural shifts are nearly imperceptible as they are happening, but we can capture qualitative information (i.e. healing, self-esteem, belongingness) from participants. Past program participants, for example, have reported: \"getting more out of the program than ALL of my therapy sessions put together.\" \"I found value in places I wasn't looking for nor even knew existed.\" \"I am able to embrace my power as a Black person\" \"We cannot look away from the atrocities committed against Black bodies. This program helped me reckon with and heal this history.\" Working with men in the Los Angeles area will impact the way they see themselves, change the way others see them, ultimately making the world safer for black bodied people.",

We provide 12-weeks of programming that explores the history of precolonial Africa as a way to reclaim ancestral wisdom to be applied in their contemporary lives. We introduce the participants to the wisdom in the myths and stories related to the various deities from across Africa. The program culminates in a photoshoot to document the participants as they connect to their heritage, embody the ancient wisdom and live into the god-like qualities explored in the sessions. The photoshoot is a full-scale experience and includes wardrobe consultations, hair and make up and professional photography. The images from the photoshoot will be used to create the third installment of the successful Black Goddess Within Oracle Deck series. I've chosen oracle decks as a medium because nearly all human communication is nonverbal. Symbols, signs, and images carry much of our cultural and social information. Through repeated use, this information becomes embedded in our subconscious. The images in the Black God/desses decks assert and normalize our humanity.",

The project is, however, a power contribution to the reversal of anti-Black racism and we know this work is restorative and changes lives. Our vision for project success will be determined by several factors: Do the participants report emotional safety over the course of the program? Are they able to open up and share vulnerably? Can they apply the wisdom from the deities of Africa to their lived experience in Los Angeles? When the participants have these experiences, we affirm that there will be shifts in other parts of their lives as well. Secondly, we now have a relationship with Hay House, the largest international publisher of self help and spiritual books and decks. Our second deck is currently available for pre order and launching on December 12! We would love to see the Black God Deck distributed through Hay House as well. We would love to see this deck in the hands of at least 15,000 people.",

We believe that by first connecting unhoused folks to stable and safe community, we are then more able to work on bigger goals like health care, housing and long-term mental health interventions that lead to continued success in staying healthy and housed. Recent studies cite that individuals must perceive that they have access to health care systems in order to utilize them, and that the factors that influence this perception include things such as \"approachability, availability, and affordability\" of health care services (Gordon, 2022, p.2). The Center uniquely provides just that - approachable, available, and free social connection groups and health care in one location, because facilitating a safe and supportive environment at the Day Center invariably increases enrollment in our On-Site Clinic given that the foundation of trust has already been laid.

Murthy named social isolation and loneliness - defined as having few social relationships, social roles, and infrequent social interaction - as an \"urgent public health issue\" and asked for the American People's immediate action (Murthy, 2023, p. 6). Loneliness leads to poor health primarily because it triggers physiological stress responses which exacerbate illness (Cacioppo, 2018). Many factors contribute to an individual's social disconnection, and the unhoused often lie at the intersection of all of these factors. For example, someone who is unemployed, has a mental health illness, lacks familial support, is sleeping on the street, and is failing to meet societal norms is four times as likely to be isolated and therefore more likely to be experiencing poor health.",

In the long-term, The Center aims to meet this goal by scaling-up our unique social connection-based Day Center and Wellness programming model so that the healthcare and housing success that our clients enjoy can be experienced exponentially throughout Los Angeles. In the short-term, The Center plans to connect 1,000 unhoused participants to community health supports, and to perform comprehensive Day Center program evaluation, to ensure that we are doing everything we can to improve the overall quality of life for people experiencing homelessness.",

Our objective is to increase the total number of families served by CalWORKS HVP by 20% over 3 years, resulting in an additional 320 LA County families and between 1,200 and 2,000 statewide. We will continue our work with LA County community colleges, training over 300 personnel a year on Title XI protections for pregnant, parenting, and lactating students with low incomes. These trainings have identified that most community colleges have not implemented Title IX policies to protect pregnant, parenting, and lactating students from discrimination, nor have colleges developed policies and procedures to provide accommodations to pregnant, parenting and lactating students. As a result, Western Center will be working to add an exemption and/or good cause for pregnant, parenting, and lactating CalWORKs participants who have to drop a class or do not make satisfactory progress in a college class because of discrimination and/or a lack of accommodations. We will expand our outreach to community college students on the increased financial incentive to now participation in CalWORKs HVP, encouraging students with low incomes to access the full range of resources available to their families.",

Enrollment in the program is at a historic low due to archaic, racist rules and workforce requirements that make continued participation challenging. We are working to transform this structure at the State level with AB310, and at the local level, we are working to increase enrollment by educating college students, 20% of who are parents, as well as Title XI administrators on the protections available for CalWORKs participants to support their continued education and ultimately, financial success. We measure our impact by the number of Black families enrolling in CalWorks HVP and the system changes secured by our advocacy - ex. in June 2022, we secured the largest (21%) increase in CalWORKs' cash assistance grants and in July 2022, we secured an CalWORKs HVP enrollment incentive increase from $500 to $1,000."

Designed in alignment with CA Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards linked to STEM education:- Teacher Orientation: Receive and learn how to deliver program materials- Classroom Lesson: The History of the LA River- River Rover: Students compare states of the River and study: biodiversity & the riparian ecosystem, human impact on our ecosystem, Interconnected relationships, a 3D interactive River watershed, water conservation & management, a future of the River at a design table, the connection between the environment and public health- Classroom Lesson: Biodiversity: The Interconnectedness Between Living and Nonliving Things- LA River Field Trip: 3 interactive stations: Nature Walk: look for birds, observe their surroundings, and reflect on how nature impacts our health w/binoculars and field guides, Macroinvertebrate Water Quality Lab: Collect water samples of indicator species and implement the scientific process to determine ecosystem health, Engineering a Water Filtration System: After learning about stormwater and pollution, they collaboratively create 3D prototypes of a filtration system and present to the class",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We envision equitably-increased access to natural spaces and generations of students transforming the 51-mile River into a dynamic, functioning ecosystem that reduces flood risk, cleans the air, cools temperatures, and supports the biodiversity essential to our collective wellbeing. We see this every day in the people discovering that the river is a place of refuge creating park-rich neighborhoods, in our children who excitedly share what they've learned on their river field trips with their parents, and in our Fellows: immersed in river ecology, building a brighter future for our county. Source to Sea could expand beyond our record-breaking 5,500 students in a school year and be actively present in every region in the county. As teachers say, \"The lessons and activities really tie-in to science, engineering and social studies standards...it also reminded students that they can make a difference.\""

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Rowing is highly disciplined, both physically and mentally. The benefits are life-changing: confidence, tenacity, camaraderie, exposure to nature, and physical fitness. Rowers speak about the feeling of serenity, awareness, and accomplishment from being on the water working in synchronicity with the members of your boat. However, there is a glaring equity gap in the sport, and RowLA is seeking to address it with equal access to regatta competition, which is critical to advancement. Regatta participation is cost prohibitive but critical to rowers' progress. In addition to the competition, regattas provide opportunities for high school rowers to be seen by college coaches, compete against the best peer rowers, and visit area colleges they might be considering. Regattas are where rowers get better, get seen, and get recruited. Rowers who cannot afford to attend regattas are severely disadvantaged.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "RowLA's goal is to broaden the scope of our rowers' experience by providing equal access to competitive waterways, wherever they are. We do that by making regatta participation free for our team. As scholarship athletes, about half of them would not be able to attend regattas if they were required to pay. Regatta participation is critical. The more experience a racer has, the more capable they are in competition environments, and the greater chance they have of succeeding. Each year we make strategic choices around what races our girls can attend. Too often, our decision-making is influenced by our lack of funding for travel. It's important for us to compete at Boston's Head of the Charles Regatta (HOCR), which is the largest 3-day regatta in the world and the oldest in the United States. In addition to the competition experience, rowers there can be seen by college coaches from almost all 50 states and be inspired by racers from around the world. We would like to provide our team with an opportunity to attend regattas like HOCR, as well as several regional and national competitions. Last year, it cost our club more than $100,000 to participate in regattas. Moreover, our regatta schedule is constantly put in jeopardy because of important, pressing needs like repairing equipment, and increasing scholarship funding. A dedicated regatta fund would allow our athletes to have a robust 2023-2024 competition season; and could be used to elicit additional fundraising.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "RowLA was established in 2009, when founder Liz Greenberger noticed that entire swaths of Los Angeles' population were not represented at the rowing clubs of Marina del Rey, the only body of water available to rowers in the city. The diversity RowLA brings to this important waterway is evident, and is impacting the marina. Girls who may not have previously thought of themselves as rowers are inspired by our student-athletes. Our long waiting list is evidence of that, and we are working hard to raise additional funds that will allow us to enroll all the girls our student-athletes inspire. This is transformative for Los Angeles. The long-term impact is also incredibly important. Many colleges offer rowing scholarships. The traditional high school rower is wealthy, white, and not likely to need a scholarship. We give girls from under-represented communities the training they need to compete for those scholarships. Participation in competitive regattas is critical to their preparation.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "A salient measure of success is that 99% of RowLA graduates have gone to college. They were empowered by a rowing experience that transferred to their academic and civic life. RowLA ensures our athletes' transition with one-on-one college counseling focused on helping them get into college with the necessary funding, regardless of their desire to continue rowing. Consistently, about half of our rowers (currently 46%) come from low-wage or single-parent households, and face economic challenges, including food and housing insecurity. Many alumni who faced these obstacles would not have gone to college without the focus, encouragement, and tangible help RowLA provided. Additionally, RowLA gives girls with vastly different lived experiences, who may otherwise have never met, much less formed deep friendships, a chance to work together toward a shared goal. Talented, educated students from across the city are forming alliances that will greatly benefit Los Angeles' future."

As theatremakers and Angelenos ourselves, we have experienced and witnessed some of the most harmful treatment at the hands of institutions who run unopposed or without accountability mechanisms to ensure these behaviors never happen again. Within the past year, influential theatremakers such as Dominique Morriseau and Jeremy O'Harris, have pulled their works, citing discrimination and unresolved abuse at the hands of institutional leaders. If these acts happen to the most revered, who is to advocate for those not yet renowned? We look to serve the underserved, micro-aggressed, and mistreated by equipping them with the tools to make informed decisions on where to spend/exercise their artistic agency. Not having a safe workspace is mentally and emotionally detrimental.",

BLKLST co-created and campaigned for the LA Anti-Racist Theatre Standards (LA ARTS) that saw a minimum of 65 companies/organizations commit, including Center Theatre Group, Pasadena Playhouse, Hollywood Fringe Festival, and A Noise Within. Out of those who committed to the standards we had significant involvement in our bi-annual check-in which illustrates our significant role in providing timely information to our larger community. Most recently through our burgeoning Preventative Care initiative, we were able to keep artists safe by contacting Theatricum Botanicum after a concerned member of that institution reached out to us for help. We were able to guide the creative team to Cultural Competency Officers, as well as advocate for a dramaturg whose lens closely aligned with the story's vision to maintain artistic integrity and safety.

Another goal is to expand our involvement with theatres by ensuring a timely and accurate bi-annual check-in by guiding when needed and engaging with institutional leaders on their anti-racist endeavors. With our burgeoning Preventative Care methods, to help prevent further harm by bringing our unique lens to issues that might arrive between a theatre and theatremakers. This would take form of Restorative Justice sessions or conversations that address the issue at hand and create actionable steps to move forward safely and justly. Our goal is to ensure that we are a staple in the larger Los Angeles theatre and beyond by solidifying ourselves as advocates and trustworthy mechanism of community oversight and accountability. Ultimately, it's our hope that theatremakers feel safe.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Just as the The Negro Motorist Green Book looked to guide POC to safety, so too does BLKLST endeavor to lessen the harm enacted to BIPOC creatives. We have created a mechanism of accountability called the BLKLST. Using qualitative, and quantitative data, we showcase measures made by theatre nonprofits to ensure they are adhering to the Los Angeles Anti-Racist Theatre Standards (which we have co-authored) they have committed to upholding. Data justice being our main act of care, we would use funds to source, mine, and maintain all the data we would need to maintain the platform.

Our longstanding Day of Discovery program with LAUSD Beyond the Bell has warmed up schoolchildren to nature, making them less afraid and more willing to participate in the 5th grade camp-outs. Long-term studies suggest this is yielding nature-connected, environmentally-minded adults. The family programming provided by the Garden has been cultivating nature-connected families that return to the Garden on average 4 times per year, some as many as 300 days per year! Short-term CFG success will be measured in visitorship. We anticipate 100,000 additional guests per year (450,000 total garden guests annually) that will continue to reflect the diverse make-up of Los Angeles.

Post visit surveys and analysis will further measure success.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "People have disproportionate access to nature in LA. Greenspace, parks and trees are not readily available to everyone, as showcased in a National Geographic article from July 2021, which showed how lower-income areas of LA have increased hardscape and fewer trees then affluent neighborhoods. While one might be able to travel to green spaces outside of their neighborhoods, there are other barriers too. Physical barriers include ADA access and safety. Emotional barriers include feeling unwelcome due to ethnicity or socioeconomic status, fear of the outdoors, and lack of interest. Economic barriers can also be a challenge. This is a crisis of human wellbeing and a crisis for the environment. Playtime in nature lowers one's blood pressure, increases overall health and improves mood. People who spend time in nature are more likely to advocate for the health of our planet. We need to find creative ways to connect Los Angeles to our natural world.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "To connect all to the wonders of nature, SCBG will build the Children and Family Garden (CFG). CFG will provide children with a gentle invitation into nature, with welcoming experiences that serve as a first-step in raising nature-connected grown-ups. The kids that play here will take home deeply positive emotional souvenirs. They will be more likely to seek out other nature activities (such as hiking, birdwatching, camping and mountain biking) as they grow. 3.5 acres of whimsical plant-focused displays will WOW visitors. Oversized hummingbird sculptures teaming with living flowers will greet guests as they enter through a lush habitat with adventurous offshoots featuring climbing nets to encourage everyone to get a closer look at the botanicals. A canopy walk will reach high into the trees, with a bouncing suspension bridge and giant nests for critter spotting. A waterfall will encourage water play on hot days while a fossil dig will tell the story of the unique soil conditions of Palos Verdes. A great plant maze will invite games of hide-and-seek. SCBG is particularly suited to reduce the barriers to nature for Los Angeles, as we are a space that is proud of our \"trashy past.\" Founded atop of a garbage landfill, SCBG does not have the underlying stuffiness found at other attractions. Ours is a story of recovery, reclamation and regeneration. SCBG is committed to access, with a universally accessible CFG design, and DEI initiatives embedded in our strategic priorities.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "By 2050, one million of the children that visited CFG will be nature-connected adults. They will have all of the positive health benefits that nature provides - as they enjoy hiking, biking, birdwatching and camping as part of their lives. These people will make policy changes to ensure greenspace is available in all neighborhoods; they will make sustainable choices in their own lives and in business; they will raise nature-connected children. Short-term impacts include increased access to nature for LA. We anticipate 100,000 additional annual visitors, many of which will enjoy their first toe-dip into nature while on school field trips. The warm and fun atmosphere of CFG will disarm preconceived fears of nature (bugs, snakes, getting dirty). Little visitors will be excited to explore the Bloom and Sprout Garden, where they will learn where their food comes from. Children will dig with delight in the Marine Fossil Dig, which highlights the local soil conditions.",

SkaterTots is designed to address these issues by providing a systematic approach for girls ages 9-12 who score low on the Rosenberg self-esteem scale. The program utilizes roller skating as the primary activity, as physical activity in a group setting has been shown to positively impact mental wellness in children and adolescents (Yoon et al., 2019; Gordon et al., 2022).

In the first week, participants are fitted with roller skates, protective gear, and a helmet for safety. During the second week, they receive the equipment and keep it after graduation in the eighth week to continue their roller-skating journey. The skating component of the program is led by experienced roller skating instructors who encourage girls to take risks and teach them how to fall and get back up. Through this process, girls learn the importance of perseverance and resilience, two key traits for building self-esteem. In addition to skating instruction, SkaterTots incorporates various self-esteem-building activities designed to help girls recognize their unique strengths and qualities and develop a positive self-image. The program uses a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) exercises and play therapy to promote positive self-esteem. Participants engage in planned activities like reframing negative thoughts and setting intentions for self-care. The program is replicable and can be easily expanded to other Boys and Girls Club chapters. SkaterTots differs from other roller-skating programs in that it incorporates mental health awareness and self-esteem-building activities in an engaging way for youth along their skating journey.",

Growth in confidence will transcend beyond the skating rink and positively impact various aspects of their lives, such as academics, relationships, and personal growth. SkaterTots is now introducing a mentorship program wherein past graduates can volunteer in upcoming seasons, gaining volunteer credits and experience. To ensure SkaterTots sustainability and long-term impact, we plan to expand across Los Angeles County.

Further research indicates the unique ability of all-girls settings to identify how girls learn and succeed and, as a result, provide \"a certain comfort level that helps them develop greater self-confidence and broader interests, especially as they approach adolescence.\" Through an active pedagogy, GALS focuses on the health and wellness and daily movement needs of our students. Starting each school day with Morning Movement prepares our students (and staff) for the school day, improving alertness, attention, memory, and cognition, not to mention social interaction, community interconnectedness, self-esteem, and (of course) physical health. Students are exposed to a variety of fitness modalities and sports throughout the school year, giving them access to and experience in a diversity of sports and workout styles. GALS serves a population of 11-14 year-old girls who are 82% low income, 22% English Language Learners, and 13% Special Education in Panorama City.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If it were not challenging enough to be a teenage girl, being a BIPOC girl also comes with unique struggles when it comes to their mental health. From racism, discrimination, cultural insensitivity, internalized stigma, inadequate access to economic resources, and social exclusion, these add disproportionate stress and trauma to the mental health concerns girls are already facing. Beyond the joy, energy, and confidence our students gain from movement, research demonstrates that daily exercise improves memory, attention, and cognition. Sports participation also boosts self-esteem and civic engagement. Movement prepares our students to live long, fulfilled lives. As youth develop these qualities for themselves, they carry them forward into the world around them. As such, LA benefits directly from the resilient, healthy women these girls become by gaining a thriving member of the community. When one succeeds, we all succeed.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that nearly one in three high school girls considered suicide in 2021, a 60% increase since 2011. Although it is tempting to blame this on the pandemic, mental health issues among teens have been on the rise since at least 2012. Teen depression doubled between 2010 and 2019, well before the COVID-19 lockdowns and distance learning. Social media also plays a role. In 2022, 90% of girls report using social media every day and greatly reduced their in-person interactions with friends. This presents a significant challenge as social media is not only considerably less fulfilling than seeing friends in person, but comes with numerous risks including sexual exploitation, body image issues, and cyberbullying, all of which girls experience more than boys. It is not surprising that this dynamic has been proven to lead to behaviors linked to depression, including self-harm, suicide attempts, and deaths by suicide.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "GALS uses the various tools to measure progress towards its goals and objectives, including: Individual Student Academic and Wellness Action Plans (Quarterly): Allow students and parents the ability to track their own ongoing assessments and growth over time, reflect their own challenges, and collaboratively identify focus areas with their teachers and wellness coaches. Student surveys (Twice a year): These surveys allow us to measure more subjective items such as school culture, happiness, self-confidence and school environment. Parent surveys (Annually): These surveys allow us to measure parent satisfaction with the overall GALS program. Consistently, students report increases in physical, mental, and emotional health year after year. In addition, students demonstrate academic excellence. Compared to six local middle schools, GALS students averaged a score of 50% met or exceed on ELA (v. 29%) and 25% met or exceed on Math (v. 12%)."

By contrast, 74.4% of Angelenos without disabilities have jobs. The majority of creative industry internships require that applicants possess at least 1 year of relevant work experience to qualify, creating a significant barrier for job seekers with disabilities who struggle with securing an internship due to a lack of prior relevant work experience. Industry internships have become the entry-level job and are no longer for people just entering the workforce. Applicants who don't have prior relevant work experience simply don't qualify. Additionally, employers are less likely to hire an applicant with a disability due to societal stereotypes/stigmas. Securing the first internship is even more difficult for job seekers with disabilities, as employers are less likely to hire an applicant with a disability due to stereotypes/stigmas and are much more likely to hire those who've had internships before",

A pillar of our work is a robust and holistic College & Career Success Program including intensive mentorship, individualized academic and college access support, career readiness, and meaningful direct aid that represent a long-term investment in every individual student's success. CCS is a model program that can be applied in organizations across LA County, building pathways to careers and solving for income inequality that creates a ripple effect that can uplift whole communities.",
    "goal": "CREATE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Lack of access to equitable educational resources is a clear and systemic driver of income inequality, one that perpetuates itself. Differences in educational attainment among groups based on race and socioeconomic status-the opportunity gap-is an unfortunate hallmark of education in the U.S., and Los Angeles is no exception. LA's opportunity gap is concentrated in communities of low-income, BIPOC youth like those Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA) serves. With this in mind, HOLA exists to eliminate barriers to education, focusing on getting kids to and through post-secondary opportunities. Nearly all HOLA students are first generation college students, or even the very first in their families to attend. Time and again, studies have shown that access to higher education is key to increasing income potential and breaking generational cycles of poverty. Research also shows that for first generation students, lack of financial aid remains one of the largest barriers to high education attainment.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We know that individual student success doesn't only change one life, but has a ripple effect across whole communities. Within HOLA's walls, first generation college students attain degrees, become architects, lawyers, teachers, policy makers, and come back to bring new youth through our doors, mentor the next generation, and support HOLA's strategic growth so we can deliver our robust services across LA County. HOLA recently grew to serve 1,000 new youth across South Central and Watts, and our vision is to scale CCS to impact each of these students in the coming years. HOLA has developed an intensive college access and career readiness curriculum that can serve as a model program to be replicated across all underserved LA communities. Through this work, all youth can acquire the tools to achieve their visions of success including fulfilling, lucrative jobs and decreasing income inequality for themselves and their families.",

This year, 100% of high school students graduated and all but one (who elected to serve in the US Armed Forces) of HOLA's graduating seniors will be attending postsecondary institutions next year, an accomplishment made extra meaningful given the challenges Los Angeles youth faced during the Covid-19 crisis. HOLA has awarded more than $6.7 million in higher education scholarships to HOLA youth including nearly $1.2 million this year, direct aid that we know is critical to students' ability to matriculate through college. In addition, as HOLA continues to build out more and more robust career readiness resources, last year, 100% of high school students participated in career pathways programming and are making progress towards their academic and career goals.",

Through year-long one-on-one mentorship, individualized academic intervention, college visits, career readiness conferences, financial literacy, and more, CCS empowers students to graduate from high school, enter college or another postsecondary pathway, obtain a degree, and build a degree-aligned career in a broad spectrum of fields. Moreover, CCS provides gap-filling, multi-year direct scholarship aid that allows students to select colleges based on fit rather than price tag, and helps ensure they are able to stay in school year over year. This year, our work will take another leap forward with the launch of HOLA's Heart of a Mentor Program, a networking platform and program that will connect alumni to established professionals from our extended network of supporters and donors. HOLA's long-term investment in each student means supporting educational success and building pathways to careers that promote upward economic mobility and change the course of young Angelenos' lives.

In the meantime, we resolve each night to prevent as many people as possible from going to bed on an empty stomach. Time and again we hear from people we serve that our burritos are the only meal they might have had that day, especially in the encampments we serve that are isolated from outreach efforts and institutional outreach efforts and support. Folks living on the street cannot easily access services for a number of reasons: lugging their precious belongings is not easy, leaving them behind is risky. Navigating public transportation, limited physical mobility, mental health, language, literacy, and other disabilities all prevent those in need from accessing public assistance. That is why meeting people 'where they are' as the Share A Meal program does, is crucial.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Through its mobile kitchens (food trucks & support vans) the Share A Meal program has been meeting the needs of our unhoused community 'where they are' for 13 years. By meeting this vulnerable population on the streets where they struggle for basic needs we are not only easing that struggle, but just as importantly we are building trusting relationships. Each night volunteers pack 150-200 fresh burritos, bottled water, and humanitarian aid supplies and walk established service routes across Los Angeles. We serve hot meals with our own hands with dignity and respect. Share A Meal serves any community member who might experience food insecurity on any given night, although we primarily serve people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Our burritos are accessible for a variety of dietary restrictions and can be mass produced on short notice. Our volunteer base is composed of community members of all ages and backgrounds. They serve alongside university student volunteers from Share A Meal Campus clubs at USC, UCLA and LMU. This student/community member collaboration serves the program well. Over the course of the pandemic the number of people we meet along our outreach routes continues to grow and we are trying to grow our capacity to meet this increased need. This grant will help fund grocery, pantry, food service supplies, service vehicle expenses and other expenses involved in maintaining all the regulatory requirements for providing public meal service.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Each year we see the success of the Share A Meal program from four perspectives. First, the increasing demand from the unsheltered population for our meal and humanitarian aid service year after year. Second is the trust-building relationship between our program volunteers and the individuals we serve. As one burrito recipient commented: \"You don't just serve us meals, you also restore our faith and trust in humanity.\" Third, the trust we have built with this marginalized community becomes a bridge between this community and the many government agencies and community service providers there to serve them. Without a trusted \"friend\" to give direction, one unsuccessful try by a homeless person to gain access to services or benefits can discourage all future attempts as futile. Last, volunteering with Share A Meal raises one's consciousness around homelessness. Our volunteer experience plants a seed of service with students and a successful model to expand to more universities thrives.",

We meet and form relationships with thousands of people across the year and City, and our consistent presence signals not only a warm meal weekly for many people, but also reassurance that society still values our unhoused and food challenged neighbors. We hold ourselves accountable to our mission through capturing and analyzing the following metrics for success: meals served (nightly counts), volunteers engaged (nightly counts), and relationships formed. Our efforts seek to meet the needs of day-to-day hardships while working to ultimately end homelessness through instilling trust again in people and systems base on the knowledge that we care.",

According to UCLA Public Health experts, poorer neighborhoods lack access to outdoor amenities. Low-income communities don't get sufficient access to this health-promoting resource, and when they do have access, the area tends to be more polluted, the park facilities are not as well-maintained, and there is less park programming and less energy going into the programs offered. In addition to needing access to parks, children need to have awareness of sustainability and the damage human activity can have on native animals and the environment. When they learn about conservation and wildlife, children develop empathy for animals and people, appreciation for natural resources, realize that their actions have consequences, and recognize the value of caring for others and for our planet.",

Our scholarship recipients reflect the diverse demographic of the greater Los Angeles area and provide youth with opportunities to engage with Zoo staff, learn about wildlife and nature, and socialize with peers in an educational environment with structured activities, talks, and animal encounters. Campers explore 133 acres of land comprising over 800 different plant species with 7,000 individual plants. It is home to 1,400 animals representing 270 different species, 58 of which are endangered. The funding of scholarships is vital to providing access to qualified youth. Each year, scholarship applications outnumber available funds, so a randomized lottery is held to choose scholarship recipients. We assist families to secure documentation so all eligible applicants are included in the lottery. Our goal is to give full need-based scholarships to at least 10% of the campers. Camp currently has 960 slots available each summer (120 per week for 8 weeks) and typically sells out. Zoo Camp staff consists of 2 full-time L.A. City employees and 22 full-time seasonal employees including 7 instructors and 15 camp counselors. Camp also utilizes an administrative queuing app called Queue It. Spots sell out so quickly that our system can crash. This virtual waiting room allows control of online traffic in high-demand situations to have a fair registration system.",

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Green Space, Park Access, and Trees",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "As part of GSF's larger mission to increase Angelenos' access to safe, green spaces, we recognize the urgent need to renovate our school gardens to ensure accessibility for all people, regardless of age, disability, or other factors. At each school site, all 2,300 of the Kinder-5th grade students we serve participate in our hands-on, Seed to Table program. Unlike an enrichment program, our classes are held during the student's regular instructional day. Each student spends a minimum of 120 minutes in the garden a month. We currently serve a large population of special needs students. As educators, we've discovered firsthand the need to improve our gardens' accessibility to better serve our students and dismantle the legacy of ableism within the gardening community. Historically, the field of environmental education has prioritized the experiences of able-bodied individuals, creating a legacy of \"eco-ableism,\" a significant issue our project seeks to address directly.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our garden renovation project will directly increase the amount of accessible green spaces for Angelinos while also helping dismantle the legacy of ableism within the larger environmental education field. Once our project is completed, all 10 GSF school gardens will feature ADA-compliant beds, offering our students, their families, and the surrounding communities access to a combined 3 acres of accessible green space. As leaders in the L.A. school gardening community, we believe that the successful completion of our renovation project will set a powerful precedent for the future as well as encourage educators and other nonprofits to prioritize accessibility in their garden and curriculum designs. It is our ultimate goal to see fully accessible gardens at every LAUSD school site, and we believe our project will serve as a replicable model for years to come.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "GSF will raise 84 existing garden beds to ADA compliance. Our school gardens are not only treasured community resources but also serve as the base of operations for our programming. CORE PROGRAMS -Seed to Table: Students visit the garden every other week, alternating between garden and cooking classes. -Cafeteria to Compost: At lunch tables students sort unwanted items from their meals and either redistribute them to other students or compost them. -Farmers Markets: We host free, on-campus Markets 2x/a month at 24th St, sharing an avg.of 2K lbs. of produce with 50+ families per market. MEASURING OUR IMPACT: We use a pre-and-post survey with Kinder and 4th graders, along with a sampling of teachers and families, to gauge our impact. We also annually track the number of volunteers hosted, the amount of food waste diverted from landfills, the pounds of food redistributed, and the opportunities we've created to share our work via workshops, tours, and meetings with local officials.",

As the main bridge connecting urban culture and agriculture, we require support to (1) secure space for a BIPOC agricultural resource center and produce market and to (2) develop programming and agricultural related content to strengthen LA's urban communities' relationship to land and agriculture. Grant monies will be used to establish a BIPOC agricultural hub in the West Adams/South LA region that will serve as a base for connecting youth (18-29) to agricultural resources and economic opportunities. Youth will be connected with farming professionals in rural farming areas such as Allensworth, CA. Youth will be trained in produce sourcing and distribution in the Southern California area. Youth will be trained on how to grow and market their own produce. Grant monies will enable us to create video content for online courses. We will organize field trips to farms in Allensworth, CA, Ridgecrest, CA and the Central Valley. Physical workshops tailored for youth will be conducted and we also plan to create an urban agriculture magazine. Our role as diplomats in the food system is vital. Given LA's limited space to feed its large population, we aim to connect the youth with agricultural education, innovation and federal and state resources.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles County schools have no formal agricultural training for students, but being directly involved in securing one's own food supply is one of the most empowering things a human can do. If our work is successful, youth will see Black Agriculture in action and LA urban youth will grow up knowing that a career in agriculture is possible. If urban youth have a direct connection and relationship with their own food supply, community health increases drastically. Our work represents not only bridging urban culture to agriculture, but also bridging urban culture to the funding and opportunities that the agricultural industry provides. Success in the short term will look a vibrant hub with a high volume of produce sales and deliveries. Success in the medium term will look like regional produce markets/bodegas in SoCal cities. Success in the long run will look like a statewide farmer cooperative and produce network. LA County wins when the underserved become food citizens!",

At least 150 youth (16-29) trained on produce sourcing, sent to Allensworth for a farm visit and/or hired as produce and fruit delivery drivers by August 2024 3. Signed purchasing contracts with at least 10 Black agricultural product producers by August 2024 4.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The legacy of chattel slavery has understandably left Black Americans with a troubled and traumatic relationship with land, farming and agricultural industry. The USDA, CDFA and other American institutions have only added to this trauma by denying access to farm credit and information on sustaining a successful farming enterprise. Long story short, there is a long history of Black Americans being cut off from securing and maintaining their own food supply since the end of slavery. In addition to institutional racism and other barriers, there are also cultural barriers: A culture of Agriculture has not been established in our urban communities. Poverty and lack of access to land, green spaces and knowledge prohibits masses of Black urban inhabitants from even entertaining careers, livelihoods and past times in agriculture. Our organization and statewide agricultural network aims to end that by providing resources and economic opportunities in the world of agriculture.",

Moreover, individuals in disadvantaged communities lack equitable access to lung cancer healthcare, resulting in higher incidence rates compared to other areas in the state. In addition, asthma, a chronic respiratory condition affecting millions of children worldwide, is particularly prevalent in disadvantaged communities. In Southern California, there is a concerning trend of significantly higher asthma rates among young children in low-income areas compared to the national average. Recent data from the Southern California Asthma Consortium reveals that approximately 20% of children aged 2-5 in these communities suffer from asthma, while the national average is 8%.

Awareness of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among Latinx people in the U.S. has been estimated to be 20 years behind awareness in the \"mainstream\" population due to lack of knowledge about the disease; stigma and shame felt in response to their relative's disease-related behaviors; and the paucity of culturally and linguistically matched information and education about the disease to support Spanish-speakers with dementia. As a result, people with dementia do not get appropriate care and their family caregivers report higher rates of depression.

County's Latinx family caregivers and increasing their understanding of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The Project uses the telenovela as the central tool during community education events. Project staff, working with an established network of community-based providers, arrange for screening events of the telenovela, during which they facilitate discussions. The program highlights the struggles of a Latinx family in East L.A. as they experience their grandmother's decline into dementia. Season One introduces the audience to the family; Alzheimer's disease and its warning signs; how to get a diagnosis; and what to expect with disease progression. Season Two follows the same family as the dementia progresses. This Project seeks to improve understanding of the difficult symptoms of ADRD and how to manage them, and how to access medical care and supportive services. The telenovela is available online and on social media. It can be viewed in either English or Spanish, including subtitles to facilitate simultaneous viewing by family members with differing language preferences. The telenovela is freestanding and can be used without training. However, facilitator guides have been developed for use in facilitated group workshops.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In L.A. County, there are nearly 44,000 Latinx people living with a dementia and that number is expected to double in ten years. Dementia is more common in this ethnic group, yet Latinx people are less likely to be diagnosed or receive care. Due to higher levels of poverty and lower levels of education, these conditions are not well understood, and this community faces significant barriers to accessing care. Alzheimer's Los Angeles (LA) seeks to increase awareness about ADRD among the local Latinx community. This innovative intervention permits wider dissemination of complex health knowledge and addresses the stigma that is often associated with dementing conditions. In the short-term, through the telenovela, Alzheimer's LA hopes to reach 200 local Latinx caregiving families in-person and 5,000 online. In the long-term, Alzheimer's LA hopes the telenovela will be used broadly, locally and nationally, to educate families and decrease the stigma that can prevent them from seeking care.",

The data indicated that nearly 90% of the participants stated that watching the telenovela helped them to increase their understanding of Alzheimer's disease; recognize the signs of Alzheimer's (86%); understand the process of getting a diagnosis (84%); and to see how the disease affects the whole family (91%); 97% stated they would recommend watching this telenovela to others. In terms of combating the stigma of Alzheimer's disease, the participants were asked to state their level of embarrassment over disease-related behaviors and how easily they might criticize behaviors. On both items, after watching the telenovela, there were statistically significant declines in levels of embarrassment and tendency to criticize the patient or caregiver."

Ultimately, after the app is in use for one year and widely adopted across end users, we can track alignment across the process, determining where we need more shelters, what kinds of shelters, and what services must be provided in shelters. We can then better understand outstanding needs and work with partners in government, non-profits, and the private sector to improve or build necessary shelter.

Shelter beds, mostly due to COVID, have increased by 62% percent since 2019, but often people experiencing homelessness choose to stay outdoors. The reasons are multifold: still, there are not enough beds; some shelters are congregant and thus unappealing or thought unsafe. But a prevalent reason is because there is no easy way for people experiencing homelessness - at the moment they most need shelter - to determine what shelters are geographically accessible, have availability, and serve specific populations. Today, an unhoused person or caseworker has to call multiple hotlines and shelter locations to secure a bed. This is inefficient and demoralizing - so people abandon their search. An app with real-time information on shelter availability, by location and population served, would be transformative. More people would enter shelters - making them more likely to seek services and ultimately, permanent housing.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Finding an accessible shelter that meets needs and has availability is incredibly challenging. An unhoused woman with a small child living in Venice is unlikely to seek shelter options in Pasadena or East LA. And with so many shelters configured around populations served, this single mom must also find a shelter that takes families with small children. An adult man is unwilling to leave behind the dog that's his only consistent companion. But the only pet-friendly shelter within a thirty-minute drive isn't picking up the phone. Shelter Me - available to people experiencing homelessness, case managers, outreach workers, and government partners - identifies, in real-time, shelter bed availability. Shelter Me is part of our broader app-based portfolio and involves the creation of an intuitive, user-centric app that utilizes location and criteria search (like AirBnB), and provides consistently updated availability (like OpenTable). This same user-friendly, intuitive interface is lacking in current homeless services apps. Shelter Me will enable people to search availability filtered by key criteria, including populations served, geography, pet friendly policies, communal vs. individual accommodations, curfew policies, and more. To incentivize participation for the shelters themselves, we'll provide better technology to the shelters, free of charge. Shelter Me will move more people into shelter more efficiently, enabling a critical first step towards permanent housing.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "A 2022 National Alliance to End Homelessness report concluded that, nationally, 40% of people experiencing homelessness are unsheltered. But across L.A., it's almost double that. The unsheltered are less likely to use government and non-profit services, and more likely to have health issues or be in unsafe situations. Housing is the ultimate stabilizing force, and shelters are the key entry point into permanent housing. Shelter Me can connect people experiencing homelessness - and their case managers - to shelters with open beds. Once in shelter, service leaders can better assess individuals and provide support and solutions, leading to better outcomes. Because L.A. continues to lack sufficient shelter beds, an app like Shelter Me can help assess current shelter utilization and determine where and what kinds of shelters are needed. Put simply: with Shelter Me, we know that more people will move from the streets to shelter to housing, faster, in the short, medium, and long-term."

They teach students the skills they need to be successful in today's world. STEAM skills are essential for many careers, and they are also important for everyday life. Many schools lack in this area, leaving students to fend for themselves if they are interested in these subjects. Some students don't know they are interested because they have never been exposed or given the opportunity to try it. Children need to be able to use their imagination, use their hands to make and build things, and problem-solve with their peers. Kids need to be kids. This is a vulnerable age to learn and grow. In a rapidly changing world, it is difficult to predict what skills children will need to be successful in science, technology, engineering, art and math.

The Watts Community (pop 40,000) in south central Los Angeles is predominantly non-White (74% Hispanic, 24% Black) and faces enormous inequities due to systemic racism, with the lowest median household income ($29,600; 43% below median) and one of the lowest employment rates in Los Angeles. These socioeconomic inequities have led to inequities in health, brought to light during the COVID pandemic. During the VaccinateLA campaign we began to address some of these areas of inequity as part of how we established trust within the community, when trying to get its members vaccinated. Our social media campaign was part of a collaborative, multi-sector effort that contributed to a 6-month increase in south LA vaccinations - 30% more than predicted.",

The effort also laid the groundwork of trusted relationships as a result of creating content with people from that community, specifically for that community. Some of the residents joined our production company as trainees. This grant will allow us to intentionally hire more youth from Watts and provide a media internship program. Interns will receive didactic training from ECE's industry veterans, hands-on experience in videography, interviews, editing, sound mixing and social media content creation. In parallel, they will receive hands-on training as production assistants on a feature-length health documentary project, an extension of the short film. Interns will be empowered by their new skills and our support to create videos and films on health topics of their choice in their community, and shared throughout the community.

One of the many challenges to treating mental health is the lack of continuity of care. For at-risk older adults experiencing housing insecurity, a missed connection with a provider can have serious life-threatening consequences. Digital health tools are powerful ways to support mental health care. The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a significant increase in telehealth usage, about 78 times (Mckinsey & Company). This radical shift has facilitated easier and greater access to health care, redefining our approach to health care to meeting people where they are. The success of SCAN's Cyber Senior program, which has observed a 68% increase in technology engagement after completion, underscores the potential of digital literacy training. The proposed initiative aims to merge this effective digital literacy training with mental health support to increase access and help these at-risk seniors overcome the barriers imposed by their unstable living situations.",

Conversely, Cyber Senior delivers digital literacy education and training to older adults and their caregivers, offering them practical tools to enhance their overall health, wellness, and connectedness. IAH annually serves over 23,000 non-SCAN health plan members at no-cost with community-based services, helping older adults and caregivers through health and social complexities. This initiative uniquely combines both programs for a dual-purpose approach to remove barriers to mental health care access for older adults experiencing housing instability. Increasing awareness about online mental health services and teaching platform usage instills self-sufficiency among older adults - empowering them to take charge of their mental health journey. In summary, focusing on digital literacy as a pathway to mental health support significantly impacts older adults facing housing insecurity, providing them with convenient, stable, accessible care, key factors in effective mental health treatment.",

In the long term, the ambition is to create a scalable model to improve health care access through digital literacy. Success means decreased untreated health issues and enhanced digital know-how among at-risk seniors. SCAN's commitment to innovative, evidence-based practices is demonstrated by its intention to publish results in peer-reviewed journals and share best practices with the community. This influences how SCAN shapes future programming to address health equity for senior citizens on a larger scale, aiming to redefine elderly care not only in Los Angeles County, but also to serve as a blueprint for other regions.",

Although hundreds of LA organizations are dedicated to education, environment, gardens, public health, safety, social welfare, and water with related projects, programs and locations, systemic overlaps, gaps and lack of awareness reduce the potential impact of these resources. By overlaying shared use of open spaces such as existing schoolyards, parks, libraries, vacant land, etc. with resiliency hubs, we could quickly and efficiently activate \"Neighborhood Resource Gardens\" throughout Los Angeles before hosting the Olympics in 2028.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Neighborhood Resource Gardens provide opportunities to connect existing resources with places that address community needs for equitable, healthy and beautiful civic space. The impact zone of each site extends well beyond individual locations to serve entire neighborhoods. Fostering community and personal connections offer opportunities for more individual empathy and empowerment, increasing neighborhood bonds and safety. Environmental education provides students of all ages access to critical information for improving their own health and well-being, as well as the Earth's. Neighborhood Resource Gardens engage individual and community groups at the local level while connecting with larger entities in LA and beyond to connect resources that help activate, program, maintain and network these sites. Successful implementation of the NRG program would improve the well-being and resilience of environments and neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles in both the short and long term.",

Neighborhood Emergency Kits = Communications Hub, Disaster Preparedness, Energy Off-Grid, Food and Potable Water. 2. Urban Gardens = Color, Composting, Drought Tolerant Flora, Edible Plants and Fragrance. 3. NRG Network Participation = Civic Events, Community Engagement, Environmental Education, Horticultural Guidance, Resource Registry Currently the El Nido Family Center in Pacoima serves as our case study for advancing an existing community hub from \"surviving to thriving\". This pilot project showcases the process of first assessing needs at a civic space by assessing what elements of the program a location \"has\", \"needs\" and \"wants\". Next we identify resources and facilitate connections with entities whose missions align, offering opportunities to participate and amplify the impact of their resources. The model also offers potential for community engagement, environmental education, and workforce development, showcasing paths to participate and scale the initiative to have a NRG in every neighborhood ASAP!",

The success of the NRG pilot project at the El Nido Family Center in Pacoima will showcase how needs can be addressed through connections facilitated with the NRG program. Success would increase accessibility for community members to utilize the garden, community spaces, and be prepared in case of need. The program will scale by offering opportunities for networks of existing civic places with public open spaces like libraries, parks, community gardens, schoolyards, and public rights of way, to network and connect with other civic organizations whose missions align with neighborhood, resiliency, and/or horticulture.

Entering adulthood, we often don't have the proper skill sets for conflict or anxiety management-at times leading us down some escapism paths or alternate forms of coping mechanisms. This can be seen through overusing technological devices, abusing substances, and more. As a result, the journey into adulthood and being an adult can seem quite lonely. In a 2020 Harvard study, \"36% of all Americans-including 61% of young adults (aged 16-25) and 51% of mothers with young children-feel 'serious loneliness.'\" This number has increased since then. From heart disease, anxiety, and depression, loneliness often turns into multiple types of health ailments. AH|MA (pronounced \"ahh-ma\") is here to combat that level of loneliness by providing something healthier people can turn towards-touching people's hearts and souls through our immersive storytelling.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Even through the tough life moments that leave us feeling quite lonely, we're here to remind people that we are not alone. From caregiving to adolescents' stress, AH|MA provides immersive storytelling activities that help us connect with ourselves first-either relating to the storyteller or through breath-work. Our project is unique in its approach. Built with behavioral psychology in mind, AH|MA introduces a fun and interactive approach to build new neural pathways-mainly giving us the opportunity to expand our mindsets and deepen our memory retention through immersive learning. AH|MA will create five different types of stories that users can engage and view through our content platform. These five types are 1) animation 2) nature environment 3) real-life stories of impactful people 4) impactful social causes 5) visualization activities to connect with self. We'll build in breath-work so that those who may be meditatively resistant get introduced to an alternate form of mindfulness practice. Ultimately, our content's designed to attract people of all ages and demographics, eradicate the stigma behind mindful practice through the power of storytelling, and provide an alternate form of entertainment and engagement learning. We know we can't remove all the loneliness in the world, but we can construct an innovative tool that allows the community to access stories that foster empathy within the collective, bolster our psyche, and serve as a reminder that we are not alone.",

WWLA is committed to, through the efforts of its expert Certified Enrollment Counselors/Health Plan Navigators, ensuring 100% of Medi-Cal members are informed - and appropriately re-enrolled. Most WWLA clients, and potential clients, are considered a hard-to-reach population. Often, due to unique cultural individualities, they lack knowledge of healthy living programs, lack access to healthcare services, and are at risk of slipping through the healthcare safety net because of limited resources to access these services.

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, for two large communities within WWLA's service area, Boyle Heights residents are 94.0% Latino and 52.4% foreign-born, while Pico Rivera residents are 85.4% Latino and 64.6% foreign-born. WWLA expects during the 12-month grant period, to provide healthcare plan enrollment and retention assistance to over 3,000 clients applying for or retaining healthcare.

Music classes align with state/national core standards using a culturally responsive approach. We listen and respond to our partners in real time to meet our schools' needs. This includes STEAM-focused lessons, multimedia, music tech, strategies for students with special needs, music therapy, and healing-centered practices. Furthermore, we make the programming unique to the community and its specific needs, reaching every student in the school. We also give professional development for school teachers to integrate music with the core curriculum, guidance for principals, and parent workshops to share the importance and benefits of music education.

Schools need guidance to build long-term, comprehensive music programs amidst \"a huge hole of qualified arts teachers\" (capradio, 6/23). Research shows students enrolled in school arts programs have higher attendance and reading levels, fewer discipline problems, higher graduation rates, and stronger social-emotional skills. Unfortunately, music education continues to be fragmented in approach. \"It's a moral issue...a huge equity gap.\" (Laura Smyth, CA Alliance for Arts Ed).

Individuals are often unprepared or underprepared to face real-life situations when they return from incarceration and experience challenges using new technology, adjusting to social norms, and interacting in social environments. These factors hinder successful reintegration, perpetuate cycles of marginalization, and increase the risk of recidivism. Black and Latino youth and adults living in Los Angeles face additional barriers to reintegration as a result of historic disinvestment that have left the communities we serve devastated and with insufficient resources. Made New Foundation tackles these challenges by bringing VR and AI directly to formerly incarcerated and at-risk youth and adults to develop their real-life social and life skills.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "With the support of LA2050, Made New Foundation will implement an innovative VR and AI program to support the unmet needs of reentering and at-risk/system-involved youth and adults in LA. This will include real-life VR and AI environments that acclimate individuals to the changing world around them and support the development of core life skills. Activities include: - VR Scenarios: In partnership with ASU we will create four VR scenarios that address how to use modern technology (e.g., ATM machines, self-checkout), interacting in social environments, coping with triggering situations, and more. Scenarios are developed by individuals with lived experience to ensure we are meeting our population's needs. - VR/AI Bus: Using a fully equipped VR/AI bus, we will travel to local schools to expose youth to innovative technology while preparing them for real world situations. The bus will also be deployed to transitional homes, community events, and partner agencies. - CBT and Life Skills: We partner with a licensed psychiatrist and other professionals in the development of our scenarios to ensure they incorporate CBT and core life skills including de-escalation, conflict resolution, problem-solving, and other relevant competencies. - AI Chatbot: We will streamline access to supportive services by leveraging AI to collect client information, match them with services, and facilitate connections with service providers.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "AOL represents formerly incarcerated immigrants in appellate matters before the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and the Ninth Circuit. Far too often, incarcerated immigrants are forced to go through their removal proceedings pro se, or unrepresented, on a detained docket that moves at a rapid pace. Given the fact that they are incarcerated in facilities that are often hundreds of miles away from city centers and access to high-quality legal representation and resources they need to successfully pursue their claims, detained immigrants tend to have high rates of denial in their cases. Often, the issue on which the individual's claim was denied is appealable. The appeals process at both the BIA and the Ninth Circuit moves very slowly, and detained immigrants may bail out of custody while the appeal is pending. Appellate representation is time-consuming and onerous, and we currently have limited capacity to engage significantly in the appellate process. However, we want to ensure our formerly incarcerated clients have dedicated representation in this legal area as it can literally make the difference between being deported back to harm and persecution or remaining lawfully in the United States. This grant would support our goal of drastically increasing high-quality appellate representation for formerly incarcerated individuals by assigning a dedicated Staff Attorney to do this work as their sole focus.",

We engage in appellate representation of formerly incarcerated individuals before the Board of Immigration Appeals and Ninth Circuit. Using our legal expertise, we identify appealable legal issues and work with our clients to raise these issues on appeal. AOL staff are not only experts on the legal complexities of navigating immigration appeals for formerly incarcerated immigrants, but also our staff includes formerly incarcerated individuals who bring first-hand lived experience to our work. AOL staff have decades of combined experience connecting clients with non-legal resources to ensure holistic, humane case management.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In working closely with detained immigrants, we have witnessed firsthand how often the legal cases of detained non-citizens seeking safety or relief from deportation are denied. Given Los Angeles County's proximity to the United States-Mexico border and numerous immigration detention centers, it is a place where many immigrants find themselves after leaving detention while a final decision in their immigration cases remains pending. The appeals process can take months if not years, and non-citizens with pending appeals are left in a sort of anxious limbo. Expanding our holistic legal representation, which includes both zealous legal representation in the appellate process as well as connecting our clients with resources such as healthcare, food, shelter, and other necessities, will ensure that Los Angeles County is a more humane, dignified place for vulnerable immigrants fighting deportation to live.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "AOL has the capacity to track qualitative and quantitative measures of success and impact. Quantitative measures employed are tracking the completion of intakes, case filings, case outcomes, social services support, and case management progress points as defined by our internal metrics. AOL also tracks demographic data, application type, and other metrics as required for grant reporting. Qualitatively, we consider legal services to be a formalized form of storytelling, and we build our collective knowledge through sharing our observations, the experiences we hear from clients and their families and communities, and other narratives that inform our process and outcomes. In the appellate realm, we have obtained successful outcomes in 8 appeals and currently have 7 Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") appeals pending, 4 petitions for review pending, and 3 motions pending with the BIA."

The \"To-Go\" Meal Delivery Program supplements the Truck by distributing meals to individuals in additional areas of LA. Currently, 400 meals are pre-made by FMP and Church of the Good Shepherd volunteers and delivered six days a week by two drivers.

We believe that an ideal number to begin with is an average of 45 guests per session. By keeping the sessions at this size, we can ensure an intimate and immersive listening experience that captivates our attendees and allows for meaningful interactions. This setting will also encourage open discussions and allow us to gain valuable insights from our attendees. We'll provide follow-up online surveys and evaluation forms for both our guests, talented DJs, and visiting lecturers.

This greatly increases risks for mother and baby. Additionally, with rising rates of homelessness (especially among pregnant people and families with small children) and increased mental-health challenges, Claris' services remain in demand. While LA is rich with resources, they are often hard to access. There is urgency to unite agencies to make it easier for people to receive integrated care.

The first three days of learning routinely tackle water - historical questions about access and development, current infrastructural issues, and environmental concerns. They meet with experts and, when conditions permit, visit a Metropolitan Water District treatment and testing facility. From there, students meet one Saturday a month to take on additional topics. As they move through the year, they pair their neighborhood knowledge with this infrastructural information to strategize how they can address their concerns. LASA has been doing this work since 2012 and continues to build and evolve. The groups of high school juniors change year to year and graduate into a growing group of LASA alums. Yearly, we add new schools and cover new neighborhoods. We have a community of experts who work with us to guide, mentor, and support the students. The issues we address, and the experts we invite, are constantly evaluated to be responsive to the moment while still addressing longer range infrastructural concerns. In the past few years, LASA has added segments on public health as well as fire management, and has engaged with efforts on water-recycling as part of LASA's more traditional water studies.

When we launched LASA more than a decade ago, we had a vision that, someday before long, LASA graduates would be professionally involved in civic service across the LA Basin. That these young people might choose professional directions in part because of this program was thrilling to contemplate. Today, we have proof-of-concept data that points to this hope and this vision. But our dreams about LASA run deeper than the joy of seeing this or that graduate find work and fulfillment in civic and civil service. What is now even more exciting to ponder (and hope for) is that LASA graduates would find problemsolving connections across sectors, that their history of civic engagement from the time that they were sixteen years old, will pay hopeful and helpful dividends years later.

While other vocational programs focus on menial tasks, we use music as a vehicle for change. Music therapy is well-established in K-12 ASD services as an effective therapy for ASD children. Researchers have discussed advanced music memory, responsiveness & aptitudes within the adult ASD population. However, no other org has used music as a vehicle for supporting adults with ASD in vocational training! This project will assist ASD adults with skills specific to music industry AND transferable professional & social skills. This grant will help: 1. Develop JHFA curriculum. Stage 1 addresses music-industry knowledge. Stage 2 focuses on 4 career tacks: performance, composition, music administration & teaching. JHFA will offer courses digitally through online platform Moodle in-person, digitally or hybrid. 2. Create internships. JHFA will partner with a variety of local orgs to deliver aligned internships for each career track (Melrose Trading Post, Kayne Eras Center, Music is Unity & the Cities of Pasadena & Culver City). Each musician will receive one-on-one coaching including portfolio dev & guidance with self-promotion from JHFA staff. 3. Promote a digital music library. JHFA will launch & promote the first music library of songs specifically by artists with ASD.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We know JHFA effectively promotes music industry career opportunities for adults with ASD. To date, JHFA has helped over 200 musicians with ASD complete over 180+ gigs, 75% of which were paid. Between 2021 & 2022, there was a 21% increase in the number of gig/work opportunities for our musicians & a 125% increase in earnings! Building on these successes, JHFA will track progress of goals (no.8) & key metrics using a combination of pre/post tests (auditions, recitals), teacher surveys (monthly reports & report card submitted every trimester), self-reported outcomes, audience reports & employer surveys. JHFA employs a FT Ops Director & PT Analyst tasked with tracking key metrics & evaluating/improving the program. This program fundamentally improves the life experiences of adults with ASD living in LA. One student commented, \"JHFA has enriched my life for the better because it has given me more opportunities to express myself through my music & opened doors for me to meet new people.\"",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Over 5.4 MILLION adults in the US have ASD. The CDC estimates CA is home to the largest proportion (701,669). Knowing LA comprises 25% of CA's population (2021 census), we estimate over 175,000 Angelenos have ASD! This population is growing. Each year, 50,000 teenagers with ASD across the nation turn 18 & age out of school-based services. Upon leaving school, there are very few services available - 1/4 receive no postsecondary services. ASD Adults struggle with social interactions, making employment difficult. That renders over 90% unemployed or underemployed! UNDER 10% of adults with ASD have a financially stable, meaningful life. Lack of employment leads to loneliness and amplified social challenges. Adults with ASD are 4x more likely to experience loneliness than neurotypical adults. As such, JHFA provides employment skills & advocacy for adults with ASD. Reflecting on how JHFA has changed their life, one student stated, \"without JHFA I would feel lonely and without purpose.\""

At KFAM, the mental health services will be free for underserved, immigrant, at-risk and low income individuals who have no where else to go for mental health services.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "KFAM has provide mental health services to the community for forty years, since 1983. But we are always limited on how many people we can serve due to funding. We measure our impact on how many therapy sessions are offered, how many clients we serve and how many clients can graduate from our mental health services and live their lives controlling their struggles.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Mental Health access is very limited to the AAPI Community even though there is a large AAPI population in Southern California. Many of the services available and resources are offered are only available in English or Spanish. Navigating the Mental Health system is already difficult for anyone but being a limited English speaker, being an immigrant or not understanding the system of receiving mental health therapy, medication support and other critical services to live a healthy life is a huge barrier for many AAPI individuals. Mental Health support is very foreign to the AAPI community. Also to add all the cultural stigma and barriers that often hinder AAPIs to ask for professional help needs to be lifted through education, outreach and bringing more awareness of the services available to these individuals. Many AAPI individuals seek out for Mental Health help when it's their last option. KFAM would like to make Mental Health support one of their first options.",

If Mental Health services are offered to this specific population, to actually serve and provide services in mental health, it will create healthier individuals who will be able to contribute to the community as a whole. These individuals will hold jobs, create jobs, pay taxes, be better parents, happier children, increase civic participation, contribute to the community and maybe even cure a illness or two. When an individual's mental health is strong, healthy and in a good place, anything is possible. KFAM hopes to start in our local southern California community but hope our work would continue through the state and entire nation to help create healthier mental health lives for AAPI individuals.",

We envision a Los Angeles where LGBTQ+ youth feel supported, safe, and empowered. No LGBTQ+ youth will face dropping out of school or feeling isolated because of who they are. Our program will eliminate those challenges and increase access to mentoring for LGBTQ+ youth. LGBTQ+ youth will move on from our program graduating high school and college, forming deep relationships with their peers, and building the next new world-changing business In this grant year, we will reach 100 youth and engage 25 LGBTQ+ adult mentors.

Results of our survey state that 92% of youth felt the program was a safe space, and 95% said the program helped them understand their identity. One youth said, \"I got to hear older queer people's experiences and thoughts, and it gave me comfort knowing that things can go well and you can get that far in life while being queer.\" Our first program, Storytelling Lab, guides youth through identity and self-exploration workshops with real-world applications to their stories. We pair youth in groups with LGBTQ+ adult mentors who provide group and one-on-one mentoring to support. Our second program, Accelerator Lab, challenges LGBTQ+ youth to create their business ideas in teams and pitch them to LGBTQ+ professionals in a final Demo Day showcase supported by LGBTQ+ adult mentors. Our third program, Youth Council, supports the next generation of LGBTQ+ youth through leadership workshops, financial literacy, and career education over nine months with individual mentors.

We successfully ran each of these proposed programming labs from 2021 - 2023. We're now expanding the foundation of our success where we go from a series of programs to an after-school program. Program goals include: (1) Build positive mentor/mentee relationships; (2) Build positive peer relationships; and (3) Provide an environment for LGBTQ+ youth that is safe and inclusive. We'll conduct a post-program survey with youth and mentors to measure these goals. We anticipate the following outcomes: - 90% of mentees report having a positive relationship with their mentor at the end of the program - 90% of mentors report having a positive relationship with their mentee(s) at the end of the program - 90% of youth participants report that they enjoyed connecting to other young people in the queer community - 90% of youth participants report that the program was a safe space for them",

Trevor Project found that 39% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered suicide in the past 12 months. With over 10% of youth in California schools identifying as LGBTQ+ (58,000 in Los Angeles Unified), these numbers are startling. Typically, youth mentoring programs protect against these factors, but there is a significant gap for LGBTQ+ youth. MENTOR National, a national mentoring organization, states for every 5,000 youth mentoring programs, only five focus on LGBTQ+ youth. A recent report by MENTOR suggests mentoring relationships could reduce feelings of distress among LGBTQ+ youth while supporting improvements in their peer and family relationships.",

County's low-income communities of color most impacted by disparity due to historic disinvestment in parks and green spaces. The need for expanded urban forestry, school greening, and access to rivers and parks is evident and has wide-reaching impacts on public and environmental health. A recent CalEPA study found eastern L.A. County has the state's worst urban heat island, raising temperatures as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit and exacerbating extreme heat days. The American Lung Association's annual State of the Air ranks L.A.'s air among the nation's unhealthiest, causing long-term cardiovascular disease. L.A.

This collaborative and unifying vision is inspired by the 1930 Olmsted-Bartholomew Plan for the Los Angeles Region, which called for protection of upper watersheds, creation of a robust urban river greenway network, and for all public schools to serve as parks to protect public health and balance the built urban environment with nature. If we can successfully implement this vision today, we can help protect the natural resources (air, water, and biodiversity) we depend on, reduce heat island impact to most vulnerable populations, provide equitable access to nature, promote active transit, and celebrate our shared natural history and cultural heritage.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "EDLA! addresses these issues by providing high-quality, culturally competent dance education and enrichment programming for students ages 4 to 18 at two sites in MacArthur Park/Koreatown and Pico/Union. EDLA! teaches many dance forms: ballet, modern, hip hop, breaking, jazz, salsa, Afro-Brazilian, West African, and Mexican folklorico. We align our dance curriculum with the Visual and Performing Arts Content Standards under California Dance Standards. To enhance students' emotional self-regulation and social-emotional learning, we offer a mindfulness practice in each After-School class. During the school year, students learn historical and cultural knowledge of dance and develop the motor skills and technical abilities that are part of a classical dance program, including stamina, strong muscles, flexibility, and coordination. Most After-School dancers participate in more than one dance form a week and spend several afternoons in our studios. Because they can matriculate to higher levels of advanced dance, most of our students remain at EDLA! for 7+ years. Many are with us from ages 4 or 5 to 18. We give students opportunities to perform in the community and in an end-of-year recital, attend professional dance shows, and participate in master classes. The Summer Session includes two week-long summer camps for new students who learn multiple forms of dance and present an end-of-camp show. Returning students also try new styles of dance during the six-week Summer Session."

Along with New York and San Fransisco, Los Angeles has over 43% of this population, with an estimated 270,000+ Chinese immigrants calling this county home. These are our neighbors, our colleagues, our classmates, and, sadly, our homeless, impoverished, and racially targeted. There is a Chinese proverb that says, \"If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.\" The goal of Infinite Potential Community Outreach is to teach as many people to fish as possible - to give our Chinese brothers and sisters a chance at a better life for themselves and their families through education and mentorship. We hope to continue this program in perpetuity. We will start with an initial goal of helping 300 people in the year.

He will also be calling upon the help/knowledge of colleagues to provide a wider range of perspectives and information for this underserved community.

Some material covered will include business help and advice, interview training, basic tax advice, entrepreneurial help, and more. To accommodate the language barrier, we will be making my programs and events available in both Mandarin and English. Most importantly, we want to provide these individuals with the safe space, resources, and support that my parents never had.

From forced sex trafficking in illegal massage parlors to hate crimes like the devastating shooting in Monterey Park to large corporations taking over small Chinese businesses, leaving owners unable to keep up with rising rent as with Redcar's recent purchase of the Dynasty Center in Chinatown, this inequality and targeting of the Chinese people in Los Angeles has been a problem since the 1800s and is even more prevalent in today's society. Many victims of this inequality and targeting don't have the resources to grow or keep their businesses. They do not have tech knowledge or understand how to file taxes properly, and they do not have culturally appropriate interview skills to secure better lives for their families. They do not have the mentor my parents so badly needed. - Endy Zhou"

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In 2020, the LA County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) in conjunction with the Oral Health Program of Los Angeles released a report detailing findings from their survey on the oral health status of LA County children under age 18. The report showed significant improvements since 2005 in the early detection and resolution of oral health decay of young children due to earlier prevention programs. While Los Angeles County children saw improvement to overall oral health, the report found that roughly half of all LA County children have experienced tooth decay before entering kindergarten. The data highlighted glaring disparities in oral health condition for children of color and those identified from socioeconomically disadvantaged settings. Also, surveys show disparities in the dental workforce with California below the national average at 8% for Blacks and Latinos. KCDC's programs work to address the health disparity for low-income children and the diversity inequity in dentistry.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "KCDC programs are designed around the education, prevention, detection, intervention and restoration of tooth decay and other oral health problems for disadvantaged children in LA County while encouraging community outreach and public health awareness and by training and mentoring diversity students toward (high paying) dental careers to increase the number of diverse providers. KCDC is a child-friendly, safety net clinic and one of very few pediatric dental clinics in Southern California offering low-cost comprehensive dental care for low income, uninsured children. This funding would allow KCDC to integrate early prevention in children with workforce development starting with oral health education and eradicating decay in children and by engaging them through career talks to become dental hygienists and dentists to better serve the communities of which they are a part. Tooth decay is a serious issue in a child's health, can lead to infection and can affect overall healthy physical development and growth and yet, it is the number one chronic condition in children. Many children from socioeconomically disadvantaged situations have never been to the dentist and because tooth decay hinders a child's ability to thrive, KCDC is proposing a variety of dental programs that will result in impacting 2,342 individuals, including 2300 children, at least 38 children gaining access to dental treatments and full restoration of cavities, and training for 4 BIPOC predental students.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "San Fernando Valley",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "KCDC will continue existing local programs of providing preventative care and education (in preschool and elementary school settings). We impact children at the youngest ages, before they have decay. Dental programs lower overall decay rates of the schools where we have gone before and establish a baseline for new schools so that we can measure the decay rates in students year after year. Lowering decay has an immediate impact on attendance-dental pain from poor oral health results in 874,000 missed school days in California alone-KCDC's programs have contributed to the recent statistical improvements for LA County children's oral health but more needs to be done. Fear of dentistry is the greatest barrier to oral health but when parents and children see someone who looks like them performing the services, it greatly reduces that fear establishing better rapport. Increasing diversity in the dental workforce while expanding preventative treatments are the core of KCDC's mission.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "KCDC provides free dental programs in schools to see oral health improvement. Decay rates are lowered at schools where we visit annually. Usually, in the first year of schools receiving the free program, about a third to half of the children show current, unaddressed decay -- often painful, and transmissible. We see a reduction in decay year after year until the decay rate is reduced to under 20% for the total population. Parents of children with urgent issues, and/or decay including rampant are encouraged by school staff to receive free dental care to eradicate decay. About 4% of the children, from screenings become patients. To evaluate our work, we measure the value of free services, # of urgent cases, # of children with decay, # of parental consent for preventative care, # of new patients and overall program value. We track the number of diverse predental students, # of volunteer hours, costs of training, # of admissions to dental schools.",

Between 2020-2021, there were 1,988 deaths of PEH, up from 1,271 deaths the year before. BIPOC who are also PWUD are often disproportionately linked to fentanyl due to factors related to systemic racism. The overdose mortality rates within the Black communities surpassed the deaths of whites beginning in 2018 (NCBI, 2021). The number of accidental overdoses is increasing due to individuals' inability to access mental health/substance use treatment services/presence of fentanyl.",

What was once a communal practice invented by People of Color all over the world is now considered a sport and culture predominantly composed of white men. Whether it's settler colonialism that pushed Indigenous People of Color away from coastlines or forced POC into a relationship of labor and trauma with the ocean; a systemic exclusion from water and swimming through the Jim Crow era, or an establishment of cultural norms (\"Black people don't swim\") and embedded exclusionary practices like redlining; surfing embodies marginalization that harms us all, with greatest impact on BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and disabled people. This is greatly reflected in the existing adaptive surf community where BIPOC participation is limited to a handful of individuals in a growing field of recreation and competitive sports for disabled people.",

The chance for our community to develop a model for surf instruction training that involves our anti-racist philosophies and disability justice principles that could be used well after this project by us and others is a distinct pillar of success for us. Then, as we seed and grow the practice of making surfing a safer place for disabled people of color to heal and play, the implications of that move far beyond the project window. Ty has been our guiding light in this all, constantly showing us that there are deeper levels of belonging that we can create for our people. Our vision is that this becomes a lasting and integral aspect of our community as a whole. A space where we can receive all those who suffer from the harm of systemic racism and have the intention and the capacity to support them as they are.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "A 2023 Urban Institute brief points to disproportionately high debt among young adults: they have limited income, haven't built a credit history, are unable to save; and have trouble repaying loans. Young adults seek the confidence and knowledge to improve their community. Paid leadership development opportunities for youth from families of meager or modest means, or groups met with discrimination or other systemic obstacles are in short supply but young adults hold tremendous power and, with support, can use their lived experiences to shape policymaking. They're a force for good in our communities and society, and YI shifts cultural narratives around youth as a time of opportunity and growth, especially for first-generation students. Programs like YI's can decrease social isolation and improve mental health. Access to information and resources are critical as young adults constitute Los Angeles' largest age demographic. Our YAP provides a resilient pathway to economic security.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Established in 2017, the Young Advocates Program, a twelve-week paid program, was incubated in Los Angeles to provide a dynamic learning curriculum of hard and soft skills to strengthen young adult power. Advocates are primarily recruited from community colleges, work-based learning programs, and through alumni/peer mentors. They learn about issues affecting their generation including borrower protections, CalSavers, CalEITC, and, benefit program eligibility, and realize possibilities toward economic security, learning media relations, storytelling, social media communications, policymaking, engaging with elected officials and government agencies, colleges, employers, conducting research, and organizing events to educate and facilitate discussions among their peers. Our leadership development program addresses income inequity by providing a paid opportunity for young adults to connect with peers and become civically-involved. YI helps young adults develop protective factors that moderate risk for adversity and facilitate resiliency, including intellectual development, self-esteem, problem-solving skills, connections with school and peers, and opportunities for engagement with school and community. Many of our young adults find future work placement because of the relationships they build in this process. Each young adult is provided mentorship that supports them and provides guidance on their education and career goals. These factors lend to both economic security and equity.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "YI measures our impact toward economic equity, i.e. college matriculation, community college completion, etc., through a combination of quantitative and qualitative data both from our young adults, and local and state reports. YI collects and analyzes pre- and post-YAP surveys ensuring measurable value. Our program goals are specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, time-bound, inclusive, and equitable (SMARTIE). We track program applicants and participants, including socioeconomic background, race or ethnicity, or gender, and engagements (i.e. invited testimony). YI tracks different levels of policy wins. YI uses surveys to track partner engagement (e.g. in coalitions, webinars), i.e. youth development organizations; education systems; employers, etc.). YI assesses our young adults' experiences with systemic obstacles; tracks endorsements, i.e. partner implementation of YI's recommendations; event attendees; media hits; and, policy recommendations adopted by key stakeholders.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "More than 25% of the County's population includes young adults 18-34 years-the largest age group. Improving economic outcomes for this demographic has a positive ripple effect for all. Gaps in income, employment, homeownership, student debt, and retirement savings are damaging to the economy broadly. Young adults need higher wages, more stable incomes, better and cheaper access to housing and month-to-month household necessities, greater opportunities for asset-building and retirement savings, and a lower debt burden. Policymakers are well-positioned to address these challenges, and our Young Advocates have designed the solutions. From laws protecting borrowers' rights to expanded voting rights, California is an innovator. Young adults learn from peers and social media, and enriching both of these activities will increase our reach toward measurable gains. Strengthening our community partnerships through geotargeting and in-person consumer education events will expand our reach."

The campaign will make Los Angeles a leader in TS awareness and a pillar of neurodiversity. The first step will be to deploy our engaging resources that detail the recognition of symptoms of TS and the steps to receiving a diagnosis through ad campaigns in local digital, TV, radio, and print media. These ads will encourage people to attend community informational sessions and webinars to learn more. We will also develop digital content to be shared on social media by the TAA and through collaborations with influencer partners and advocates. We will make partnerships with local education institutions like LAUSD by distributing materials to schools, conducting awareness workshops for educators, and collaborating with schools to include TS awareness in health education curricula. By leveraging partnerships through our UCLA Center of Excellence, we will do the same in healthcare institutions, encouraging providers to learn how to recognize and treat TS in their patients, particularly encouraging training in CBIT, the only behavioral therapy proven to effectively treat TS. Keeping in mind the heightened undiagnosed rate in underserved communities, our campaign will include tailored outreach to these populations, including Spanish content, ensuring we reach everyone in Los Angeles County.",

This leads to a cycle of systemic discrimination against our community. Low diagnosis rates mean we are unable to prove how many people are affected. Without accurate prevalence numbers, we cannot make the strongest arguments for support, which ultimately results in a lack of funding and awareness. This deters medical professionals from specializing in treatment or research of TS, which perpetuates low diagnosis rates. This problem is particularly impactful in underserved communities (BIPOC, low income, Spanish-speaking) facing barriers to access to healthcare. As a result, lack of awareness leads people with TS face stigma at school, work, and in their community. Until awareness and funding for TS catches up to its prevalence, we will be left behind and misunderstood. We need to be seen and accepted as we are.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "As a result of this campaign, Los Angeles County will become the leading example of a community that embraces its neurodiversity and encourages its people to #TICfreely. By increasing diagnosis rates in Los Angeles County, our program will provide relief and hope to Angelenos who previously may not have even known there was a name for their problem. With a diagnosis, they will be able to receive appropriate accommodations in school or their workplace, setting them up for improved short and long-term success. Los Angeles will also see an increase in healthcare providers who can recognize and treat TS, reducing wait times for doctors' visits and the rate of misdiagnosis. By educating employers, teachers, medical professionals, and the LA community about TS, increased awareness will also reduce the stigma that our community faces, which will have a measurable impact on the mental health and social wellbeing of Angelenos with lived experience of TS and neurodiversity.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We are committed to addressing the root causes of homelessness and housing insecurity by expanding the supply of affordable housing. YIGBY is a feasible solution that has immediate potential for scaling. A 2020 policy brief by the Terner Center identified nearly 5,000 acres of faith-based land in LA County that could potentially be utilized for affordable housing. Recognized as an effective option, the government is looking to pass a bill to streamline the approval process for housing development owned by religious institutions under California Senate Bill 4. Furthermore, YIGBY enables these institutions to extend their mission of serving vulnerable populations while gaining a valuable source of revenue. In addition to piloting YIGBY in La Canada, we plan to partner with more faith-based organizations to build affordable housing for vulnerable populations and the unhoused on their land, as well as increase the ability of other affordable housing nonprofits to adopt this approach.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Los Angeles City and County have the highest number of people experiencing homelessness in the country-with an estimated 65,000 unhoused individuals in 2022. The need for affordable housing extends beyond people experiencing homelessness. It also includes low-income individuals and families on the verge of losing their homes because they cannot afford rent. According to the latest Housing Needs Assessment for Los Angeles, there has been a 25% increase in market rents since 2018, and inflation is greatly reducing the income available to meet housing costs. Furthermore, 60% of renter households pay more than 30% of their income on housing-more than any major American city. To keep families in their homes and to build diverse, thriving communities, LA County needs new affordable housing. As part of the solution, Many Mansions is utilizing innovative approaches to build more housing that reduce the length of the development timeline while simplifying complex finance mechanisms.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "In Los Angeles, there is a shortage of land to build housing. However, houses of worship present special opportunities to address the crisis through new strategies to develop housing on underutilized land. As part of an aggressive strategy to expand the supply of affordable housing in the County, Many Mansions seeks funding to advance YIGBY, a key growth initiative within this emerging real-estate and social services landscape. Flipping the script on NIMBY (Not in My Backyard), YIGBY (Yes In God's Back Yard) is a creative approach to affordable housing that is gaining acceptance nationwide. As an early adopter of this approach, Many Mansions will pilot YIGBY at the La Canada United Methodist Church where we have been selected to build 30-50 units of affordable housing on their excess land. Collaboration is the hallmark of our growth and will continue to drive our expansion. Many Mansions has over 10 partners on our pipeline projects, such as other nonprofit developers and school districts (including LAUSD). An LA2050 grant would help Many Mansions to pilot our YIGBY initiative and share key learning with other nonprofits on this exciting development avenue. In addition to reducing the housing shortfall, YIGBY has the potential to decrease land costs and mitigate other risks, increase organizational sustainability by diversifying funding sources, and quicken the pace of predevelopment-allowing us to house and serve more Angelinos in a shorter period of time.",

Many Mansions' long-term growth plan is strategic, ambitious, and guided by the highest performance standards. Targeted outcomes over the next few years include: -\tIncreasing usage of underutilized land for affordable housing -\tReducing predevelopment costs due to YIGBY and other innovative approaches (from $550,000 through entitlement approvals to $300,000 on average) -\tExpanding the number of non-traditional funding sources secured -\tDecreasing the length of time in preconstruction phase (from 36 to 24 months on average)"

First, we will organize public housing residents to participate directly in Housing Authority of the City of LA (HACLA) investments in redeveloping public housing. HACLA is currently planning to redevelop William Mead Homes, a 415-family community in Chinatown. Organizing residents at William Mead and other public housing sites, we will ensure that HACLA's massive investments in redeveloping housing result in increased affordable housing, matched with services and amenities, with deep community buy-in that previous HACLA redevelopments have lacked. Second, we will organize people who are unhoused or living in transitional or permanent supportive housing to work with the LA Homeless Services Authority to improve case management, security and other policies that currently make programs like Inside Safe inefficient, and demoralize community support for future programs.

It's essential to give this crisis the full attention and resources it demands, and we believe people who are directly experiencing housing insecurity are the greatest untapped human resource we have to contribute to solving this crisi. Angelenos consistently list housing and homelessness as priority #1, (as it was for the LA2050 Grants Challenge). There is no shortage of energy and willingness to work toward a solution. However, despite devoting resources to housing and homelessness programs, these programs seem to fail or are ineffective.

We also know from our own experience organizing in LA since 1999 that there is a gap between passing new policies, and implementing those initiatives. Local government agencies struggle to actually implement the policies communities want, and they often try to do so alone, facing opposition from special interests who don't want them to succeed. The people this hurts the most, and the people who have the hardest time participating in policy implementation are low-income housing insecure Angelenos, who are overwhelmingly people of color. We believe organizing that is focused on putting those most directly impacted at the center of policy design and implementation will make programs better and more effective, and restore faith in our collectively ability to face complex challenges like the housing crisis.",

We close out the program with a musical performance with Tia Leah's Neighborhood, led by co-founder Leah Gallegos for students and staff focused on celebrating the end of the program and reiterating the topics learned throughout the week. We will provide classroom and family resources such as bilingual Spanish/English posters and a deck of cards with the techniques and strategies from our curriculum that were covered over the week so that students and faculty can return to them as teaching tools throughout the school year. The curriculum is focused on: A basic understanding of yoga foundations Social and emotional skills: self and spatial awareness, focus and stress management Culture, identity, storytelling and well being Coping techniques for conflict and challenges Opportunities for fun, playful and creative movement Body awareness and self expression Leadership skills, self esteem and confidence Take home tools to manage emotions",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "PY implemented HSIP 2021 in the form of year around and weekly programming at two different schools. Qualitatively, we received feedback from staff of the benefits HSIP has on the children. Students are using the breathing and movement techniques in the school yard and in the classroom to manage their emotions, stress and conflict. Students across all ages have shared terminology, exercises and understanding of the strategies and techniques they learned. Our end of program survey resulted in 99% of K-2nd graders self-reporting that they were more Happy or Calm after participating. From the same group, 94% reported they have skills to handle their emotions and stress, while 63% said their favorite part of class was Resting and 47% said Meditating. The 3rd-6th graders had a 40% decrease in feelings of Stress, 40% increase in Calm and 33% increase in Relaxation. With the LA2050 Grant, we will work with Evaluation Experts to help us refine our surveys to better measure our impact."

Most people want to age in the homes and neighborhoods they love. Sadly, many older adults end up alone, invisible to the outside world. Many do not want to be a burden to others, and eventually most experience mobility issues, vision/hearing/memory loss, and illnesses which limit their access to vital services and connections when needed most. WPV provides a cost-effective way for seniors and their families to benefit from the following, most of which are provided by volunteers from the same community: door-through-door, arm-in-arm transportation that is safe and reliable; assistance with picking up prescriptions, grocery shopping, running other errands; taking trash bins to the curb and back, chores/handywork in and around the house; friendly visits, walking buddies, regular social support calls to help ensure isolated seniors have vital social connections to others; assistance/training to use technology (iPads, email, virtual meeting platforms) to provide opportunities for engagement with others and lifelong learning; access to a variety of social/educational/health/wellness programs; referrals to trusted resources in the community such as caregiving agencies, legal/financial advisors, medical/health providers and other professionals.

WPV is committed to, and its success depends upon strengthening communities by bringing together as many residents as possible, of all ages, to support its oldest residents. Thus, it is not just older residents who benefit. Instead, WPV is an intergenerational organization that is mutually beneficial to all involved, young and old. Younger residents learn the value of respecting their elders and giving back to those who came before them, and through WPV they often learn and hear important and valuable life lessons. Older adults and recipients of WPV services can also give back by mentoring a young person, leading an activity, sharing their expertise, making phone calls to another older adult. It is a win-win for all involved and an example that should be established throughout the county.",

The CDA reports that in LA County alone, the age 60 and over population will increase by 171.3% between 2010 and 2060, and by 597.0% for those age 85 and older! Most older adults want to age in their homes/communities, many have or will develop chronic health issues such as diabetes, hypertension and depression, and most live on fixed incomes with limited resources. Initiatives like Age Friendly Cities, Livable Communities, Purposeful Aging, and CA's Master Plan for Aging focus on addressing the many issues the aging population faces, and while these are positive signs, only .13% (or $16.58 mil.) of LA City's $13+ billion 2024 budget is for aging. We are ALL aging and will need help one day. Why are we waiting to prepare for our future?"

Many students in Los Angeles County struggle with purchasing hygiene products, like deodorant, we want to establish a hygiene locker program.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Approximately, in 2022, 70,000 people were considered homeless in the Los Angeles County. In the same year, there was a 9 % increase of homeless young people under the age of 18. The funding will help increase the current percentage of homeless people living on the streets gain access to showers. Since we participate in a large amount of outreach, we would provide showers alongside the hygiene kits we provide. The funding will help reduce the current percentage of homeless youth needing shelter. We would be able to provide housing and hygiene to the homeless youth. This would be two problems being addressed at once. We would also tackle the issue of students struggling to have hygiene. We would speak to the school district to see how we can distribute hygiene to the students. At a Juneteenth event, this past Sunday, we spoke to a high school student about providing hygiene inside of schools for students. She explained that it would be a great idea because some students can't afford tampons, shower gel, or even deodorant. She ended the conversation by saying, she knew these students personally, sadly, they are bullied for having an odor. Although we want to address shelter insecurity for the homeless youth, we are really dedicated to solving the hygiene insecurity issue. Out of 1000 nonprofit organizations, 5 focuses primarily on donating hygiene products. This is why we focus on hygiene; we have watched organizations place a shoe on a person's foot, the foot was infected.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Currently, for the program days we have in place, we use surveys to measure its impact. For example, when participants receive hygiene at the events, we ask questions pertaining to is hygiene important and if they are unhoused, for how long. When participating in outreach, we ask questions like race, name, and how long have they been homeless. Similar to 211, we created our own resource list, we place this list inside the hygiene kits. We provide resources about food, shelter, hygiene, and clothing. This way the person can call use if they need more hygiene, they could also call other organizations for additional help. We also placed ourselves on a hygiene locator, we use another form to track how many people we are serving and how often. We ask for the client's case manager to provide what hygiene they need, how often, and the client's contact information on a particular form we created. For the new programs, we started asking the community are the programs needed.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Pilot or new project, program, or initiative",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Hygiene insecurity is neglected when being compared to shelter and food insecurity. We have had the elderly, adults, teenagers, and children express the challenges they have experienced because of hygiene cost. Parents have cried because they didn't feel comfortable to attend an interview because they have not showered in weeks. The elderly expressed gratitude because they received oral hygiene from us, they didn't brush their teeth in months. A teenager informed us that they didn't have access to clean underwear in 6 months. This is why hygiene insecurity needs to be addressed now, poor hygiene leads to more deaths or viruses being spread, let's eliminate this issue! In a recent survey, we asked 35 people, should hygiene be provided to students for free? Each person answered yes. We also asked 35 people, would a mobile shower truck be beneficial for the unhoused population, again, they answered yes. Poor individuals can't focus on buying hygiene because they have to buy food instead.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Not only would an increase of people want to be clean, but the youth would also be more susceptible to succeed. LEARN can only be significant if we start helping the youth now. In a previous question, I stated that if we help the youth when they are younger, they will not become an older person living or dying on the streets. Our success for each project would be illustrated by more students feeling comfortable to state they need hygiene. More young adults will be prepared to face the challenges of adulthood, they would know how to be responsible, paying their bills on time. They would know how to budget, they would learn how to build generational wealth, they would understand the importance of investing. Throughout LA County, we have only seen 2 organizations providing mobile shower access. Adding this new program for us would have a great impact because we serve more than one area. For instance, we donate in Culver City, Watts, Compton, San Pedro, Torrance, etc., we travel.",

However, our pool of dozens of dedicated volunteers is able to fill some of the gaps left in the city and county initiatives to combat homelessness by performing direct outreach to unhoused neighbors, building meaningful relationships, and helping them access existing services and programs. Originally a chapter of SELAH, in 2022 NENO became an independent 501(c)3 and is now the only direct outreach non-profit organization operating in the NE area of LA City (primarily the neighborhoods of Eagle Rock & Highland Park). NENO's weekly operations includes providing a bag of food to people on a \"route\", fulfilling requests for material items such as tents and harm-reduction supplies, and offering to connect people to programs that are available, such as Tiny Homes. On a less frequent basis, NENO hosts outreach events where mobile showers, charging stations, a beauty salon, and other services are available. These events have the ability to reach people beyond our normal \"routes\" and offer a wider array of services. They are also ideal points for people to connect directly with city and county resources.

To measure our success for the planned (expanded) programming, we will tabulate the number of participants for each event, as well as the frequency each service was utilized. We also track and will report the supplies purchased with our funding and distributed to participants. We will continue to track our route participants. With city and/or county cooperation, we can also tabulate the number of people who are eventually placed into housing.

Through both our outreach and the direct service events, we hope make the experience of being unhoused in NELA less brutal and traumatic, and ideally to provide our participants with a pathway to housing through our advocacy. Through our emphasis on relationship building and trust, we believe we are uniquely equipped to help connect people with the services they actually need, and to advocate on their behalf.
