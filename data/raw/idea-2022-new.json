    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Food for Life program brings together professionals who create a trauma-informed setting in which participants--many with co-occurring disorders- engage in nature-based therapy, yoga, and meditation. The classes focus on nature study, exercise, body-mind connection and movement, mindfulness meditation, nutrition, and diet education. The core competencies of the program include nature-based therapy, trauma-informed activities, and holistic self-care, led by a bi-lingual staff member and a staff member with a background in Horticultural Therapy, guided by a Clinical Psychologist. Food for Life is set against the backdrop of GrowGood's various farm-based programs. This program is often a person's first introduction to GrowGood. Once a group of participants enrolls in Food for Life, they begin their weekly classes as a step towards self-care and healing. The trauma-informed setting becomes a safe space to address co-occurring disorders. Most participants also benefit from the meals from the fresh produce supplies from GrowGood to the shelter kitchen.

In addition to battling the challenges of substance addiction, mental health issues, and the risk of incarceration, the participants are often termed as \"hard to employ\". They lack access to fresh food and green spaces and affordable housing. GrowGood is located in the city of Bell--a \"food desert\", according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture--adjacent to the Salvation Army Bell Shelter. Food deserts are described as geographic areas where residents' access to affordable, healthy food options is restricted or non-existent due to the lack of grocery stores and farmers' markets within a convenient distance.

Setting up entry-level positions that are equitably compensated will allow for a more diverse workforce and encourage other institutions to similarly step up to the plate. Los Angeles is already a major destination for arts and culture, and individuals hoping to join the city’s dynamic creative industries graduate from college or relocate to LA everyday. However, the support systems for these hopeful talents are few and far between, and too often do not provide the mentorship or financial support that a fellowship like the Emerging Curators Program, or an internship, like the Apprentice Program, should provide.

We propose a pilot program based on successes of the last 8 years, to deepen mentorship around growing interest in the field of art curation, and to support 3 activities: an annual symposium, a mentorship program, with special attention to building a pipeline of BIPOC curators, and an exhibition for a selected proposal. Expanding the Apprenticeship Program: With over 800 participants to date, the Program develops a diverse pipeline of cultural workers. A pillar of the organization’s ethos since its 1978 inception, the program serves as a launchpad for many arts professionals to develop critical skills such as: administration, finance, development, research, communications, exhibition + event production, and facility operations. Apprentices are given unique projects to gain the skills necessary to flourish in their desired field within the art world.

Educational goals may be perceived as misaligned with a future students want to inhabit. Researchers report that almost 70% of students feel bored in school and 60% do not see value in what they are learning. In this environment, civic engagement itself can seem anachronistic. In contrast, project-driven learning crosses the barriers of academic disciplines to develop real-world solutions to the problems we face.

Roughly 40% of food is wasted in the US, and schools are a large source of this waste. When we educate students and faculty about how to reduce food waste it has tremendous impacts that reach beyond Archer and out into the surrounding community, comprised of mostly student families. Alongside the issue of food waste is that of climate anxiety. It is no secret that students are facing more mental and emotional stress now than at any other time in history. Climate Anxiety is especially prevalent among today's youth, and providing a garden as a sanctuary for students looking for a respite from the usual school rigors helps with their mental and emotional well-being. At the center of our communities are our children, and a burden so heavy as the fear of a dying planet casts a long shadow.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The program at Archer address the above issues in multiple ways. First, we provide in-depth curriculum around climate as it relates to agriculture, food justice, sustainable practices for growing food, and beneficial native plants. We, in partnership with the Sustainable Sciences department at Archer, maintain a constant focus on improving the girls’ proficiency in all areas of STEAM education. Classes are taught 3-4 days per week in the garden and also provide students and teachers with an “outdoor learning lab” that can be used at any time during school hours. Looking forward, we want to also address financial literacy by guiding the students through a student-led community farm stand. This is done by having the students grow, cultivate, harvest, and then sell the produce to the local community. The grant will help us grow this program to include more students and faculty and extend beyond Archer into other schools. We have also decreased food waste at Archer by composting cafeteria food waste for use in the garden, and we seek to expand this program's capacity to divert as much food waste as possible.

According to the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, “Black Medi-Cal enrollees use managed care plan mental health services at a much lower rate than White enrollees. Latinx & Asian/Pacific Islander Medi-Cal enrollees access mental health services at the lowest rates of all racial & ethnic groups in both managed care plans and county specialty mental health plans. Asian/Pacific Islander, & Latinx enrollees are less likely than enrollees from other racial and ethnic groups to receive five or more mental health services from managed care plans or county specialty mental health plans.” The biggest barriers to receiving help are time, cost, & limited access to resources.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Giveaways By offering chances to put mental health resources directly in the hands of consumers through quarterly giveaways, YNF seeks to empower individuals who do not have the ability or financial resources to obtain self-help publications or helpful tools that assist them with working towards an improved mental health state & overall quality of life. Music Therapy Workshops Two free music therapy workshops for 20-30 Los Angeles County residents. In a safe, group therapy setting, a certified music therapist will lead participants in a group therapy session accompanied by the opportunity to express thoughts, feelings, & emotions through art, poetry, or songwriting. Additionally, two mental health professionals/influencers (TBD) will serve as guest speakers who encourage & empower those who attend. Therapy Vouchers Providing 100% of the cost of 15-20 therapy/counseling sessions for 3 eligible applicants per quarter. In order to ensure funds provided are not misused or mishandled, YNF will have voucher winners/clinicians send the session invoice with session info & notes removed or redacted (HIPAA) to YNF for verification and payment. Additionally, we will have people include or contact us with the next session date in order to have funds ready for the next appointment. This process will provide payment directly to providers or practices, whether individuals have insurance or not or whether providers accept insurance or not, removing network limitations for recipients.",

You may have noticed by looking at the website and social media profiles that the tagline for YNF is “Using Stories of Survival to Save Lives.” That is because YNF is always open to giving people the opportunity to share their stories and testimonies (both openly and anonymously) of overcoming or living through mental health diagnoses and moments of crisis and distress. Additionally, feedback received from those directly impacted by this project will allow You’re Not Finished to serve individuals to the highest capacity possible. When individuals express that the therapy or counseling received has led to positive mindset or behavior change and potentially leads to a continued effort to seek personal counseling after the financial provision period expires, that will be considered a success for You’re Not Finished.",

For nine out of 12 months of the year, YNF will be actively putting tools in the hands of giveaway winners and assisting mental health professionals in guiding individuals to better health and/or positive behavior change (if not both, where applicable). Additionally, through the music therapy workshop, individuals will learn safe coping skills to be able to practice on their own and share with their sphere of influence.

Our classes focus on the production process from start to finish, teaching composition, engineering, mixing, recording, and other intricacies of digital music production. Many of our students are aspiring musicians who can no longer attend or have lost their band classes. This program helps these students to continue collaborating and expanding their skills. The Afterschool (virtual) Music Program was introduced to 28 students as an afterschool program at SoLA, a South LA nonprofit, 2 hours once a week for 5 weeks, and to 36 students at Locke High School in Watts, integrated into their one hour/weekly advanced band class.

In time with more students honing their musical interests, we may see more students of color pursuing higher music education to produce a broader definition of music in which communities around the world can feel a part. And, more of our students will find a pathway into the music industry which will start to shift the racial/ethnic balance of power either from within or outside. Artists will retrieve their masters which are routinely stolen by major-labels as a condition of their contracts. Executives will be held accountable for their behavior.

Throughout, there were experiments in tempo and loops, while others used their computers as instruments, playing notes with the keys and creating melodies and chords for their compositions. A zoom class using cloud-based music software accessible through students' Chromebooks, our desired outcome was for each student to use an audio sample and create an effect chain with the software provided. Our hope was that each student, starting with the same sample, would create a unique result. In the Social Emotional Learning component of the class, using emotional cue cards, we discussed the healing properties of music and how to write your emotions into a melody to express feelings.

TPL’s work delivers multiple benefits related to health, environment, community, inspiration, and economy. We help transform abandoned lots into inviting recreational spaces, asphalt-covered schoolyards into verdant campuses, and neglected alleys into vibrant greenways. We begin by using GIS-mapping and other research to site parks in the most vulnerable neighborhoods. We empower residents to choose themes and amenities, and create public art, so that the spaces represent local needs and cultures while deepening residents' connecting to these places and to each other. We partner with landscape architecture firms to translate local input into design documents. During construction, we coordinate with construction managers to keep projects running on time and budget. We organize volunteer groups to keep up the parks and the solidarity.

Low-income communities have much less park space and fewer quality parks than more affluent ones. These inequities lead to broader disparities in health, poverty, pollution, and crime. As park space per capita decreases, premature mortality from cardiovascular disease and diabetes and prevalence of childhood obesity increases. These same communities have suffered disproportionately from sickness, death, layoffs, evictions, and other hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic. Latinos and poor residents died at three times the rate of white/affluent residents. The lopsided impact of COVID-19 has made inequalities in Los Angeles even worse. Pervasive heat and smog also present health risks, like heat stroke, asthma, which are expected to worsen with climate change. Poor communities withstand the worst of these impacts due to a lack of green spaces to mitigate environmental and climate threats.",

This increase in parks and green space will support community engagement and connection though socializing, recreation, and civic engagement. New and improved green spaces will support ecological health, climate resilience, and environmental appreciation and literacy. Parks will encourage people to exercise, play, and relax. Greenery will create refreshing and beautiful environments that alleviate stress and threats of extreme heat and pollution. Residents will create mosaics and murals for their parks, deepening their sense of place and ownership. They will continue to share their heritage with neighbors after the park opens, on stages, amphitheaters, and other platforms. Parks will create opportunities for training and employing at-risk youth in landscaping and construction, opening the way for green careers and increasing economic outcomes across the community."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "It is our goal throughout this project to identify barriers that fathers face on a daily basis, create a safe space for fathers within the education system, and provide educational resources for fathers to support their child’s academic development. D.A.D Project programs are designed to support the domains of the Parent, Family and Community Engagement Framework (PFCE) outlined by the Department of Head Start for children ages 0-5. Considering, the bases of our approach steeped in the Head Start model, we provide skills to all fathers, parents and positive male role models to be better prepared for school readiness. We focus on STEAM, Literacy, building appropriate social skills, educational system navigation, and resource connection as vital parts to connecting family to community. Parents are encouraged to attend strength-based parenting programs that run concurrent with their child’s local school district. Parents will attend Man Cave workshops, School Readiness Events, D.A.D ‘s Day Outs, and Community Resource Distribution to develop skills necessary to support their children academic, cognitive and physical development. Our programs have proven to meet the needs of the community by addressing issues related to fatherless homes, childhood obesity, and child development learning outcomes. Success looks like families being more prepared to help their child navigate their learning journey.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "South LA",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "D.A.D PROJECT is a recognized leader in strengthening the ability of fathers and male role models to effectively engage with their children’s academic development. It is proven that providing safe spaces where fathers can share and strengthen their own parenting styles has a direct effect on the following parent and child outcomes listed below. Parent Outcomes - Families are safe, healthy, have opportunities for educational advancement and economic mobility. -Parents and families observe, guide, promote, and participate in the everyday learning of their children at home, at school, and in their communities. -Parents and families form connections with peers, mentors, and other community members through formal or informal social networks. Child Outcomes -Engaged in positive parent child relationships -provide critical thinking and problem-solving opportunities. -create a safe space for fathers and children to learn together. -children are ready for school",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We are currently collaborating with First 5 LA, Montebello Unified School District, PBS SoCal and many other community based organizations in Los Angeles County. Program success is measured based on feedback from parents provided by program evaluations. Our programs are evidence based where we utilize a combination of 24/7 Dad along with our own topics of discussion identified in previous parent interest survey. Evaluation Data/Documentation Used to Determine Program Outcomes: Program Evaluations- Upon completion of each program participants are required to provide feedback on their personal experience for each workshop. Program success are measured by attendance, and outcomes of each evaluation. Program Summaries- An in-depth summary composed on an outline of the goals and objectives of each program along with a summary of the activities and child development outcomes."

They have a role to play, but so do we. HERE IS THE MAGIC People want to help There are nonprofits and other groups which need volunteers on so many levels virtual, in-person and in-kind donations yet there is no organization really acting as the bridge between the helpers and the volunteer opportunities. Databases are too passive. Someone has to ask DIRECTLY for people to help. When that is done, and the task is easy, and it has impact, and it is happening in the coming week people say yes If it sounds too simple, that's because we have not done it well to date Volunteer Collective has been 'challenging' folks to volunteer do one thing, each month, and in our first two years thousands of people stepped up.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "If you accept the premise that asking people to help is all that is required, then the formula is so simple Ask more people. The modest grant we ask for is basically for outreach. The Volunteers the nonprofits serving our most needy citizens need are in churches and synagogues, they are students who are required to do community service, they are employees of businesses who are increasingly trying to be better community partners and retain employees by offering time off to volunteer. All of these groups, and the residents of LA in general, are hungry to hear about opportunities to do something for someone else. We all know how good it feels to help others. Maybe that national debate over mental health is solvable if everyone did a little to help a neighbor. And before you dismiss this as a bit too Utopian, please tell me why a program of asking for help, which can be done on a very small budget, is not worth a try? And also ask yourself, when someone last asked you to help someone you did not know. My bet is you can't even remember when it ever occurred. And we are hear to tell you it works."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "A recent study found that over a third of young adults with autism, 34.1 percent, chose a STEM major in college compared with 22.8% for the general student population. This significant difference between the two rates indicates the strong affinity for and interest in STEM that autistic students have. However, fewer than 40% of students on the autism spectrum enroll in college compared to 75% of high school students generally. This shows the degree to which an interested and capable sector of the population is being underserved and overlooked at the very time that the United States generally is very short of qualified STEM employees. The current shortfall in computer programming, for example, is estimated to be 1 million jobs unfilled. Our goal is to ensure that all of our neurodivergent students have the education and experience in STEM to enable them to stand side-by-side with their neurotypical peers in applying to college or in seeking a career.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "STEM^3 Academy has, as part of its K-12 curriculum, classes in Engineering and Design, Robotics and Computer Programming. We maintain Innovation Labs for the high, middle and elementary schools, a space where they develop and build projects and test out ideas. The Labs include a wide variety of tools and machines including a CNC Mill, an X-carve, drill press, band saw, 3-D printers, virtual reality platforms and much more. After having been largely inactive over the last couple of years due to COVID, much of our robotics and engineering educational and competition resources need to be upgraded to the latest generation of hardware and software.",

We will provide workshops and integrate newer technologies and newer versions of existing technologies into the curriculum. Our students routinely engage in competition in Robotics and Engineering challenges. They have taken first place in a coding challenge at Raytheon against 25 schools in the southland, and 3rd place at Northrop in a challenge to build a trebuchet. Their ability to compete and be competitive is essential to their self-confidence and provides opportunities to collaborate and communicate with their neurotypical peers. Having them stand not only as an example of what neurodivergent students can accomplish, but how they can be successful in the broader society, is of inestimable value to our County.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "One metric of the success of the program is the number and quality of colleges that our students are accepted to. We have students attending UC Irvine, UC Berkeley, a number at UC Davis, the University of Chicago, and many other two-year and four-year colleges. Our courses are authorized as satisfying the A-G requirements for admission to a 4-year college, and in addition we offer a variety of classes at the AP level as a foretaste of what college will be like. This was not always so. In the decade and a half that I have worked with capable autistic students, I have seen a shift in their general motivation as a result of higher expectations on our part, and a more appropriate STEM curriculum which is both engaging to them and provides them opportunity for success. A second metric is how they have thrived in Robotics, computer programming and classes in digital arts, drone technology, 3-D printing and virtual reality."

After a successful pilot in the 21/22 school year, Turnaround Arts: California is seeking to expand our Lesson Labs program with 5 of our partner schools in LA County. Through Lesson Labs, teachers are paired with a teaching artist to design, implement, and evaluate lesson plans that align core standards in subjects like math and science with arts standards. For example, teachers can use dance to help students understand the oxygen cycle, or use visual arts to teach key math concepts. By teaching with and through the arts, teachers create rigorous lessons that meet standards and also make learning more accessible for students (i.e. those learning English as a second language or those who struggle with reading and writing). Lesson Labs are an exciting addition to Turnaround Arts: California’s work and hold great potential to disrupt traditional inequitable school structures and teacher professional development models. Lesson Labs put teachers in the driver's seat to create arts-rich and culturally responsive curricular experiences that benefit all students. Moreover, through Lesson Labs teachers learn strategies they can regularly replicate across classrooms, for impact across growing numbers of students.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA County is the nation’s creative capital, yet most students here don’t have access to the arts. Lesson Labs help change this. By empowering teachers, we create a ripple effect of positive change classroom by classroom and across the school, for the benefit of LA County’s students. Teachers will have opportunities to come together and exchange around their work. This supports further innovation in support of students across LA County. Lessons created through the program will also be formalized and made available to schools in our statewide network. We also take advantage of the rich creative landscape in LA. We leverage and uplift the expertise of local arts orgs and artists (such as P.S. ARTS and Budding Artists) and partner with them to bring their diverse expertise to our schools. This “collective impact” approach means we are able to make real progress to move forward a new vision for public education and arts access across LA County and California.",

One teacher noted: “Lesson Labs allowed me to develop a creative unit on a content area that I teach every year, but is often difficult for students to grasp the concepts. Through this work, I was able to develop a unit that was engaging and relevant.” We realized we had created a model with potential for deep impact across the teaching profession, and are excited to build upon this work in the year ahead. In the coming year, we will evaluate Lesson Labs’ impact via (1) Mid-year and year-end teacher reports with qualitative & quantitative data; (2) Regular communication throughout the process on progress and areas for support; (3) Quarterly meetings with teaching artists re progress and areas for support; and (4) Creation of a shared teacher framework for assessing student learning.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Students need the arts to support their learning, develop social emotional skills, & become critical thinkers & engaged citizens. Research shows the benefits of arts education but decades of narrowed scripted curriculum & budget cuts have eliminated the arts from many children’s lives and disempowered teachers from innovating their lessons to incorporate the arts. LA County public school students in historically marginalized communities - students of color, those who qualify for free/reduced priced meals, English language learners - are consistently denied access to the arts-rich education available to their more affluent peers. Reports show this lack of arts education harms teachers’ ability to engage & motivate students (leading to high drop-out rates), deprives students from developing 21st century skills i.e. problem solving, critical and creative thinking (limiting their employability), & diminishes the likelihood of engaged adult citizens. This is an issue of basic equity."

What if there was an accessible and transparent solution that civilians could use to submit a complaint that would help prevent incidents like this from occurring again? Oversight is that solution. There is no national database for Police complaints, but more than 1.2M people in the U.S. either experienced or were threatened with the use of force by an officer according to a 2018 Department of Justice survey.

Our customers include the City of Philadelphia (PA), City of Charlottesville (VA), and Suffolk County (NY). A sample use case is when a community member attends a protest and has a negative experience with a Police officer. The community member will visit the customer’s website and click a link that takes them to Oversight. The community member then submits their complaint, the customer manages it until it closes, and the community member receives updates along the way.

Land to develop affordable and permanent supportive housing is hard to find and expensive. Layering and scarcity of funding create a slow and expensive process to develop affordable housing. To succeed in a competitive public funding environment, affordable housing projects must keep the per-unit cost within a comparable range to projects across the city. It is nearly impossible to build permanent low-income housing in areas that are richest in resources that would make the transition to permanent homes most successful for low-income people. A 2019 LA City Planning Department report revealed that of the affordable units permitted in the last 10 years, 14% were produced in the City’s High Resource areas, while 62% were in the Low Resource, High Segregation & Poverty areas.

Program implementation will start by recruiting and training 30 parent community leaders on Climate Truthing in schools. Climate Truthing is setting a criteria that acknowledges climate disparities and informing the community on truth. Trained parents would survey schools collecting data on how schools are/are not addressing climate change effects on their students’ health and wellbeing. Data findings would influence a case study/policy report set to grow development of green space and infrastructures on campuses. Developing parent leaders who can advocate on the necessity of green spaces and the connections to health benefits contributes to this program’s uniqueness in addition to increasing community oversight on city and county spending. Additionally, our program will join existing environmental coalitions furthering the holistic lens necessary to address climate change. SFV and South LA were chosen to ensure available public funding is equitably allocated to greening schools and to help address various health issues our students are facing. The impacts of increasing green infrastructure on campuses would improve the learning environment for students with health conditions, address learning loss which has been heightened due to COVID-19, and improve the working environments for faculty and classified employees.",

In the immediate, we would see a positive investment in green spaces and other key environmental resources for our communities to support both mental and emotional wellbeing. Long-term, ABC will activate elements of the Latino/a Scorecard Report aligned to green space. A policy recommendation is the creation of healthy environments in the SFV and South LA areas to promote more livable communities with access to more green spaces.

The YLA – and Workforce Development Program, in particular – will help them overcome feelings of “failure” and envision a future in which they are a valued and an important part of the community. 2)\tLocal businesses that are in need of skilled workers will have a new pipeline of entry-level employees with the foundational training necessary to be effective, long-term assets to the corporation. L.A. County will experience a financial boost. Helping students at high risk of dropout to complete high school and find a path to economic security will alleviate the $392,000 each high school dropout costs the state of California (California Dropout Research Project, 2007) while providing local companies the workforce they need to thrive."

In LA, 85% of water is imported from sources straining for supply as climate aridification increases. Drought is intensifying. Tree canopy and access to green, natural and wild spaces are deeply inequitable. Ecosystems are damaged by climate change and fragmented by urbanization. Residential, commercial, and municipal gardens are key sites to protect, enhance, and future-proof our local urban environment. A well-designed garden will decrease water use, enhance wellbeing, rebuild ecosystems, increase shade, reduce urban heat island effect, sequester carbon, and uplift neighborhoods. Climate-resilient gardening - lawn replacement, rainwater capture, soil regeneration, and appropriate plant selections - can and will regenerate LA. People need to learn how to garden this way. We’re ready to teach them.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our pilot will teach people how to design, build and maintain climate-resilient gardens to help safeguard LA’s climate future. We’ll create training opportunities for three cohorts: residents with access to a yard, landscaping professionals, and youth from under-served communities building careers in the environmental sector. Our classroom will be Arlington Garden - a thriving 3-acre public garden. We were a vacant lot for over 40 years, meant to be the staging ground for the 710 freeway. For 17 years now, we’ve been redressing environmental injustice. Arlington thrives on 90,000 gallons of water a month, just 56% of Pasadena’s average consumption. We’ll liaise with our network of community partners to build innovative curricula and attract diverse participants. Professional and amateur gardeners will apply transformative climate-resilient practices where they live and work. Stipends will be paid to participants, in line with our priority of access for people from under-served communities. Until now, too many Angelenos have gardened in spite of our climate: water-hungry lawns, unsuitable plant palettes, excessive fire risk, and a lack of appreciation for the signature features of a Southern California garden. The Climate-Resilient Gardeners Program will road-test a new, and much-needed, educational strategy, inspiring and transforming at least 63 acres of private, public, and commercial gardens into places that safeguard our climate future, rather than jeopardize it.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our primary program goal is for all enrollees to graduate as skilled and influential climate-resilience gardeners. We will measure progress through staff check-ins, and mid-and-end-of-program surveys. Mentor outreach will calibrate the training to be responsive to student needs, making it more likely that they will excel in the program. The surveys will give us valuable qualitative information about the curriculum to inform future iterations. This program is about paradigm shifts. We define success as trainee engagement and them having the confidence to influence others.The curriculum will include change-making, and we will stay in contact with participants upon completion. Within the months of graduation, all members of the cohort will be invited back to the Garden and paid to teach a workshop related to their work in the landscape or environmental sector. We will check-in with participants and track their success in climate-resilient gardening at 6-month, and 1-and 2-year intervals."

Students become better at problem-solving, working as a team, and have enriched creativity with better focus in school. Being in our program gives youth a chance to be a part of something bigger in an uplifting environment with a place to belong. They get to be the example for their peers and others who have behavioral issues and resort to the \"street life\" and show them what's possible when they have a healthy outlet to express themselves. We evaluate our work with start and end surveys, journal evaluations, interviews and direct feedback from school staff and teachers.

Of the nearly 30,000 children in LA’s foster care system, the majority live in poverty, and over 80% are Black or Latinx. The trauma they have experienced – through no fault of their own – increases the likelihood of learning and behavioral problems. This often results in poor academic outcomes for these youth; California’s foster youth have a 56% graduation rate compared to 85% of all students. In LA, half of youth who age out of foster care end up homeless or incarcerated. Moreover, the systems designed to serve these children and youth are complex, challenging to navigate, historically replete with bias, and not well connected, forcing youth to confront the same types of problems over and over as they try to maneuver through the systems. The pandemic has only exacerbated these challenges.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "In early 2021, the Alliance convened a summit of caregivers, parents, youth, educators, social workers, and other stakeholders to envision policy reforms to promote racial equity in our child welfare system. After subsequent discussions, in July 2021 we published recommendations to address racial injustice in the system in our report, The Path to Racial Equity in Child Welfare: Valuing Family and Community. We then launched the Whole Families/Whole Communities initiative. To advance this initiative and with support of this grant, we plan to develop a Reform Council, composed of youth, parents, and caregivers to integrate their lived experiences and perspectives into advocacy for change. The members will work with local and state agencies to drive policies that promote racial justice in the systems they experienced. Led by our Policy program team, we will launch the Reform Council comprised initially of at least two youth (ages 18-24), two parents, and two caregivers. Council members will be trained on strategic storytelling, public speaking, and the rights of youth in foster care. They then will work with program leaders to craft their own experiences into stories to help advance a more just, equitable, and supportive system. Once trained, Reform Council members will make presentations at conferences, convenings, and legislative hearings to influence leaders with the power to make decisions or suggestions for improving policy and practice."

Through this project, we can ensure that LA County will be informed one what changes might make the biggest difference in the lives of young people who are systems involved – from the experts who should be leading systems change. In the short term, our work will ensure there are a number of advocates with the tools and expertise to share their perspectives effectively. The website will also present a place where youth can go to be heard as well as connect with one another to feel less alone in their experiences of these systems. In the long term, this work will lead to better operating systems that previously have led to a lot of negative outcomes.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Beyond training youth to lead the conversation, we plan to provide career enrichment opportunities for youth. We will host at least one contributor in LA County in our 2023 cohort (which is a 3-4 month curriculum) and one intern who will assist with administration and outreach. We plan to work with at least 40 youth and publish at least 20 stories from young people on key child welfare issues. We have measured how many youth we work with as well as how often youth reengage with the program more than once. Lastly, we will partner with local nonprofits to make a plan for a website that will host Youth Voice creative writing, journalism and opportunities. This will require putting out an RFP for a site and building out a plan for securing funding and MOUs that will be piloted with LA County partners. Progress in this will be measured by having a final document that outlines the partnership, site development contract, and how we can move forward with partners.",

Frequently, youth interact with multiple systems and are less likely to have success in college or career attainment. These negative outcomes also disproportionately impact youth of color, who are overrepresented in these systems. In late 2021, LA County brought together its Youth Commission. Its stated vision is “All youth-serving systems in Los Angeles County will be informed by, and co-designed with the voices of youth with lived experience.” Unlike many other commissions, this Youth Commission has real power – they can audit county budgets, directly communicate with supervisors, and meet in front of a group of decision makers monthly. This grant would come at a critical moment for how LA County is listening to youth voices. We want to use our program to elevate youth voices that will improve the system.",

Youth Voice started in 2016 in LA County. We host training workshops, do one-on-one editing, provide opportunities for internships and fellowships in journalism and connect youth with writing opportunities. In February 2022, FMC Youth Voice did a training with the LA County Youth Commission on how to write an op-ed. We know this is a critical time to empower youth with lived experience to share their perspectives, because more people are listening than ever before. At least 7 youth are going to publish stories in The Imprint on policy issues from that workshop. FMC provides youth with the tools they need to discuss what policies and changes they would like to see. We provide them the skills and resources to train other youth in using their voice as advocates, to produce events where youth or experts share their opinions, and to use their interviewing or writing skills to ensure leaders are on-the-record. This project will continue that work while securing proposals for a website that will host all creative writing, photography, essays and journalism produced by youth writers. We hope to pilot this site with LA County partners and use this grant to build out a site development plan – as well as what other resources will be available on the site.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "SCFM mediators give parents a voice with pre-disposition-hearing mediations. Our volunteers are specially trained to hear through the vitriol to the cries for help. Through mediation, parents get a voice in what the charges will be and negotiating the language of the \"Petition\", which determines their \"family reunification\" (FR) Plan. The language can mean the difference between unaffordable private therapy and affordable group counseling. During their 2-year journey, some co-parenting relationships are so high-conflict that a judge, social worker, and the four attorneys (for parents, kids & county) can’t make visitation happen. Our mediators are often called in to help parents create their own agreements through day-long “agreement-creation workshops”. Adversarial court systems shatter family relationships. Mediation avoids the violence suffered by families who leave the system with “Exit Orders” reading, “Parents will agree to a visitation schedule.” Self-determined co-parenting plan agreements are customized, detailed, and durable. We keep young parents, and later, their kids from returning to this growing system. More funding means more families served. Also, due to the success of our processes & education strategies, the Court has requested that we secure our own funding to create a “Conflict Communication Education” system for families in the system.

In our nearly 2-years of operation, we have completed 99 Skid Row Drops. We plan to use LA 2050 funds to support 26 weeks of water operations. Each week we distribute 1700 gallons of water, 1,296 bottles of electrolytes, and 84 bulk boxes of soft foods for between 720 and 850 people. This model of distribution overcomes barriers to access by providing water to any resident within the bounds of our program, where they are, and with no strings attached. Our consistency within the community has allowed our core team and volunteers to develop strong, trusting relationships with community members who often assist in our weekly distributions. A second core component of Water Drop LA’s model is our partner water program. We provide water to underresourced organizations to support their efforts serving low-income and unhoused communities. This allows us to support residents across LA County and to partner with organizations that know their specific communities’ needs better than we do. Beyond bringing these essential resources to combat water insecurity, we are planning to expand the needs our volunteers are equipped to address.

They stated that otherwise they would need to rely on unclean sources such as fire hydrants, or simply go without. Since our founding, we have worked with more than 50 mutual aid groups and non-profits. In FY 2021-22, we donated water to roughly 15 organizations on a monthly basis. Through these partnerships, we have donated 21,760 gallons of water in total. Lastly, a large part of what we consider success is how many housed members of the community we are able to engage. Since 2020, we have welcomed 847 volunteers who have contributed 13,500+ volunteer hours. 62% of our volunteers have returned to volunteer after their first drop.",

Water provision for unhoused residents has been exacerbated by COVID-19 as essential services have been significantly reduced, and public water infrastructure has been shut off or poorly maintained. In Skid Row, most residents have unclean or irregular water access at best. They must purchase overpriced water from liquor stores, tap fire hydrants, or rely on broken drinking fountains. There is roughly 1 drinking fountain for every 520 unhoused residents living in Skid Row, all of which are clogged or broken. These issues are made worse by the lack of tree cover and asphalt making Skid Row an “urban heat island.” High heat coupled with a lack of clean water results in frequent cases of dehydration, heat stroke, and even death.",

While our work in the short term focuses on bringing urgent aid and resources to Skid Row, we hope our long-term advocacy efforts will lead to public water infrastructure that guarantees water access even without water distributions. We expect our community building, empowerment, and training efforts to lead to a movement of action-oriented individuals who are equipped to act to address issues in their communities. Many of our volunteers volunteer repeatedly, and some have gone on to create their own non-profit organizations after identifying unmet needs while doing water drops."

Nearly 66% of the population of South & East LA have less than a high school diploma, & 94% have less than a bachelor's degree, with 56% of 16–19-year-olds having neither a job nor a high school diploma. In addition to high youth unemployment, adult unemployment is significantly higher in South LA when compared to the rest of LA. Our neighborhoods consistently lack access to affordable, art-making activities, let alone materials for creative expression or instruction. Literary programs, specifically, are rarely offered to bilingual or linguistically isolated communities in the community’s native language, ultimately disenfranchising & gatekeeping our community from inclusion in the Arts; as an industry & as a whole.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2022",
    "organization": "LA Family Housing",
    "summary": "There are more people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County than ever before, yet there is simply not enough affordable housing to stem the tide--particularly studios and one-bedroom units. LA Family Housing launched an innovative web-based platform that efficiently and effectively matches potential housemates for shared housing. Generating housing matches at a much larger scale than an individual case worker can, this pilot program moves more people facing homelessness into stable, affordable homes across Los Angeles.",
    "goal": "LIVE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Pilot or new project, program, or initiative",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In the first phase of the pilot, we introduced AROYO to three key partners in the region, which more than doubled our client input. We newly entered 114 clients into the program and successfully matched and housed at least a dozen individuals. As we scale up these efforts in the next phase of the pilot, we expect this 11% match rate to exponentially increase. The more data in AROYO, the more potential for successful matches. Simultaneously, we are working to train more case workers in AROYO, improve public perception of shared housing, and incentivize landlords to increase shared housing properties. Success will be measured by the number of clients input into AROYO, number of successful matches, and number of people housed, as well as client satisfaction and improvements in data measured through the county-wide Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), such as the Vulnerability Index-Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) scores and housing retention.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "San Fernando Valley",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "At a time when affordable housing is unprecedentedly inaccessible, shared housing—when two or more unrelated people split the cost of rent and live together under separate leases—is an effective tactic to move more people out of homelessness and into stable housing. Thoughtfully and successfully matching potential housemates up to this point has not been easy, requiring cumbersome manual analysis from case workers and constant cross-agency coordination. LAFH created a web-based tool, A Room of Your Own (AROYO), used by providers across the county to advance shared housing and help move more people off the streets. Participants and case workers fill out a questionnaire online about their lifestyle and housemate preferences to better understand their housing needs. A carefully constructed algorithm matches participants who are experiencing homelessness with viable housemate candidates, and service providers work with them to identify multi-bedroom units. In the next phase of this project, we will improve the application with a new web developer, Strategic Platforms, Inc. to hone match functionality and expand AROYO across more service providers, increasing the number of potential housemates in the system. We will build out our capacity through hiring Shared Housing Coordinators to facilitate meetings between matches and handle more clients at once, as well as Shared Housing Locators to increase the properties available for shared housing as AROYO increases matches.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 275",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In Los Angeles County, a dearth of affordable housing options combined with rising inflation and the economic fallout from COVID-19, decades of disinvestment in our social safety net, and the continued effects of systemic racism are causing more people than ever to fall into homelessness. In 2020 even before the pandemic, 66,433 people were experiencing homelessness in LA County on any given night. The limited housing stock that is available is unaffordable for lower-income communities. A 2021 report revealed that the Fair Market Rent for a one-bedroom apartment in California is $1,615. To afford rent and utilities at this level, a renter earning minimum wage would need to work 2.2 full-time jobs. Historically, people with housing vouchers seek to secure a one-bedroom or studio unit. Across the country, the severe shortage of one-bedroom and studio units is made worse in large cities like Los Angeles where competition for available units prevents voucher-holders from being considered.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Amid a housing shortage in L.A. County, shared housing is both a short- and long-term solution. By capitalizing on the existing stock of multi-bedroom housing units in the region, we can not only avoid lengthy construction timelines and provide more immediate housing for more people experiencing homelessness, but also lower their cost of living. Beyond the cost savings and ability to move multiple people into housing at one time, shared housing can have extraordinary social, mental, and emotional benefits and can be a pathway to independent living for people transitioning out of homelessness. In effective shared housing programs across the country, more than 85% of clients placed in shared housing experience long-term success, according to the Shared Housing Institute. By advancing shared housing across L.A. County, AROYO will help improve some of the most pressing issues currently facing Angelenos and exacerbated by the pandemic: homelessness, mental health and financial insecurity."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our team currently organizes with approximately 2,500 street vendors in 24 vendor hubs across LA County. 70% of the vendors we work with are women and the main breadwinners in their family. Through this organizing experience, we’ve learned that an enforcement-heavy strategy does not result in compliance and only burdens poor working families with more fees. A different model must be developed in order to attain successful implementation. With the support of this grant, we will continue to disseminate important information on vending regulations and organizing efforts to all 24 hubs throughout the region. We will have a particular focus in 4 vendor hubs where we plan to build a model of self-organization that will lead to improved compliance with legal vending programs and mitigation of issues with other stakeholders. This model will include supporting vendor hubs in identifying and developing leadership, specially among women; developing community vending agreements; developing structures for self-governance and mutual aid; connecting vendors to hands-on technical assistance programs; and developing a network of vending leaders across all 4 hubs that can respond to displacement efforts and advocate and organize for improvements to the city's street vending program.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "City of Los Angeles",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Although LA legalized street vending in 2019, investment in the infrastructure to support vendors has not arrived. Of the 50,000 vendors in LA, approximately 2,000 have obtained their permits to sell legally. The city has wasted resources investing millions on enforcement agents who lack cultural competency to lead “outreach and education” efforts, and therefore, the implementation of this program has not reached its full potential. Moreover, vendors in popular vending hubs, such as the Guatemalan Night Market, are often faced with threats of displacement under the guise of health and safety. The majority of vendors are women and senior and they find themselves in dire economic distress when displaced form their work. As we enter the recovery phase of this pandemic, we are seeing a re-emergence of street vending and a growing number of women taking on this work. We must protect these entrepreneurs from criminalization and displacement and supports their economic stability.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If our work is successful, street vendors across the LA region will be better informed about their rights, about LA City’s street vending program regulations, and they will be better equipped to navigate permitting processes. Popular vending hubs will be self organized through community agreements which will promote safe and walkable streets and opportunity for all street vendors. Hub leadership will work and mediate with other stakeholders in the community to address any issues pertaining to street vending and there will be no need to involve enforcement agencies. Women will turn to vending as an opportunity for economic growth and they will feel safe and supported. These hubs will serve as models for how to successfully onboard street vendors onto the city’s program. The City will invest in the development of other self-governing street vending hubs and in the sustainability of these economic enclaves. The City's legal vending program will reflect the real needs of vendors.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our team has successfully implemented a version of this project in 3 hubs. In 2020, we worked with 40 vendors at Expo Park to elect a leadership committee, create agreements on vending locations, and as a united front, negotiate with Expo Park management. This resulted in an agreement that vendors are allowed to continue vending, even though areas of the park are deemed no-vending zones by the city’s rules and regulations. Expo Park management directly contacts vendor leaders when issues arise before dispatching enforcement agents. At the Guatemalan Night Market and the weekend market on Main Street in South Central, which host approximately 100 vendors each, we've supported vendor leaders in mediating issues among themselves and with other stakeholders such as brick and mortar businesses and churches. Community agreements have resulted in less interaction with law enforcement, a better relationship with the local council office, and mitigation of displacement."

Many of the military families we come across in Los Angeles County have young children that have become angry and resentful adults. Military families have been separated since the Vietnam War, and many Post 9/11 War heroes have the same issue with child custody being belittled and/or ignored. Our goal is to equip each individual involved with the tools and resources to create memories and bonds between the child and the separated parent through family fun events to keep the bonds evolving to live a heartfelt and fulfilling life."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The program addresses the whole child from classroom instruction to wrap-around services. Prior to lessons, each 3rd grade student (including those with disabilities) receives a Water Safety & Nutrition Workbook to review with their teacher, RBAC instructor, and families. This workbook is an interactive tool to learn water safety principles and prepare for in-water instruction. This student session concludes with an opportunity for families to ask questions. Then, students travel to the RBAC weekly for the in-water portion of the program which typically occurs during their designated PE class time. Equipment and swim suits are often a barrier to aquatic participation so students receive a swimsuit, googles, and towel to keep as their own. Over the course of 3-4 weeks, fifteen 45-minute swim lessons (over 11 hours of instruction) to overcome the fear of water and acquire beginner-level swimming skills. Students will participate in lessons to learn life-protecting water safety behaviors and progress through the seven levels of swim skills. Swim instructors use equipment including paddle boards, teaching platforms, dive toys, and flexible \"noodles\" to support instruction. Students complete their workbooks that reinforce lessons learned after each lesson. The program ends with a family picnic to celebrate the student’s achievement and to create a sense of belonging. To continue this relationship, the students are offered free swim passes to return to the RBAC with their family.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our vision is to prevent childhood drowning and equitable access to aquatics. Learning to swim saves lives, yet, 66% of Asian Americans, 64% of African Americans, and 45% of Hispanic/Latinx have no or low swimming ability. These communities need direct intervention and to experience a sense of belonging at pools, rivers, and the ocean. This program strives to help children overcome the fear of water and build self-confidence in their aquatic abilities. The specific goals of the program include student demonstration of at least eight ways to be water safe and those frightened of the water will overcome that fear. Other goals include gaining sufficient skills to move up in skill levels and to be able to dive from the edge of the pool and/or attempt jumps from a diving board. An important outcome is also that families will visit the RBAC using the Family Swim Pass provided and participants will report that they can participate as a member of an aquatic team in the future if they desire.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Drowning is preventable through educational intervention. According to the CDC, for children ages 1–14, drowning is the 2nd leading cause of unintentional death. Learning to swim saves lives, but access to critical water safety education has too many barriers. There is not equal access to water safety instruction and aquatic facilities. Learning to swim is not a given for most children as many don't have access to backyard pools or private clubs. 79% of children from families earning less than $50,000 per year tend to have low to no swimming ability. All except one PUSD school is a Title 1 school (i.e., families earning less than $50,000 annually) so chances are this is the only exposure a student may have to become water safe. According to the American Red Cross if a child doesn't learn to swim by the 3rd grade, they likely never will. The 3rd-grade water safety program has educated over 25,000 children with hands-on experience learning to swim and critical life-saving skills.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The impact of the program is measured by quantitative data (e.g., attendance records, pre- and post-test results, and completion of Water Safety/Nutrition Workbooks) and qualitative data such as reports from classroom teachers and anecdotal stories from families. Pre-tests indicate that 80% of third-grade students in PUSD do not know how to swim. The post-test and program results include: • 80% of students have perfect attendance • 99% of students who were extremely fearful in the pretest overcome their fear • 95% of students gain sufficient skills to move up at least one swim skill level with 75% moving up at least two levels • 80% of students are able to dive from the edge of the pool and/or jump from a diving board • 75% of students are able to participate in beginning water polo • 100% of students complete a program evaluation • 30% of families revisit the RBAC using the Family Swim Pass • 80% report that they have the ability to participate as a member of an aquatic team",

They’ll receive an annual salary of $30,000 to work 30 hours per week for 1 year. They will work closely with various staff members and DJs at the organization, learning everything from station management and communications, grant writing, and events production, to show development and technical skills. Each Apprentice will have the opportunity to gain a wide variety of knowledge, while also honing one or two specific skills of their choosing so that they leave with professional experience and technical expertise, as well as strong recommendations. The goal of the program is to offer a robust early professional experience that will set participants on a path for success within the audio, music, internet radio, and/or podcast industries.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "With this program, Dublab is envisioning a robust future for radio, music, and audio that is reflective of the incredible diversity of LA County. We see a creative industry that offers opportunities for young people to make a living, while getting their foot in the door and gaining the skills and networks that they will need to build a sustainable creative career. While this grant would support the first pilot run of the program, we can already see the potential for rippling impact of mentorship, diverse networks, and opportunity that will reach many more people, by simply offering robust apprenticeships to a few excellent candidates.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Through this apprenticeship program, Dublab is working to address the lack of professional opportunity and gatekeeping that can often happen in creative industries. It can be incredibly challenging for young people without connections to gain entry level jobs, necessary skills, or a professional network that will support their future working in audio, music, radio or broadcasting. We are especially interested in working with youth from historically marginalized backgrounds, as they are more deeply impacted by these issues of access, and also bear a more challenging financial burden that may deter them from accessing these skills through expensive courses, or unpaid internships. We see this program as addressing issues of diversity within the audio, music, radio, and broadcasting professions. This program has the potential to create clear and committed pathways for those from historically marginalized backgrounds to build exciting creative and professional careers in audio.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This grant would support the initial pilot year of this program. In the first year, success would be defined as Dublab setting up an application and acceptance process, onboarding two apprentices. We would develop a robust and impactful syllabus with hands on opportunities, skill development, mentorship, and opportunities to meet professionals in the field, creatives, and work closely with Dublab staff. We would solicit feedback from the first year apprentices, honing the program with consistent improvement overtime. Additionally, we envision success as being able to fundraise for this program ongoingly, however this opportunity to pilot with LA 2050 would surely be a significant catalyst in our ability to do that."

Our mission is to advocate for and create equitable access to nature and healthy school environments that support: safe outdoor education, physical and mental health, social and emotional wellbeing, and climate resilience for students and communities. The connection between lack of access to nature and health is stark. Less access correlates with higher rates of childhood obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The LA County DPH’s 2016 Parks Report states access to green space has many individual and public health benefits, including lower rates of childhood obesity, lower self-reported stress, lower rates of crime, and improved air and water quality. These benefits are critical to the development of children and their families.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Green schoolyards create nature-based outdoor spaces to turn heat-absorbing asphalt into cooling, living ecosystems. They help close equity gaps in access to healthy, experiential learning environments. They help students feel less stressed and more focused, and mitigate the effects of climate change. When implemented across an entire school district green schoolyards can remedy historic inequities in environmental justices and public health while helping to build climate-resilience. It’s time to bring what is working in Oakland— and what has already been proven with long-term successes in places like New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas—to Los Angeles. This isn’t a luxury that we are proposing, this is a critical response to environmental and health conditions that our students face everyday. The Los Angeles Living Schoolyards Coalition is committed to helping transform every school site into nature-filled environments that support students’ health and well-being while also creating more open spaces for the community on weekends. The LSYC is working to: 1.\tMake it easier to transform and access schoolyards through a transparent and streamlined application and permitting process; 2.\tFast-track creating healthy, living schoolyards in neighborhoods that lack access to local public parks; and 3.\tOpen schoolyards as public parks to serve communities during non-school hours.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "It is well known that the existence of trees, parks and natural systems in communities correlates with race and income. When implemented across an entire school district, metropolitan region, or county, green schoolyards can remedy historic inequities in environmental conditions, public health, and climate-resilience. Our vision and intended impact is to leverage the power of green schoolyards to address issues of environmental justice, climate justice, and educational equity. The LA Living Schoolyards Coalition is working to: •\tIdentify a clear path to opening and greening schools across LAUSD to make it easier to transform asphalt-covered schoolyards into vibrant, green spaces, with natural play structures, and outdoor classrooms that are unlocked for public use after school hours to help provide park access for the 1.5 million Angelenos who lack it; and • To create comprehensive greening and joint-use at all LAUSD schools, starting with those in the highest need communities.",

Craft brewers spend capital on obtaining grains to produce their products. It has been demonstrated that bread retains much of the proteins, fiber, and taste from the original grain it was made from, and therefore can be used as a raw material for producing beer. There has been some success in collaborations between bakeries and breweries in Europe and other parts of the United States; we would like to establish a program which will allow participating breweries and commercial bakeries in Southern California to work together to reduce bread waste, allow the brewers to operate in a more cost-efficient manner, and contribute to a healthy environment through recycling and upcycling.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Realistically, I can see 25-30% of local brewers taking advantage of this program once or twice a year. Some may choose to do it more often, while others may try it and feel that it's not worth their time and effort. However, if we do see that level of participation, it will appeal to other breweries and bakeries across the county. In addition, the lessons learned and principles developed in this initiative can be applied to other food upcycling ventures in other food product chains.",

However, many gaps and inequalities hamper this effort: poorly resourced schools in low-income areas struggle to provide even basic STEM education; women and people of color remain underrepresented in STEM fields; the digital divide persists; and girls tend to lose interest in STEM subjects and careers as adolescents. A 2018 Pew Research Center study found that most Americans felt that STEM education in K-12 public schools is average compared to other developed nations. Some 53% attributed this to teachers not emphasizing the practical use of STEM subjects; some 49% believed that teachers rarely used methods to help students think critically and problem solve.",

Gaps related to STEM education are most acutely felt in poorly resourced public schools and underserved communities, and girls often fall the farthest behind. Moreover, the school closures and transition to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic have hit poorly resourced schools and low-income children the hardest, amplifying existing disparities.

The program is geared toward project-based learning, where students are given a real-world problem on which they have to work collaboratively, using an interdisciplinary approach. This requires not only use of hard skills (i.e. product development and management, user design, research, marketing, etc.) but also soft skills (i.e. communication, teamwork, problem solving, critical thinking and the like) and connecting the dots between multiple subjects. Our mantra is “STEM is everywhere” and reaches across all job sectors and industries. The “B” in “B~STEM” stands for business. Our programs are built on the precepts of business and technology. This causes students to think from ideation through development cultivating skills that they otherwise would not have gained. We take students out of their classrooms and neighborhoods, and into workplaces so that they can visualize a future as a professional. We also provide students with guidance and mentoring from professionals to whom they ultimately present their project and receive real-time feedback and assessment.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "B-STEM consolidates its programmatic core (combining business and STEM across industries in a creative and empowering way), in partnership with leading companies across LA county. Our programs focus on exposure, creating awareness and providing unique experiences. All students need to experience the world of work, particularly work of the future, long before they leave school. B~STEM connects the world of learning to work through our project-based learning experiences. Schools alone cannot be expected to foster the complex combinations of STEM, digital and transferable skills, like collaboration, problem solving and communication, that students will need in their future careers. That’s in addition to core skills like literacy and numeracy. Bringing together the classroom and the workplace has broad public benefits, but can be challenging to do in practice.

LA is a major hub for film, TV, and live event production, yet there is a huge diverse, local population that isn’t aware of the increased career opportunities available in this field. Film school can be expensive and exclusive; not everyone with the passion and work ethic required for the entertainment industry is able to attend a typical 4-year university film program. Many of these individuals don’t know that there are so many more careers available to them in the behind-the-scenes world of Hollywood than just screenwriter, director, and producer, and could benefit from training in the “below-the-line” crafts of the industry such as stagehand, set dresser, grip, camera loader, costume finisher, set lighting technician, or set painter.",

Hollywood CPR has been diversifying the entertainment industry since its earliest days. Our founder, Kevin Considine was inspired by his personal experience with the arts as a form of empowerment when traditional school did not lend itself to his form of learning.

Classes are led by active union professionals who offer rigorous hands-on training in the crafts; and through our program, students can also receive actual on-set experience through traineeships on productions at major studios. Hollywood CPR is unique in that it is the only training organization with an agreement with both the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) – the union that represents the technicians and tradespeople within the entertainment industry; and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) – the employers within the entertainment industry. Because of these partnerships, students in the Hollywood CPR program not only gain the technical skills required for these crew jobs but Hollywood CPR also gives them a clear pathway to union membership. The program addresses the industry-identified problem of assuring a supply of diverse, union-trained craft workers to fill new openings via our outreach efforts to historically underrepresented groups. Hollywood CPR recruits from LAUSD high schools, community organizations, and entities such as LA’s foster care system, the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, and others to ensure that those with an interest in entertainment aren’t overlooked no matter where they come from.",

Compared to other major cities in the US, LA has the lowest number of community darkrooms, with only two accessible to the public for community use- School of Light and Contact. BIC co-founder Samone Kidane turned to the Contact darkroom after the Santa Monica College darkroom shut down during the COVID 19 pandemic. Contact Photo Lab, the cheaper of the two, brands itself as “the last community darkroom in Los Angeles,” and it costs $300 for a two hour mandatory workshop that grants photographers access to the darkroom facilities. Having a range of accessible, community darkrooms is key to the life of a city’s creative community, especially when our local community college darkrooms are closing. By holding space for people to cultivate photography and storytelling skills, we are reminding our community that we know exactly who we are.",

For too long, the stories of Black people have been portrayed through the lens of non-Black image-makers. We are working towards a shift in this dynamic, the construction of a functional darkroom is one milestone of success toward this vision. The BIC Community Darkroom alleviates financial barriers by providing affordable darkroom time, along with addressing the issue around the ownership of Black narratives by supplying tools and space for Black people to be in control.

By investing in Black creativity, the entire city will benefit. Our short term goals are building the darkroom infrastructure and building up our base of vetted people who can operate and work within our darkroom. We plan on having mandatory courses to familiarize folks with our darkoom that will result in a membership card for darkroom access.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "If awarded, the LA 2050 grant would support the physical buildout for the Black Image Center Community Darkroom and the development of inclusive, educational programming in collaboration with Las Fotos Project. Black Image Center already currently has a brick and mortar space, and we are seeking funds to create a functional, accessible darkroom. Our darkroom will be outfitted with at least two enlarger stations and host classes where 5-7 people at a time can learn how to develop both color and black and white film, and create their own darkroom prints. This is important because most community darkrooms across the board are exclusively for developing black and white film. In addition to funding the construction and materials for BIC's darkroom, funds will also support the collaboration between BIC and Las Fotos Project to create a shared curriculum for free programming as well as the development of a business plan which would establish shared pricing models, policies and training for both of our darkrooms, further ensuring that Black and Brown creatives have accessible options, regardless of of their geographic location. Operational costs include wages for darkroom attendants, Teaching Artists, and BIC and LFP staff. The goal of the BIC Community Darkroom is that its creation will allow people to take our classes and walk away with a strong foundational knowledge of both black and white and color darkroom photography."

Each LEEAF Leader joins a strong community with years of follow-on support not only to achieve individual success but to pursue the goal we share: making LA County a model of economic inclusion and equity for all. To this end, LEEAF equips Leaders not only to gain financial investments but also to break low expectations and model new roles community-wide. LEEAF works with banks and investors to bridge networks, shift policies, and create new resource flows to change the landscape of entrepreneurship.

Decades of disinvestment left communities of color without access to the basic resources to build wealth, leaving entrepreneurs struggling to attract the resources and support to thrive. BIPOC women have the talent and work ethic for broad economic leadership - 47% of businesses started by women since the pandemic are owned by BIPOC women - but significant obstacles stand in their way. 61% of businesses founded by Black women are self-funded and only 3% of mature businesses are run by Black women. Loan denial rates for small business owners of color are 3x higher than those of white owners, 42% to 16%. BIPOC women business leaders in South and East LA have the talent and drive to be engines of growth and wealth creation for families and communities but face financial, social, and personal barriers to achieving their dreams. LEEAF unites leaders to break these barriers, building equity one entrepreneur at a time.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Measuring and optimizing impact is at the core of LEEAF's model. To date LEEAF Leaders have accessed over $4M dollars in capital, preserved 116 jobs and accessed over 1000 hours of technical training and 1:1 support. To build on this impact, Cal State LA faculty leverage expertise in qualitative and quantitative analysis to lead a dynamic evaluation system that captures economic impact in real time, tabulating weekly interviews with each cohort member to create an accurate, rapid portrait of personal and business growth for each small business in the cohort. This rapid evaluation system feeds into broadly published reports that assess program effects on revenue and job creation along with case studies highlighting the entrepreneurs in the cohort. In these reports, faculty track key indicators of job creation, capital access, business health, and personal wellness along with rigorous causal analysis that identifies the most effective elements of the program model.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The LA2050 grant will enable LEEAF to equip 50 women of color business leaders as economic catalysts and community hubs through: 1) a 12-month intensive technical assistance program with training, advising, and access to capital that will promote growth, resiliency, and change; 2) 8 months of human capital from a vetted and trained Cal State LA Student Fellow; and 3) years of additional resources, funding, and networking as part of an active LEEAF alumni network of 150+ leaders. LEEAF’s unique capacity to deliver outcomes for business leaders comes from a program and leadership team that balances complementary strengths - practical expertise in business fundamentals, talent development, interpersonal empowerment, and academic expertise - to build inclusive economic systems at the grassroots level. We leverage the resources of program partners including the LA SBDC Network, local chambers of commerce, CDFIs, and specialty training partners to fuel the growth of underserved women entrepreneurs, amplified by the full backing of Cal State LA. In parallel with the direct program work, LEEAF conducts evaluation, research and public relations campaigns to inform the replication of similar programming, provide insights into the impact of women of color entrepreneurs, and ultimately to shift narratives around gender and race in entrepreneurship.",

They are likely to improve their school attendance and consequently academic performance. A positive PK-12 education experience has the potential to be a powerful counterweight to the abuse, neglect, separation, impermanence and other barriers these vulnerable students experience. Additionally, participation in and persistence to a postsecondary credential can enhance their well-being, help them make more successful transitions to adulthood, and increase their chances for personal fulfillment and economic self-sufficiency.

Situations also arise wherein foster families are deemed unsuitable hosts and children must be swiftly removed from these settings. Due to the urgency that DCFS removes children from perilous situations, they often have nothing but the clothes on their back. Children in these dire situations are referred to FCRC by the DCFS for services. The plight of children under court and DCFS supervision can be difficult to imagine.

Each child is referred to FCRC by DCFS social workers. Foster families or caregivers arrive at pre-scheduled appointment times, ensuring that each visit is special and discrete. When children first enter FCRC they tend to be withdrawn and reticent having been traumatized by their current situation, so volunteers make every effort to treat each child with loving care, respect, and dignity. Volunteers act as personal shoppers and guide children through beautifully displayed items, allowing them to select and try on clothing. They are supplied with new school uniforms (depending on their age) and other contemporary street apparel, backpacks, school supplies, socks, shoes, underwear, jackets, pajamas, hygiene kits (including masks and hand sanitizer), and pillowcases or infant needs like diapers and blankets. Volunteers work thoughtfully with children who are fearful and wary of others. They make each child feel safe and welcome and are rewarded when they see expressions of sadness turn to joy.

Some examples: a homeless family of five living in a shelter came in and their a five year-old son only wanted a blanket because he was cold at night, then clutched it to his chest as his most prized possession; a foster mom who received a 4 month-old infant wearing nothing but a diaper was thrilled to receive blankets, clothing, diapers, formula etc.; a 4 year-old girl, in foster care for two weeks, had not spoken a word but began talking and laughing after her visit to FCRC; Dominic arrived at a new foster home with only the clothes on his back. Dominic, formerly Alexis, preferred boy's clothing. Both Dominic and new foster mom were more anxious as Dominic started menstruating.

In LA, most parks are concentrated in white and affluent neighborhoods, meaning people who live in low-income and majority-BIPOC neighborhoods are likely to live a 10+ minute walk from a park or green space. We also know that racialized violence is at historic highs in LA and across the nation, causing our Muslim, Japanese American, and BIPOC communities to feel unsafe in public spaces where they are likely to be targeted. VL’s “LAnd Solidarity” project seeks to address this issue to improve our community’s sense of safety and belonging, as well as resist social isolation created by Covid-19. Because of these factors, it’s increasingly important and urgent that our communities have space to gather and play outdoors; have the ability to explore the natural environment through the arts and outdoor programming; and build cross-communal solidarity in a supportive environment.",

Through the project, we especially plan to gather on the land in BIPOC-majority areas, such as the South LA Community Garden, the LA Worm Farm Collective in Northeast Los Angeles, Black Thumb Farm in Panorama City, El Sereno Community Garden, Seeds & Song in South LA, the Tuna Canyon Detention Station in the San Fernando Valley, and parks in Little Tokyo. Outdoor gatherings may include hikes, picnics, and land work/farm work as forms of creative play, and will be paired with programming about the history of the sites with a focus on indigenous and multi-ethnic histories, ecological histories, and histories of solidarity. Gatherings will include a creative component that encourages connection through activities like movement, zine-making, gardening, and more. During the research phase, we will host 5-10 listening sessions with up to 30 community members to connect about their desires and needs around land access and cross-communal solidarity, including program participants who have voiced this need already; reach out to at least 5 values-aligned community organizations to co-create a vision for this initiative; identify a minimum of 3-5 gathering sites; and organize 1-3 sample gatherings."

In CBP she also tours professional woodshops, lumber yards and design studios, building a professional network so that upon completion she is well positioned to join the LA craft industry. But CBP doesn’t end with the Artisans. Because they are building furniture for communal spaces at housing sites and service centers around LA, their creative work is appreciated daily by the community at large.

Coming out of 2+ years of COVID, these projects will also help combat heightened social isolation in LA. The pandemic has been particularly isolating for people experiencing homelessness, not only because of disproportionate health risks, but also because many services and public spaces shut down or reduced services. That’s why, more than ever, building safe and accessible outdoor gathering spaces for everyone in LA is vital to building back community engagement without compromising public health."

We are a group of five (5) community land trusts in Los Angeles. Each community land trust is directed by the residents that live there and the surrounding neighborhood.The five CLT’s are El Sereno, Trust South LA, Fideicomiso Tierra Libre, Beverly Vermont and Liberty. The LA-CLT coalition fundraises together, has a separate fincial account for shared funds, develops training and plans policy actions together. We are in the process of creating a coalition strategic plan, and long-term structure of the coalition. Each community land trust brings different specialties, such as tent & social justice organizing, stewarding properties, cooperative development, & environmental sustaibility.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Community Land Trusts creating housing cooperatives with working class residents of color would benefit Los Angeles County by preventing the displacement caused by gentrification, would serve as reparations for communities of color, provide multigenerational wealth-building through housing that neighborhoods have been denied, promote community ownership and serve as a homelessness prevention mechanism. Imagine LA County allowing for buildings to be owned by the residents that live there. Residents would no longer fear being displaced and feel an ownership of their neighborhood and its conditions because they have a stake in it. This allows low-income communities of color to create intergenerational wealth and re-stablizing communities that have been dis-invested.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 300",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The LA CLT Coalition and Community Development Corporation (CDC) partners are working collaboratively with eight buildings across the county to stabilize and rehabilitate 43-units without displacing anyone. The plan is to convert the buildings into a tenant ownership model and while the land trusts will own and steward the land below it. All five Community Land Trusts (CLTs) hold tenant meetings to include tenants in decision making about rehabilitation and build capacity in forming housing cooperatives. All eight buildings are majority Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) tenants and low income/very low-income families. We plan to use the $75,000 to implement comprehensive support and training in identifying criteria for plausible housing cooperative conversions at all five buildings. This will support tenants in identifying if their building is appropriate as a housing cooperative and consider other housing models more suitable for the residents and properties.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In 2019, while 207 people experiencing homelessness in LA County found housing each day, 227 people fell into homelessness. This imbalance in numbers is likely to continue unabated if “naturally occurring” affordable housing (NOAH)—properties that are currently unsubsidized and which do not have existing affordability covenants—remain at risk of being purchased on the private market and converted to higher-income rentals. LA County currently has 18,209 NOAH properties that provide more than 396,000 lower rent apartments for households earning 80% of AMI or lower. Even as the County seeks to build more affordable housing to meet their Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) goals, inadequate preservation of existing affordable housing will lead to “leaks” in the affordable housing system, hindering the effectiveness of affordable housing production.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "With the support of LA 2050, we will launch the County of LA Cooperative campaign. All 5 Community Land Trust will use their social media and other community engagement tools necessary to create and raise awareness around Cooperatives in LA. We will measure our impact by hosting four trainings. Two for residents in LA who are interested in learning more about housing cooperatives and two for tenants who currently live in buildings that are owned by the Community Land Trust. We will measure impact by tracking the number of working class residents of color that we engage with. We will also measure impact by tracking the number of tenants that we engage with that live in buildings that are owned by Community Land Trust. At the beginning and end of each training, we will have residents and tenants fill out pre and post surveys to see if they are gaining knowledge on housing cooperatives."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "According to the Poverty and Race Research Action Council Report from March 2018, 60% of students in PUSD qualify for free or reduced lunch. In order to qualify for these programs their family income must be less than $46,435/yr (for a family of 4). Recent data from the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment indicates that the zip codes 91103 and 91101 had the highest rates of children living in poverty in the service area (28.2% & 25.4%, respectively). PUSD iReady ELA Diagnostic Scores released for grades 1 - 5 for the school year '20-'21, show 62.82% of students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are below reading level for their grade. 72% of our current program participants fall into the Free and Reduced lunch category. After the Bell provides a safe and enriching learning environment for students who fall into those statistics. Power Talk is designed to challenge unhealthy belief systems and values. The classes are designed to be either intervention or prevention focused.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "For After the Bell, we are measuring success through registrations as well as pre and post test assessments. We collect report cards and we utilize PUSD iReady testing diagnostics as they become available from the parents. For Power Talk, we rely heavily on attendance records, pre/post test assessments from students as well as assessments from teachers and administrators that we partner with. Our Power Talk post-test assessments have revealed that when our kids are asked “What skill do you think you’re not good at?” Our students respond overwhelmingly: “School, Math, and Life”. According to our post-test assessment, 69% of our Power Talk students reported the following statements are now true about themselves: “I am more aware of how my thoughts affect me.”, “I have a stronger vision for my future.”, “I work harder in school.”",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "“After the Bell” is our After school program. ATB is founded on two guiding principles: scholarship and leadership. The ATB provides a culturally responsive curriculum that empowers scholastic improvement, character development, and intergenerational leadership. Our staff provides academic plans and pathways so that parents can help their students reach their goals. This program culminates in a Performing Arts showcase at the end of each season. Power Talk is a pull out class that our students attend during the school day. There, we discuss growth mindset, the power of affirmations, empathy, and leadership principles that will prepare them for real world scenarios. Our elementary classes are focused on preparing at-risk students to develop security in their identity that teaches them to make decisions that repel negative outside influences. Classes average 20 -30 students per session. At the middle school level our class is focused on intervention. Among students in the PUSD (grades 7, 9, and 11) in the academic year '17-'18, 14% reported being in a physical fight within the last 12 months, 11% had seen a weapon on campus, and 2% reported gang involvement (2019 Community Health Needs Assessment). Through relationships, we understand that our children are already under the power of negative influences. Our focus is to attack those systems that already influence the lives of our children. PT is laid out so that our students can learn how to weigh the cost of their choices.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Success for our program looks like our students increasing in their sense of self worth. There are very clear school to prison and school to gang pipelines in our community. We seek to create a space where our students can see that they are valuable and that their education is valuable in an attempt to interrupt those destructive pipelines. Our staff are specifically trained in Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) modalities. This holistic approach allows our program to care for our children and identifies challenges that may exist in their lives. We believe that SEL is helpful, but is maximized when applied through a culturally relevant lens. This is because students begin to disassociate their identity from academic spaces when they don’t see themselves represented in those spaces. Our goal is to expose our children to as many different disciplines, diverse leaders, and experiences to broaden their horizons and help them see how big the world is and that they have a valuable place in it."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In CA there is a critical need for early math intervention services. More than 1.5M CA families include infants and toddlers, but only 38% of eligible children are enrolled in preschool. In 2019, only 40% of CA’s K-12 students were proficient in math. The pandemic continues to increase these barriers to access. In 2021 the USC Rossier School of Education reported that achievement rates for underserved children had fallen by 10%. In Compton, one of FM’s partner communities, 68% of families identify as Latinx, 21% live below the poverty level, and young children too frequently fall behind. Fewer than 10% can count to 10 in preschool and ELL students often lack academic support in their native language. On average CUSD’s public elementary school ranking is 4/10 (bottom 50% CA schools) and math proficiency is 33% (vs. 41% statewide). FM’s family engagement program is an essential service for combatting these early learning barriers and ensuring success for LA’s most vulnerable children.",

FY22 evaluation findings after attending FM workshops and academies revealed: -75% of parents were more confident in their ability to have conversations that involve math while doing everyday activities with their child; -100% of parents had more positive feelings toward helping their child with math; and -75% of parents were more confident in their ability to support their child’s math skills at home. Participant testimonials also speak to program impact. One parent shared how: “I learned that mathematics can easily be kept in mind in daily life as when eating a cookie, when preparing a sandwich, or by looking at the shapes of our entire home. I had not thought of putting mathematics into practice that way.”",

FM’s evidence-based, direct-service model of engaging families in the learning of their young children has proven an effective approach to developing early math skills. Highlights from year-round FM services: - Introductory Workshops: 4-week series that helps parents gain confidence and create fun math experiences for their children. - Parent Academy: 5-week series that dives deeper into essential pre-K math concepts including sorting and collecting, number sense and counting, patterns, and shapes. - Family and Community Learning Workshops: 4-week series that brings parents and children together to engage in learning experiences that foster collaboration, communication, and problem-solving skills. - Digital Parent Academy: 5-part modular series that creates a self-paced learning experience for parents around early math concepts. - Events: FM Storytime, FM Night, Kids Camps, and more. - Digital and Physical Resources: culturally relevant articles, short videos, learning guides, monthly newsletter highlighting early math concepts, social media posts, take-home FM backpacks filled with books and items to facilitate at-home math learning, and more."

This first day connects youth with adults who share how relatable stories can look, sound, and feel. Second, we empower youth by telling them that they have a story that matters, planting a seed of confidence and affirming that everyone belongs and is valued. Next, we ask the group to establish community agreements and collectively define the space they need to showcase vulnerability and feel safe. Facilitators then direct them through our My Story Matters Journals, which won UCLA’s 2019 Social Enterprise Competition. These 100-page personal narrative guides are filled with prompts that help students identify the characters, settings, struggles, accomplishments, and lessons that comprise their stories. Through self-reflection activities and intentional dialogues, students build deeper connections with their peers through this process, helping them realize they are not alone. The program culminates in a community circle in which students are invited to share their stories, unapologetically owning who they are while learning about their classmates.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The hub will improve the food security, health and safety for thousands of unhoused and low-income community members in LA,many of whom already rely upon us for regular meals and services.This project will allow us to expand our capacity to provide meals and additional services to reduce or prevent homelessness, enabling us to reach many more underserved community members.Service providers in LA agree that the limited and decentralized resources for food, housing and health services would be improved by a community center that provides healthy meals in tandem with other services, has no barriers to access, and is open 7 days a week.We will create a more seamless integration between our meal program and social safety net programs, through measurable touchpoints.Participant records in our internal database will be used to track touchpoints and progress with accessing housing and health services.Our impact will strengthen the resiliency of our community, our food system and food security."

    "summary": "Coptic Educational Foundation (CEF) helps to open doors for immigrant, refugee, and first generation youth who have the potential to succeed both academically and professionally but whose socioeconomic status, immigration status, and/or cultural background creates a barrier to overcome. We achieve this by bridging the gap between education and these closed-off communities through culturally responsive and person-centered educational services for middle and high school, college, and vocational students who attend our partner churches.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "Describe the specific role of the partner organization(s) in the project, program, or initiative.": "Although we are not submitting a collaborative proposal, CEF partners with 7 churches across Los Angeles to conduct outreach. Our target population endures a 25% poverty rate; most members attend the churches CEF collaborates with. Each church is operated by clergy people who understand the unique circumstances of all of their regular parishioners and their families and serve as their advocates and liaisons to CEF. Our partnerships with these churches allow us to make the most direct outreach possible to a population who has been routinely overlooked and neglected by other nonprofits who are unfamiliar with the vastness of the educatiol are in the United States. These partnerships, combined with our lived experience, CEF is uniquely prepared to fill that gap of understanding.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "CEF’s target population for this program are immigrant, refugee, and first generation students who also attend our partner churches. These isolated communities are in desperate need of services, but the only way to reach them is to meet them where they are: church. About 500,000 of these individuals live in California; the majority live in Los Angeles. 23% of our target population lives below the federal poverty line; more than twice the average rate. Because they are so insular, this immigrant community is often unknown, unaccessed, and forgotten by many organizations and government agencies. And yet, many of the youth that we serve grow up to become successful and thriving adults. For example, our board member Mina Hanin came here in 2011 as a refugee from Egypt. Mina received a scholarship from CEF to attend UC Riverside. Now he is currently enrolled with a full scholarship in his master’s program at Harvard while simultaneously serving as a highly passionate CEF board member.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "CEF bridges the opportunity gap by connecting students who attend our affiliate churches to important resources, educating them about how to utilize those resources, supporting them through individual counseling scholarships and subsidies, and ultimately empowering them to break through the trap of poverty and become successful and contributing members of society. We offer a variety of comprehensive services, including college admission and personal statement writing workshops for high school students, as well as test prep, financial aid counseling, and merit-based scholarships. We offer graduate school workshops and career counseling for college students, subsidized vocational training, and college counseling for immigrant, refugee, asylee, and first generation students applying for college in the US. We also offer high school preparation for middle school students and resources for families requiring assistance with special needs education. Due to cultural or linguistic barriers, a great number of families who attend the churches we collaborate with are unsure of what resources to reach out to or who to ask for help in order to ensure better educational opportunities for their children. CEF is unique in that it is an institution that parishioners can trust. As the board, founders, and staff all have lived experience of its target population, CEF is sensitive to their cultural and linguistic needs, and can thus provide the most suitable resources needed for their success.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Crossroads links women released from prison to immediate stability. The six-month Residential Program provides comprehensive services. The Transitional Housing Program, available to any woman who completes a Residential Program provides another six-months. Women participate in weekly case management, individual counseling to cope with trauma, and group sessions to improve self-esteem, strength in sobriety, life skills, and well-being. Women are assisted in going to medical, dental, vision, and parole appointments. In the Turning Point Job-Readiness Project, the women write resumes, practice job interviews, learn to talk openly about interrupted work histories to prepare for finding employment with a felony record. When women start working, they save 75% of their earnings for eventual independent living. The Crossroads programming is evidence-based, gender-responsive, and trauma-informed. Crossroads hires staff with the shared experience of having been incarcerated. In addition to the daily engagement, the home environment is crucial to Crossroads. The women cook dinner and eat together every night in an effort to form a family-like dynamic. CA statistics show that 59% of women released from prison, return to prison within 3 years. If women stay at Crossroads for at least 3 months, over 90% graduate from Crossroads and become self-sufficient members of the community. Women rebuild their lives, and this significantly reduces recidivism and homelessness.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Homelessness in LA County is a crisis. Crossroads serves formerly incarcerated women and while prison provided a roof over the head, it is not a home. Women are negatively impacted and so is her family, extended family, neighborhood, and community. Women released from prison have multi-layered needs. In a Prison Policy Report, the formerly incarcerated were 10 times more likely to be homeless vs. the general public, and African American women were most at risk of homelessness. When a woman paroles, she is given $200. The characteristics common to female parolees - - severed social relationships, economic vulnerability, addiction, abuse - - increase the likelihood that women will become homeless and/or return to prison. Homelessness is more than not having a physical home, especially for vulnerable formerly incarcerated women. Homelessness can encompass hunger, isolation, fear, poverty, lack of opportunity, barriers to employment and stigma of having been incarcerated.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "At Crossroads, we believe in second chances. We also believe that women coming out of prison deserve kindness, hope, compassion, and practical assistance. Many of the women have served long prison sentences, many up to 20 years each. The goal of Crossroads is to create community for the women. Providing specific job-training for women also creates employment opportunities. When women work, they express that they feel just like everyone else. Working allows women to live independently. The barriers are real, but the women succeed every day. Crossroads helps to make LA County a more equitable community where our most vulnerable are given chances and are treated with compassion. As one Crossroads graduate said, “This program is not just a re-entry home, or a sober living place, it’s not just a life-changer, it’s a lifesaver. Crossroads showed me what real unconditional love feels like and I hadn’t ever experienced that before.”",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Over 90% of women complete the Crossroads program and continue to live independently in the community. Crossroads has a system the ensures each woman is attending classes, meeting personal and program goals, and completing the program. One of the benefits of being a small organization is that each of the staff members have a unique relationship with the women. The staff can offer additional support during crisis. Success looks different for each woman. For some, success is just walking in the door. For some, it is getting their first job in 20 years at McDonalds. For some, it is going on to higher education. Whatever the story entails, it is important that they know that each journey is unique. Crossroads helps each woman, but also helps the larger community because she is part of her family, network of friends, neighborhood, and work environment. A Crossroads woman is always welcome back if she needs any additional support. The Crossroads door is always open.",

These students receive a salary and housing benefits during the summer program, and chances to enhance their leadership and mentoring skills. Caregivers, educational rights holders, and social workers are also provided opportunities to strengthen partnerships and learn support practices for the college admission process.

Market-rate housing development is largely aimed at more upscale buyer demographics. The charitable sector wants to be engaged in this but there are few avenues for employing their resources to increase affordable housing stock. Apart from Habitat for Humanity, what charities are building privately-financed housing in Los Angeles? Very few, and because Habitat's model uses volunteers and (helpfully) targets larger households, it lacks the capacity to scale up to the extent needed. New methodologies must be found that allow charitable organizations to help with a crisis that few believe they have any capacity to address. YIGBY, in San Diego, is doing similar work, targeting church owned land. We think that our fast and cost-effective method for creating short-term housing affordability can engage churches and smaller nonprofits now, while at the same time opening up the opportunity for larger projects down the road.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "This program intends to show that much smaller housing can help reduce LA’s housing affordability woes. Just as tiny shelters have recently been used to rapidly and affordably expand the city’s shelter supply, movable tiny houses can be placed as backyard cottages, using ordinances already in place, within months at a fraction of the cost. LA City’s accessory dwelling unit ordinance makes it possible to legally permit movable tiny houses as ADUs, but has no provision to ensure that new ADUs are used as affordable housing. New ADUs can be offered at market rate or used as vacation rentals. Our 7 year long pilot program matches five single family residence owners with five program participants who either already own a tiny house. The homeowner agrees to rent the tiny house “pad” (a cute parking place with utility hookups installed) for $1 per month during a 12-18 month trial period and affordably after that, in exchange for a forgivable loan to cover construction and permitting costs. Program participants agree to reimburse the loan fund for the full amount of the hookup installation during the trial period, and then enjoy below-market housing costs for the remaining time. Sherman Oaks Presbyterian will use LA2050’s $75,000 award to establish a revolving loan fund that provides each homeowner with a loan. The project director will help the homeowners obtain contractor bids and apply for city permits.",

The City of Los Angeles’ most recent housing element, for example, calls for adding 61,000 new residential units per year, a goal some experts say is impossible. The City of LA has produced about 16,700 units annually since 2014. including only 1,650 affordable units per year. According to the Los Angeles Housing Services Authority, the County of Los Angeles has some 550,000 households that are severely at-risk of losing housing because they are paying more than they can afford. How will these affordable homes be built? Where will the money come from? No-one has satisfactorily answered those questions, but all agree on one thing: Los Angeles must reimagine its affordable housing production plans, because what we are doing now isn’t working.",

By the end of year 1 the program will have begun recovering loaned money and will be nearing the ability to fund a fifth tiny house pad from the revolving loan fund; 3. By the end of year 1, donors and grantors will have added $75,000 to the revolving loan fund; 4. By the end of year 1 five churches or other nonprofit organizations will have agreed to participate the program as impact investors by establishing an affordable housing endowment of at least $5,000."

The need for new generations of well-trained talented artists and creative workers is significant, yet due to decades of declines in arts education funding at the K-12 level, inequities in access to arts training in schools have continued to grow, often leaving talented students from under-resourced schools and neighborhoods far behind. This leaves many with the desire, drive, and talent to pursue an art form without the means and access to do so. We believe that comprehensive arts programs are not only essential, but vital to the complete development of all students and especially important in expanding career pathways and college readiness and success. Investment is needed in programs and arts high schools, like LACHSA, that can create equitable access to professional level arts training and can uplift young potential artists to see themselves in STEAM careers and as the culture makers of the future.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The LA County High School for the Arts (LACHSA) has been addressing the need for equitable access to artistic and creative training with our successful model of professional-level arts education in a public school setting. The LACHSA Foundation was specifically founded as a response to the decimation of arts education in California's public schools. Through its creation and support of LACHSA, free conservatory-style arts education has been provided, for decades, to diverse and talented young student artists who go on to top arts conservatories and colleges and ultimately into the arts and entertainment sectors. Students study one of five core disciplines: music, visual arts, dance, theater, and cinematic arts. Specializations in opera, theatre technology, music technology, fashion, and more are part of the program too. Classes are taught by professional artists-in-residence who provide mentorship and real-world experience. In order to help increase the pipeline of diverse students from throughout LA County and address some of the lack of access to arts training in elementary and middle schools, LACHSA has engaged an Equity Coordinator to build internal and external partnerships with LACHSA. Through these outreach efforts, the Coordinator will be reaching talented yet socioeconomically disadvantaged youth who may have no access to arts tools or training, introducing them to opportunities with or at LACHSA.",

While these numbers show a great deal of diversity, our goal is to achieve demographics that even better reflect those of students across LA County. We will measure the impact of the DEI work by the Equity Coordinator's outreach and partnership building through the interest in, and matriculation to LACHSA from communities that will benefit from this uplift. We will also measure the number of programs and partnerships that are developed with elementary and middle school students throughout the county as well as with other non profit arts organizations and providers.

Sadly, despite the lower number of reports, the cases we've supported during the pandemic have also been more violent and have included increases in multi-sibling abuse. We believe the well-being of each victim of sexual and/or physical abuse, and the minimizing of any additional trauma to them, is paramount to any investigation of child abuse. Our ability to minimize the trauma experienced by these young victims and their non-offending family members, while providing the high-quality forensic interviewing and advocacy services to their case investigators, will be determined by the number of qualified forensic interviewers we are able to hire.",

In order to continue being prepared for a surge in child abuse referrals and requests for forensic interviews, I am proposing the recruitment and hiring of 2 additional part-time forensic interviewers with these qualifications to provide interviewing support for 48 additional hrs. per week. The opportunity to increase forensic interviewer resources would enable us to support a greater share of the child abuse investigations in L.A. County. The addition of 2 qualified forensic interviewers for 12 months would significantly improve our ability to process expected increases in referrals. Each part-time (24 hrs. per week) interviewer can support 6 interviews per week (2/day). Over a 7-month period this would equate to about 336 additional interviews we could provide. This many additional interviews would equal a 67% increase over the 502 forensic interviews we conducted last year and more closely approximate the annual number of pre-pandemic referrals we received in 2019 (717).

Currently, in addition to ours, there are only 6 other CACs supporting forensic interviewing and advocacy services for the investigation of these thousands of child abuse cases across L.A. County. Even in down years like 2020 and 2021, the sheer number of cases mean each CAC can potentially face many, many more cases than it can currently handle. We need to be prepared to support the demand for more case investigations. *https://dcfs.lacounty.gov/resources/data-and-monthly-fact-sheets/",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "PIQE’s Family STEM Engagement Program, offered in English and Spanish, educates and empowers low-income multi-lingual and multi-cultural families by teaching them how to: (1) support their children's education by creating a home environment conducive to learning; (2) help improve children’s academic performance; (3) support the social-emotional development of children; (4) develop constructive relationships with other families, teachers, administrators, and counselors; (5) navigate the school system and take full advantage of the resources provided to their children; and (6) prepare their children for a postsecondary education. Families will receive STEM specific programming in order to demystify STEM concepts that are often thought of to be too challenging or complex. This program encourages families to ask about whether their children are taking the correct math and science classes, enrolling in accelerated programs, researching internship opportunities, and seeking additional academic help when needed. Families will also learn about the latest technologies and fields of study such as coding, robotics, artificial intelligence, genetics (in medicine, agriculture, forensic science, etc.) and alternative energy. Through interactive discussions and hands-on activities, families become familiar with various STEM related careers, wage benefits, and the academic preparation students need to strive for a future in a STEM career.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The expected outcomes for families that participate in our STEM education programming are that at least: 80% of families will know what the acronym STEM means; 75% of families will encourage their students to pursue a career in STEM; 70% of families will discuss STEM at home; 80% of families will understand the connection between college admission requirements and STEM fields; 80% of families will understand the pay scale for jobs in STEM; and 80% of families will know the different postsecondary pathways that lead to careers in STEM. At the systemic level, we anticipate that the long-term outcomes of the program will be that students in LA County will strengthen their STEM skills. The program will improve the lives of low-income children and children of color by improving academic outcomes and college and career pathways within STEM, thus strengthening the LA community.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We collect data on all of our process and outcome measures in order to determine the impact of our programs. For outcome data, specifically, we utilize retrospective surveys to measure family outcomes. These surveys measure families’ changed knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding STEM education. Our Family STEM Engagement programs have been successful across California. This school year alone, as a result of our programming: 83% of families know what the acronym STEM means (24% before); 81% of families encourage their students to pursue a career in STEM (45% before); 71% of families discuss STEM at home (31% before); 85% of families understand the connection between college admission requirements and STEM fields (35% before); 85% of families understand the pay scale for jobs in STEM (35% before); and 87% of families know the different postsecondary pathways that lead to careers in STEM (36% before).",

Empowering with these communities is essential toward the goal of achieving educational equity, particularly within the area of STEM education. STEM fields remain stubbornly un-diverse, with Black and Latinx workers consistently underrepresented, and current STEM postsecondary degree attainment rates indicate that trend will continue, per the Pew Research Center. This issue is exasperated by the fact that STEM job growth outpaces non-STEM jobs. Our programming aims to combat this trend by providing families with the knowledge and skills to be active participants in their children’s education and partner with schools to ensure their children achieve their full potential within the STEM fields and beyond."

The 2022-23 academic year will be the first full year of expanded support services. Grade level reading scores will be measured using the Lexia RAPID assessment tool, the Renaissance STAR Reading Test, and the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC). More broadly, we will measure improvements in: attendance, engagement, completion of internships, post-secondary planning, graduation and college matriculation rates, and parent involvement. Our school climate survey will measure the degree to which students feel safe, supported, and included. Early results indicate that our current EL students are more engaged in school, more likely to complete an internship, have better attendance, participate more fully in social and wellness activities at school, and are more invested in graduation and post-secondary planning.",

Through a partnership with The Advot Project, we will offer an arts-based internship to strengthen English skills, build student confidence, and help them connect with others. Students will participate in mentored career exploration and training opportunities based on their interests. To address students’ emotional health and healing from trauma, our school psychologist will provide counseling and case management services, and referrals to non-profit mental health providers. Daily meditation will help students connect to and calm their inner self; and monthly Wellness Day events will provide opportunities for developing new relationships and forming deeper connections. Field trips and day hikes will help students explore Los Angeles and connect to the natural world. When a student is increasingly absent or stops attending school altogether, our bilingual Community & Parent Liaison will make a home visit to connect with the student and family, and determine what supports are needed to stabilize the household and help the student return to school. This includes emergency assistance, referral to mental health services, and help accessing housing, childcare, and/or legal assistance. Parents will be encouraged to participate in school activities and EL Advisory Council.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "New Village will be the school community where young immigrant women in Los Angeles come to learn, connect and thrive. A grant of $75,000 will help us achieve the following outcomes by August 2023: 1. At least 80 percent of our EL students will achieve a 200-point increase in reading scores. 2. At least 75 percent of EL students will complete an internship and/or career development training opportunity. 3. At least 25 EL students will complete the arts internship with The Advot Project. 4. At least 20 percent of EL parents will participate in one or more school events. 5. All EL students who start the 2022-23 academic year with senior credits will graduate by June 2023. As a result of our work, more disadvantaged young immigrant women in Los Angeles will complete high school, and have the skills and confidence to pursue a college degree or vocational training, secure a well-paying job, access community-based supports for their families, and participate in community and civic life.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Connection is about understanding, participation and inclusion. It is the path from ‘otherness’ to belonging. Our English Learner (EL) students and their families struggle to connect as most do not speak or understand the language they need to succeed in school, build new friendships, find safe housing and well-paying jobs, and navigate social supports. Their ability to communicate who they are, what they’ve experienced, and what they need is limited. The COVID crisis led to devastating isolation and instability among our EL students. Half of our parents are undocumented; most are frontline workers with no access to medical care and little to no leverage with employers. Fear of illness and the demands of caring for family members have kept some EL students at home, further weakening their English skills. It will take intensive efforts in language development, academic and social-emotional support, and linkages to community services to reconnect them to their dreams of a better future.",

Communal support can combat these barriers to foster a connection and to learn from shared unique experiences in a safe space. Accessing legal, economic, and educational resources to navigate the challenges affecting the community are important. Elevating experience means creating a space dedicated to peer/emotional support, resources, civic engagement, legal services, networking, and guidance to protect the rights of community. Workshops and programming aimed at navigating higher education, legal resources, healthcare access, DACA, citizenship, and health promotion prevention are important to improve health equity for the undocumented.

Monthly meetings at the Pomona Pride Center, located in the heart of downtown Pomona, will allow to share experiences, express fears and celebrate success stories. Through these support group meetings, we will provide validation amongst the undocumented community by contributing coping strategies and navigational techniques. Attendees will have access to our existing Resource Pantry, which includes food, hygiene products, clothing and books. Part of this grant will be used to financially support our existing support groups for UndocuQueer persons, which started in 2022. The next goal is to provide access to professional advice. Every month a different topic that is addressing the unique challenges faced by Undocuqueer is addressed. This will include health care professionals providing health education and linkages for Undocuqueer people to access to their health services. Furthermore, for those Undocuqueer persons in higher education, educational administrator will present a path towards higher education.

Ready to Launch has a different ethos – we work to find women who haven’t been given an opportunity yet, whose raw passion and talent is there, but who don’t have the resources to get started. Our fellowship program helps women learn about staff careers and build connections. The fellowship is designed for women seeking entry-level experience in government. We actively recruit from local colleges and universities, nonprofits and community organizations to reach women where they are and offer resources and support that create more inclusive pathways into these fields. We provide training and mentorship to prepare our fellows for the workplace, and then help each one secure an internship in an elected official’s office to gain hands-on experience. Our program is free, and we provide stipend support so that no one has to choose between experience and paying the bills.

This exclusion undermines our democracy and our government’s ability to represent America’s diversity. While there are many organizations focused on helping women and people of color run for office, there is drastically less investment in building the staff pipeline in politics and government and ensuring all women are included. Government offices don’t sufficiently invest in recruitment to reach diverse candidates and a lack of awareness about these careers limit the ability of women from historically marginalized communities to find these opportunities. Unpaid internships bar access to these fields and perpetuate exclusion at all levels. Young people with family household incomes above $200K are 72% more likely to work in these fields compared to those from low income families. For some, taking a government internship means choosing between having money for food or getting experience.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our recruitment efforts are successful. We had 150 applicants across L.A. County for our first two fellowship classes. The majority of our applicants identified as low-income, 90% were women of color, and nearly 70% were from immigrant families. We survey our fellows before and after the program to measure our impact. Participants increased their awareness of the career paths available to them, felt they were more prepared to work in government or politics, and grew more comfortable networking and building professional relationships. We also measure success by tracking the participants’ outcomes after the fellowship – with several alumni already leveraging their fellowship to gain other paid opportunities in the field. For our public events, we partnered with USC’s Center for Leadership by Women of Color on a series to expose attendees to the various career pathways in government and politics. These events reached more than 200 students and emerging women leaders in 2021."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Right now, South Los Angeles and South East Los Angeles are tutoring deserts. There are no private tutoring providers in those communities and there is a very small and fragmented non-profit tutoring sector. Further, the school district is doing very little to serve these communities. Despite unprecedented state funding, just one out 10 LAUSD students has received tutoring to date. Innovate’s parent leaders are pushing LAUSD to make this a priority and expand high-quality tutoring fast while also working to organize the community to strengthen the capacity of local non-profit tutoring providers to meet this need. Innovate leaders are advocating for: The creation of a regional tutoring initiative that will capture additional public and philanthropic funds, capture data and learnings to share best practices to rapidly scale what’s working, and support a workforce pipeline in the education sector. - Effective implementation of the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program in Los Angeles - More state investment, including a sustainable source of long-time funding for out-of-school programs - Accountability for how funds are spent - Expansion of quality tutoring programs embedded in afterschool with more funding and capacity-building for nonprofit providers This funding would support us to build parent leadership and organize families to push for the expansion of high-quality tutoring for students.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If we’re successful, hundreds of the students who were most impacted by the pandemic will get high-quality one-to-one or small group tutoring multiple times a week. Tutoring will allow students to make up for missed learning and catch up so that they can be on track to graduate and go to college. Learning loss will be addressed so that we will not lose a generation of students. This initiative will also create good local jobs in COVID-impacted communities that will place more people of color on pathway to education careers. SELA was deeply impacted by the pandemic. Many SELA residents are essential workers with 41% having to work in-person during the pandemic. Seven of every 10 SELA residents lost their jobs or had their wages cut during the pandemic and many didn’t have savings to fall back on. This initiative will not only support K-12 students, but will hire locally to benefit local college students and adults from SELA who will work as tutors",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "- Establish a team of 25 active parent leaders during 2022-23 who will engage 200+ more community members - 15 elected officials, community leaders and tutoring providers engaged - Public action to amplify the voices of parents and establish the need for tutoring in the region - Winning the expansion of tutoring programs in Southeast LA",

No volunteers including the President of United Hands have received a salary the past two years so our food giveaway is truly a community grass roots effort and labor of love, but an issue your Grant will address. United Hands will continue to run the largest continuous food giveaway in Compton without city assistance, yet be a mainstay since COVID began. We will operate from our easy-to-access outdoor location near a bus line on a main thoroughfare, 138th and Wilmington Avenue. We will partner for food with the LA Regional Food Bank as well as Amazon and Farmlink, a nationally-recognized college student initiative known for salvaging farm crops being plowed under at the height of COVID. We will pick-up from the food banks as well as receive delivery of semi-truck loads of produce and food goods at the site. Our food giveaways are regularly held weekly on Saturday but normally operate three or four days out of the week.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "United Hands has successfully operated since COVID began under the sheer willpower of impacted residents putting their coins together to rent or maintain a truck in operation to pick-up and distribute food. Our success is dependent upon the people power of our very recipients. Our vision is to reduce and eliminate any dependence on the people and secure a more permanent funding base to continue our operation. United Hands was overwhelmed at the start of COVID with thousands in line, including referrals of clients from unions and even medical clinics. The demand went unabated for at least a year, and now continues with recipients forming lines as soon as the truck arrives, waiting up to two to three hours for the truck to be unloaded and bags or boxes to be assembled and distributed. The immediate recognition of a food giveaway in progress has led to the repeat appearance of recipients in our car and walk-up lines, attesting to the continuing need to address food insecurity.",

We currently serve with a special emphasis on underserved households, the unrepresentated homeless population and vulnerable seniors and mothers with infants, offering a delivery service for those unable to visit our site and a separate line and priority access for seniors, the disabled and pregnant. United Hand volunteers take food, especially when prepared meals are available, for distribution to homeless encampments located around the city, the canals, railroads, alleys, freeways plus low-income trailer parks and housing projects. Food giveaways are held regularly on Saturdays, often up to three to four times a week. We see hunger firsthand. Our President worries our bags or boxes lasts three days, so we must deliver or many will go hungry.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "United Hands of Compton has gained a reputation for being one of the best giveaways in terms of the quality of our food.

As the focus remains on Ukraine and we prepare for an influx of refugees from the region, it is critical that support continues to resettle the many Afghan refugees still facing challenges and requiring assistance.

To start anew in a country, unfamiliar with the culture and language can be incredibly isolating and feel impossible. The Tiyya Foundation embraces the strength and beauty of those different histories to build spaces and experiences where all discover belonging – that’s what sets us apart. Our specifically designed programs like the youth soccer team, culinary academy, Tea & Tots for mothers and children, and housing program – all assist our clients in building the necessary new relationships in their new community, allowing them to plant roots for a successful and sustainable life in Los Angeles and beyond.",

All data is received and organized through Salesforce allowing us to keep a thorough record of our quantitative impact. Each program utilizes multiple tools to survey program participants through formal client satisfaction evaluations that occur annually to gather our qualitative analysis. We evaluate progress towards our program goals through outputs identified in our program logic model to assess participant achievement. Last year, we completed an organization-wide needs assessment that identified exactly how best to serve our clients in this dynamic environment."

There were a staggering 1.4 million attempts. Currently, there is a gap in how our society is addressing this. We fight the hopelessness in a tangible way. And we do that by reminding individuals that they are not alone. I created Find Your Anchor because suicide awareness has long been a cause very near and dear to my heart. I survived multiple attempts. As a society, we’re becoming more distracted and more disconnected. In the height of my darkness, one of my fundamental core beliefs was that nobody would care. I couldn't see the resources around me, and I couldn't feel the love that I was surrounded by. I just felt isolated and alone. With FYA, I wanted to create a network and a community of strangers who care. Because if we can convince somebody that a stranger cares about you, maybe it won't be so hard to believe that your friends and family do, as well.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "At the heart of FYA’s mission is a small blue box. Once referred to as a “mental health first aid kit,” each box is packed with good vibes and materials designed to inspire, soothe, and offer support. This includes a 52+ Reasons to Live deck of cards, an infographic on depression, a list of resources, posters, stickers, a bracelet, a mixtape, a letter, etc. The boxes are intended to be organic in the sense that each person can add their own anchors and inspiration to the box before passing it along. This funding would help us launch more FYA boxes to those struggling throughout LA - many at the lowest point in their lives. $75,000 would reach 5,000 citizens. These box recipients cross all demographics, social classes, and age groups. This program will help us establish deeper roots in LA (relocated from Chicago 3 yrs ago), ensuring that we reach more people who are struggling. The infusion of 5,000+ boxes into the county will help us to create long-lasting partnerships within the community that will extend far beyond this program. FYA boxes enter the world in several different ways: - We launch them organically for people to find - Boxes can be requested online and we will send one, no questions asked (there are too many $$ barriers to mental health) - We partner with schools + organizations to get boxes into more hands. We've partnered with hundreds of schools to customize boxes, do box building workshops, and curate events for students to explore anchors in their lives.",

We will also focus on data that tells us where the most box requests come from, demographics of the box requesters, geographical data, etc. - but nothing compares to the impact of a testimonial. Throughout this project we will continue to measure success in the form of firsthand accounts of box recipients. However, we will also measure success by the number of school partnerships we create, recurring box subscriptions we receive, and workshops we give. One of the ways we have been measuring impact is from our new partnerships via word of mouth. 80% of our new partnerships have come from a referral from another organization. Also, the majority of our partners will come back for more boxes, once the original ones are gone. This tells us that there is significant impact seen and they are finding the boxes useful.",

From the deep, depths of my heart, I thank you. You've saved a life.” - “Loved being able to hold something in my hands while I was struggling.” - “You have saved me over and over again because I use the box as a tool when I’m in crisis and it’s helped every single time.” We are literally growing by the day. This growth directly coincides with our impact. In 2018, we had 668 FYA boxes in the world. 2019 - 4,238 boxes 2020 - 13,504 boxes 2021 - 28,425 boxes 2022 (as of May 27) - 35,712 boxes!

To develop skills, strengths, ideas, and opinions, only to have no place to exercise them is unjust. The Olive Tree Commons provides affordable housing for formerly homeless youth – a safe place from which to discover the excitement of their next transition.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The majority of returns to homelessness for youth who have spent years working in shelter and housing programs to develop connection, coping skills, strengths, and the logistical necessities of employment/education in order to provide them with some permanency – are directly attributable to the lack of affordable housing in Los Angeles. Despite their best efforts and the support of well-known programs, the fact remains: An 18-24 year old who is starting their life from scratch with entry level employment and an only-recently illuminated set of inherent skill cannot afford the $1,500 - $2,000/month average rent for an apartment in this great city. After leaving programming, our youth are swimming in the deep end, and whether it’s a pandemic, a tragedy, sickness, or any other of life’s myriad curveballs, it doesn’t take much for our youth to find themselves back in a life of trauma. To that end, formerly homeless youth need affordable places to live. Olive Tree Commons is that place.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Olive Tree Commons offers 16 affordable units to youth who are launching into life and most eagerly leaving the moniker of ‘homeless’ behind them. For good. The first of its kind model for morally sound follow-up care will provide youth who were formerly experiencing homelessness with ethical rental rates based on 30% of their income. This provides them with the physical and theoretical space to establish their healthy, excited, limitless identity as members of a community. It affords them the ability to make career changes and to experiment with adult life in the ways that those of us with intact family and social supports did when we were just beginning our journeys as adults. The Olive Tree Commons is an apartment building near Wilshire/Crenshaw, purchased by CHC in 2019. In the time since, we have used only private fundraising to renovate it, always with the intention of providing affordable housing accompanied by light-touch resident services (i.e., case management if residents need it) in a way that is self-sustaining. Indeed, since the building is owned, and the renovations complete, we only need this first year of salaries for case management covered before the abbreviated rent paid by residents will pay for the maintenance of the building as well as the aforementioned resident services. We are so excited to establish this replicable model of responsible follow-up care to youth who have worked so very hard to add to the exquisite diversity of Los Angeles.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "L.A. County will be better as a result of The Olive Tree Commons. The youth CHC serves are diverse in culture, identity, strengths, and ideas; as a result of this project, they will have a safe homebase from which to flex those ideas, grow them, and eventually transition to the next phases of their lives. Their residency is not time-bound, but – as with most young adults – transitions are frequent, and an affordable place for them to establish the starting point to their intellectual, professional, and social journeys is a great (and replicable!) coup for L.A. That’s the long-term goal. For the short-term, we would consider it a success for all 16 units to be leased up. Further, we will consider it a success when we gauge the intensity of the things that the project’s soft-touch case manager is providing, so we can better hone that role. Finally, we will consider it a success if residents are frank re: how the project could be better and more reflective of their unique needs.",

We will measure the success of the program by: 1) Ensuring that the building remains fully leased; 2) All residents are paying their reduced rent on-time; 3) None of the residents return to homelessness or unstable living situations; 4) The youth who leave the Commons are doing organically so for bigger and better things. Lastly, we will consider this program a success if it leads to other agencies/entities replicating the model; in that way, the indirect long-term benefit is limitless. There are 6,000 youth experiencing homelessness in L.A., and it’s up to us to ensure they have a safe space to exercise their gifts when they leave shelter-based programming.",

Underserved youth from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds may not have knowledge of and access to the stability and benefits that entertainment industry jobs offer (e.g. health and disability insurance, pensions, union membership). The clear, prescient, and pervasive needs for the entertainment industry to be more diverse and inclusive include reducing the inherent ageism that has historically excluded older adults with a lifetime of valuable industry experience.

This program will collectively benefit students from low-income communities, retired industry members, and the entertainment community as a whole. With the EICMP, MPTF will work with existing internship programs to connect retired industry members with meaningful mentorship opportunities for the next generation. Mentors, who will represent below-the-line and above-the-line jobs, will be able to share their life experience and workplace knowledge with younger people just entering the industry. It will also give members of the younger generation a personal contact in the industry with whom they can trust without fear of being judged. The ability to have an open and honest conversation about the business can be instrumental for a young person learning how to navigate a tough industry. The EICMP exists to address a seemingly divergent set of needs facing the industry—those of its retirees and the need for diversity and inclusion—and couples them in a way that transcends generations to build upon its legacy while strengthening the future.",

The EICMP comes at a significant time in Hollywood. Great efforts are being made in addressing the problems of diversity and inclusion within the industry. With the announcement of the new industry-supported LAUSD magnet school and other existing programs that provide youth participants with valuable work experience, we feel these programs can be enhanced by including intergenerational mentorship. The goal of this program is to inspire and support a diverse group of young people, including first generation entertainment workers, who will be exposed to workplace opportunities that come with healthcare and pension benefits. This will contribute to a more inclusive entertainment community in Los Angeles, potentially reflected in future residents of the MPTF congregate living campus and MPTF constituents.",

With an eye towards the future, CARECEN recognizes the toll that the pandemic took on those in the field and on aspiring professionals. They need interventions that foster hope and a restored perspective. Experiential learning addresses these short-/longer-term needs. Mentored fellowships expand career options and encourage persistence to graduation, particularly for first-gen/undocumented students who have lacked access to opportunities.

Mentored by DREAM Center/CARECEN staff, fellows gain advocacy/organizing skills as they implement events and campaigns (275-300 hours/semester) that increase access to immigration legal services. In addition, CARECEN seeks to build on past experiences and organize a two-week human rights trip to Guatemala in December. Over the years, we have seen countless immigrant students, who must request advance parole to travel, be excluded from traditional campus study abroad programs. The 10 attendees – DACA students/DREAM Center staff/CARECEN attorneys - will learn firsthand about immigration movements from and through Northern Triangle countries, attend seminars/discussions with regional leaders, and visit universities and local NGOs.

But many city or statewide programs do not capture the real need of many seniors who need assistance to survive. Because of the cultural stigma against seeking help, we know that the needs and data for older adults in communities of color is very much underreported and historically overlooked by LA County institutions and services.

This was paired with a meal-match program where for every meal sold, a second meal was bought using sponsorship funds to feed senior citizens in immigrant communities from Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Thai Town, Koreatown, Glendale and Little Saigon—and doubling the restaurant’s revenue at the same time. To date, DBK has sold over $100,000 in meals for local restaurants and raised over $25,000 to provide meals to BIPOC elders in immigrant communities. In 2022, RYE evolved from this grassroots work into a nonprofit organization to expand on the impact and insight of feeding seniors meals that mean something to them. For immigrant communities, food has always been what closed the gaps to make the distance between homes feel more familiar. Culturally specific meals offer a portal to the comfort of being cared for in ways that honor the experiences of our elders. That’s why RYE works with local restaurants to provide meals to seniors that they actually love. Through our work, we can show seniors they are not forgotten while supporting BIPOC and immigrant-owned restaurants that preserve the diversity and culture across Los Angeles."

Bioswales will help protect stormwater through vegetated, shallow, landscaped depressions designed to capture, treat, and infiltrate stormwater runoff as it moves downstream. Greenery will cool the area. The 13,000 square foot space will include cooling native tree canopy, as well as fragrant, edible and medicinal native foliage. It will be enjoyed via meditative trails, seating areas, and a community patio.",
    "Describe the specific role of the partner organization(s) in the project, program, or initiative.": "Not applicable",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "As the violence in Watts has declined over the past 10 years, the planned spaces must now begin to support the community's peace-building efforts. Watts residents still experience more violence than residents of other LA municipalities - as a direct impact of public sector divestment and neglect. Green infrastructure is shown to create upward spirals of resilience. It has a particularly profound ability to help survivors of violence heal and set conditions for greater community harmony and health. Ample, established tree canopy and large shrubs cool temperatures - and tempers. Birdsong, attracted by regionally native greenery, can significantly increase civility in public spaces. In essence, green infrastructure is mental health infrastructure. In contrast, hard-edged, overbuilt spaces increase danger. Simply living within an over-built environment stimulates a baseline of stress, according to the National Institutes of Health."

The BLS characterizes these projections as “much faster than” most other industries and cites that the median annual pay is $77,700. Part of this high projection of growth stems from the fact that animation jobs are not just limited to projects created by animation powerhouses like Disney, and DreamWorks; but other digital industries like video game design, live-action films, and television production now all utilize animation techniques too. Add to that, the growing number of streaming companies (Netflix and Apple TV), countless platforms for content creators (YouTube and TikTok), and the developing Augmented & Virtual Reality technologies that consumers can already purchase for personal use, and it is no surprise that careers in animation are in such high demand and can lead to so many high-paying careers.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The BRIC Program will train 60-75 high school students to create original digital assets, a written logline, and a polished presentation deck for an original animated series. Guided by professional artists, these students will learn industry techniques that are used in Hollywood. This four-month rigorous program will occur mostly during school time with a few sessions after school and/or over a weekend. During this iterative process, each group will pitch their work to Industry experts and integrate feedback to strengthen their final professional-grade pitch deck. The BRIC Foundation has led similar programs over the last four years and utilized Industry Instructors from Disney, DreamWorks, and Nickelodeon. We will bring in instructors for the same or similar studios for this Training. Additionally, two industry mentors will meet each class once a month to provide guidance and insight, customized to meet each class's needs and interests. Just as important, a Curriculum Specialist will support and empower key educators from each school site. During the planning phase, the Curriculum Specialist will review all industry project lessons to make sure that they are aligned with California CTE Model Curriculum Standards and the Common Core State Standards. Also, the Curriculum Specialist will meet monthly with nine school-site teachers to address any concerns they may have about the program. This will ensure all three schools have an equal level of support for their own students.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "1). Student participants will create a professional animation pitch packet, where each student or team will: •. Design and drawn original characters and environments •. Develop and write a compelling storyline, logline, and presentation deck 2) Students will work with industry artists and instructors and receive professional critiques, and then apply that feedback to improve their skills and project designs while better understanding the iterative process in creative development in the animation industry. 3) School-site educators will be trained in industry skills and techniques so that they can further assist their students in-between and after the Pre-Apprenticeship Training sessions.

Worse yet, many Title-1 students may not even know that they have an interest in a potential career in animation or game design because their schools do not offer any hands-on CTE classes to provide that introduction, compared to many affluent high schools across Los Angeles County. This BRIC Training Program offers an alternative pathway for women and people of color to get the training that they need to get their foot in the door for a well-paying career. The majority of our industry teachers and mentors have been women and/or people of color. When minority students see professionals who look like them working at well-known animation studios, it is empowering for these young adults to follow in their footsteps.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The advocacy approach that Clockshop has pioneered with the Kite Festival can serve as a valuable model for LA County: advocacy through joyful acts! While indignation and fiery rhetoric have their place in the art of protest, we believe that the Festival has shown another way––the simple, intergenerational, exhilarating act of flying kites as a means to galvanize public support to protect public land. We’ll build on this approach with the William Mead & Ann St. communities, adding pedestrian actions and artistic co-creation to foster deeper connections to the park. Building more pedestrian-friendly, green infrastructure within historically underserved neighborhoods serves both community wellness and climate resiliency. Equitable access to open spaces like LASHP, created by and for the park’s historic residential populations, requires ongoing vigilance against development pressures.The park is thus a vital test case for many of our region’s interrelated environmental justice issues.",
    "Describe the specific role of the partner organization(s) in the project, program, or initiative.": "Clockshop will have the lead role on this project, maging its messaging, progress, evaluation, implementation, and goals. LA River State Park Partners, a long-standing partner of Clockshop’s and the supporting nonprofit organization for the three State Parks along the LA River, will lead the collaboration with Ann Street Elementary School, which the school leadership enthusiastically supports. The partners seek to increase their engagement of local schools as well as build a coalition for new pedestrian safety measures surrounding the park. California State Parks is the long-standing public agency partner, and a collaborator on the implementation of the Kite Festival and related programming.",

The lack of long-sought crosswalk over busy North Spring at Ann St. is a major environmental justice issue, hindering access for some of our highest needs neighbors to the world class green space just blocks from their doors. While the Ann St. crossing has now been prioritized by DOT, we must work to ensure that this vital piece of infrastructure comes to fruition. In addition to pedestrian access issues, the park and its free community programs are also under threat from an aerial tram gondola proposed for the park’s southern end. The gondola would stretch over the southern portion of the park, taking public land for its infrastructure, jamming airspace, and blocking park users’ world-class views of Elysian Park, the Downtown skyline, and historic Broadway Viaduct.",

We also wanted to raise awareness of the gondola as a threat, and empower community voices around park access and equity. The “Stop the Gondola” campaign was able to collect 441 petition signatures at the event itself, and our earned media impact through an LA Times article, KPCC interview, and KTLA live TV spot reached nearly 400,000 people across SoCal with the message to protect public lands against the gondola project. We also wanted our audience to reflect the surrounding community.

Launched in 2021, the Kite Festival has grown in size and impact, with the May 21 2nd Annual event drawing over 3,000 Angelenos from the diverse communities around the park and beyond for a day of joyful kite flying and a “gallery in the sky.” Our planned collaboration with Ann St. Elementary will include a series of kite making workshops for K-5th grades, visits by kite masters, and a culminating pre-Festival celebration just for school families with kite flying contests, prizes, and food. In a second, related intervention, artist collective Public Matters will take over the College Street crosswalk as well as the Ann St. sidewalk areas with their “Slow Jam” pedestrian activations, designed to heighten awareness and increase safety at key crossings. The historically underserved communities around LA State Historic Park fought for years to bring this beautiful park into existence, and our organizations thus oppose any use of our shared public park land, airways, or viewsheds for private enterprise. The Kite Festival and our longer term community activations will use joy and play to help build awareness of the need to protect the park’s open skies as well as shine a light on key infrastructure needs."

The report also pointed out discrepancies behind the camera. In 2017 just 12.6 of Hollywood directors were people of color. Despite efforts to bolster racial diversity...it is evident that there are barriers to having a more diverse submission pool that goes beyond an assumption or perceived reality that works featuring or created by people of color simply do not exist.” (Screendance from Film to Festival, 2022) The field is dominated by well-funded, European men and women, with extensive training and budgets. Most women and BIPOC artists work in a DIY self-produced method. Our intention to decolonize the field and level the playing field for those traditionally shut out with education, funding and presentation. We have increased representation in the few short years of this project. This success encourages us to continue.",

The awards are beginning to grow, the discussion has become more diverse, our mentees are now jury members at other festivals.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "When the COVID epidemic paused live events dance was translated onto screens, DCW became acutely aware that we need to be at the forefront of production of new dance films. We took this opportunity to work directly with underrepresented artists, by creating a groundbreaking mentorship program. The DCW Finishing Fund program will provide more choreographers with a production team, equipment and mentor to make a dance for the screen. Choreographers will be selected from local dance festivals that highlight the work of women and BIPOC artists such as Blacktinx, Los Angeles Dance Festival, and REDCAT’s NOW festival. Choreographers will be paired with a producer/mentor to gain an \"education\" on best practices for dance-film making, including lighting, sound, storyboarding, camera operation, editing and post production. Artists will be given eight weeks to create a film. The mentors and filmmakers will be chosen based on artistic excellence and their ability to collaborate as equal creative partners, encouraging a consensual creative dialogue wherein DCW asks what the artists need and supports those needs. Films will be presented at the DCW annual film festival, where artists will be invited to speak about the process. Following the creation and presentation of the films at the annual festival, the films become of the DCW touring program, as well as streaming platforms DCW has partnered with, providing revenue to the filmmakers.",

This program offered mentorship, but also the opportunity for professional development and networking at the in-person programs. This process has inspired me to continue my journey a screen dance artist and future educator. - Irishia Hubbard \"During the panel, I noticed that us grant recipients were culturally diverse in background; this created a new, remarkable opportunity for me to befriend and learn from other bipoc dance film artists! Since then, DCW has kept in contact with all of us grant recipients and has sent us funding opportunities. To know that DCW is in a position to keep hiring, allocating funds, and making space for new voices gives me great joy and hope for my bipoc and dance community.\" - Lextia Cordova"

Changing attitudes within Los Angeles means changing behaviors, both of which contribute to a healthier, more aware community of active bystanders. Increased community awareness helps shift from victim to predator blaming. Once survivors are believed and supported by their community, empowered survivors are more likely to seek medical attention and report the crime. An informed community leads to an informed jury, then the District attorney will feel more confident in prosecuting cases. More prosecutions lead to more convictions. More convictions establish predator accountability in the justice system. More convictions signify a community with a NO tolerance policy for sexual or domestic violence.

We use a community-based approach to prevention, ensuring schools, businesses, law enforcement and beyond are committed to survivor-centered responses and sexual violence education. Our programs provide direct services to survivors who are still dealing with the constant effects of sexual and domestic violence. The programs include support groups, advocacy assistance regarding the civil and criminal legal system, therapy, permanent support that promotes healing from the impact of trauma and education on intimate partner violence, child abuse, sexual assault, and consent. Because healing is not linear and every survivor has special needs, we created a survivorship program amongst survivors to encourage one another. Our survivorship programs are innovative methods of therapy that consist of social activities and therapeutic recreation: yoga, sounds baths, mediation, self-defense classes, retreats, spa treatments, dance, one on one therapy as well as group therapy.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Sexual violence is a widespread problem in California, traumatically affecting people’s lives and negatively affecting communities and society. Statewide, 86% of women and 53% of men reported experiencing some form of sexual assault in their lifetime. The impact of sexual violence extends far beyond the assault itself. Social structures shape victims’ experiences with institutions designed to help them: shelters, hospitals, police, and courts, but often end up re-victimizing instead. The short and long terms effects of such trauma are vast: PTSD, social anxiety, suicide, depression and/or drug and alcohol addiction. There is a lack of survivor support and rehabilitation. Advocates, on-call professionals, emotional support, therapy, police reporting options in a safe and confidential location is a lifeline for survivors. Coordinated sexual assault services are survivor-centred and reduce the long-term effects of trauma by providing survivors social support and control over their care."

Participants would ideally come to know students from a variety of communities and backgrounds and would find common ground around a shared interest in art. An ideal outcome would be that participants become aware of a myriad of potential art-related careers and they would gain an understanding of the pathways to those careers. Los Angeles would benefit from the opportunity to give youth access to arts outside the classroom, where these future leaders learn creative problem-solving skills that they bring back to their own circles of influence.",

Poor oral health severely limits the ability of individuals to obtain and maintain employment, housing and other life necessities, and can lead to and exacerbate other ailments, causing endocarditis, cardiovascular disease, and pneumonia. Similarly, not having access to corrective eye-glasses can stymie any ability to accurately fill out forms, maintain employment or even be informed on legal issues.",

These are the seeds of entrepreneurialism that C11 cultivates. An example of the impact are these student's words, “My favorite part was Thrive in Joy. Seeing Nick’s parents still working to maintain his legacy is really inspiring. I see them changing lives through his story, and it truly makes me want too (sic) as well.” 402 teens participated in SIA C11 workshops over the three-year period of 2018-2021.

Thrive in Joy provides a facilitator for each school to support student leaders in structuring their weekly meetings, planning their service projects, and incorporating Thrive in Joy’s C11 strength of character program into all aspects of the Club’s activities. Senior student leaders are offered internship opportunities with Thrive in Joy as social impact entrepreneurs. Club leaders are also given access to a private college counselor and we fund application fees to add colleges beyond the limited free package available to low-income students. Students are paired with a volunteer mentor to meet with via Zoom at their mutual convenience. The recurring theme in our program is “student-led.” The C11 facilitator supports student leaders in discovery of their own character strengths while leaders, in turn, inspire club members, and often engage the entire student body in their social impact initiatives. Club members get to lead C11 workshops for other student groups including athletes. The 1-2 hour workshops emphasize the importance of authentic relationships and the positive outcomes that result when a team works together through mutual understanding of each other’s common as well as unique character traits and what brings meaning to their lives.",

When asked to provide a word that best describes the club student responses included, “ Awesome, Inspiring, Creative, Supportive, Unique, Helpful, Joyful, Caring, and Rejuvenating.” 95% of respondents said they frequently or sometimes feel that being aware of their character strengths will help their success as a student. One student summarized her connection with Club Thrive in Joy as follows, “I have become much more bold and outspoken about issues that I care deeply about. Last year, I was extremely insecure, depressed, and anxious, and this year I have become a completely different person. I am so grateful to the C11 program for what you have taught me!” These are the developments we expect to see in more students if our program can be in more schools.",

Those who will be entering high school in the next two years have also fallen behind in both their academics and normal social interactions that teens depend on for their emotional stability. At the same time, parents and guardians of these teens have been under significant pressure economically and emotionally, and many families have lost loved ones or their health has been adversely affected by the pandemic. In a recent survey we conducted with a random group of students at USC Hybrid High, 67% stated depression and/or anxiety as one of the biggest problems students face today and 50% stated time management as a significant challenge. Both of these issues lead to lack of motivation to pursue college. Since higher education is the key to financial stability, programs like C11 that elevate students' self-esteem are essential to their future success. The need is urgent."

While only 8% of Angelenos are black, this community represents 20% of pedestrian fatalities. Children are also at risk from a lack of traffic safety as traffic collisions are a leading cause of death for children between ages 5-14. LADOT’s High-Injury Network identifies 6% of city streets that account for 70% of deaths and severe injuries for people walking.

Driver speeds are influenced by roadway design and individual driver behaviors. At UML, we want to work with the community to identify mobility technologies that can encourage safer driving behaviors to help reduce collisions resulting in fatalities or severe injuries. To avoid top-down approaches to implementing new technology solutions, UML wants to work with communities to identify roadway safety challenges, discuss solutions, identify potential technologies, and develop a framework for installation that meets the needs of the community. We will accomplish this by: * Partnering with local community groups to engage community members through workshops, surveys, and pop-up engagements to understand local traffic safety concerns. * Identifying community members that can work iteratively on the project with UML as part of a community working group (CWG). * Release a request for information (RFI) for mobility technology companies to propose their solutions for addressing concerns identified with community members. The RFI will be reviewed by the CWG to ensure the communities concerns are effectively represented. * Facilitate pilot projects to understand technology capabilities and work with CWG to introduce community members to the technology and evaluate its effectiveness.",

We envision a Los Angeles where LGBTQ+ youth feel supported, safe, and empowered. No LGBTQ+ youth will face dropping out at school or feel isolated because of who they are. Our program will eliminate those challenges and increase access to mentoring for LGBTQ+ youth. LGBTQ+ youth will move on from our program graduating high school and college, forming deep relationships with their peers, and building the next new world-changing business In this grant year, we plan to reach 80 youth and engage 25 LGBTQ+ adult mentors.

At the same time, there are dozens upon dozens of film crews shooting in the very same locations as those living on the street. Next to every film set is an encampment of souls, seeking selter, food, water- basic human needs. Yet, until now, there has been some great divide between these resources and those who need them. For decades productions have lived in fear of donating to those in need for fear of what might happen to them in return. Hundreds upon thousands of pounds of food is wasted every day in our city next to someone who is unhoused just 10 feet away. This not only adds waste to our landfills and in turn creates more greenhouse gases.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our work is already impacting Los Angeles greatly. The more funds Every Day Action receives the more people we will be able to help across the entire city. In 2020, our first year, we reallocated around 110,000 meals to those in need. Oftentimes the food is picked up and delivered to someone in need within 10 minutes of the donation. There are hundreds of film sets across LA and every day each set wastes hundreds upon thousands of pounds of food. Until very recently, most of that food was thrown out. We carry liability insurance and offer contracts to studios, releasing them of any liability of the food donation. This allows our non-profit to own the food donation from the moment we pick it up and give us the ability to then donate to someone in need. The hot food leaves the caterer and is brought to shelters, community fridges, youth shelters, encampments, and anyone who reaches out needing a meal. We work with every major studio and simply need more funding.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our outreach is tracked daily by our drivers. When they pick up the food donation from each set; they send in photos, meal counts, & where the donation was given to. After almost 2 years of operation, we are now delivering to almost every shelter that feeds across Los Angeles. Our donation of food, almost daily to some, have allowed many to expand their food service to include lunch as well as dinner. In addition, each nonprofit/shelter is also spending less of their funding on food- since we can bring them gourmet delicious meals that are often a higher quality than the shelter can afford. This puts more funding back into the rehab of the unhoused, since food is no longer a cost. We also supported a non-profit in Skid Row every Tuesday last year; bringing them as many food donations as we could to their weekly meal & aid event. Prior to our involvement, they were serving Dominos Pizzas & were able to provide nutritious meals as an alternative for free for hundreds all year.",

The more drivers we are able to pay; the more television productions we are able to support. Currently we have 1 full time employee with 4-6 rotating part time employees. We are at our limit of outreach unless we receive more funds. One driver can pick up from up to 5 shows in one day, depending upon our production schedule. Currently we support about 15 shows a day when we are running at full capacity. Once we are able to support a full Southern California film production schedule, picking up from 30+ sets daily, one driver will be able to cover more sets more efficiently due to the number of sets that will fall in the same neighborhoods. This program has the ability to feed thousands across Southern California every week. With proper funding for more full time employees, our outreach on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis will grow exponentially.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "LA Voice’s Faith in Housing program helps congregations to develop affordable and permanent supportive housing by identifying sites, guiding the application and permitting process, providing a selection of model designs, and offering a network of support for financing and construction. However, because the process for review and discernment can take an extensive amount of time—requiring additional layers of approval if tied to denominational oversight—we expedite the identification of viable congregations to more efficiently guide them. We will hold 2 educational cohorts of 10 congregations, for a total of 20 congregations each year. Each cohort agrees to delegate at least 2 representatives to participate in a 4-session, interactive curriculum. This model will allow congregations to receive information and network with one another while addressing concerns and enables LA Voice to prioritize sites with more favorable zoning and congregational will. Further, to address restrictive zoning laws that limit affordable housing development on commercial, public, and church-owned lands, LA Voice works with jurisdictions on the creation of overlay zones that eliminate the need for site-by-site changes. This powerful advocacy allows faith communities to fulfill their expressed desires to house those in need and moves us closer to our goal of establishing an overlay zone for all of California, making all church sites eligible to build affordable housing by right on their land.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In the next year, we aim to add 250 affordable housing units to our pipeline. This builds on our past success; for example, in August 2020 a Culver City church signed an option to ground lease for a project that will result in 95 units of low income and permanent supportive housing. LA Voice is supporting the church through pre-development. In February 2021, a second option to ground lease was executed for a 60 unit adaptive reuse development in Inglewood, a city undergoing rapid gentrification. LA Voice also helped a downtown congregation execute an exclusive negotiating agreement for a 686-unit market rate high rise with 137 units of affordable housing in April 2021. By serving as intermediaries and advisors, LA Voice creates effective partnerships between congregations and developers. As a result of our zoning advocacy, Sierra Madre became the first city in the state to include a Religious Overlay in their adopted Housing Element draft for the Regional Housing Needs Assessment.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Housing affordability in Los Angeles County had reached a critical point even before the massive financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. An estimated 88% of county households across all income brackets are “cost-burdened,” or spending 30-50% of income on rent or mortgage payments. Those facing housing instability, eviction, and homelessness are heavily concentrated in Black and Latino communities. The shortage of housing also stems from the lack of houses being built in recent decades, and state and regional policies now require local governments to plan for 341,000 homes that are affordable to low and very low-income people by 2030. Meanwhile, congregations across the County are sitting on land that has been underutilized as membership continues to decline. LA Voice is using this opportunity to meet some of the challenges of affordable housing production and supply and provide a source of income for congregations so that they can continue to serve the community.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We address the root causes of the affordable housing shortage in the county and statewide—a confluence of systemic racism, lack of sufficient production, poor policy choices, and the use of real estate as a commodity vs. a “human right” or basic need, among others. Through our network of faith-based organizations and partners, LA Voice is leading a growing movement. By facilitating this work with congregations, addressing zoning barriers to development on congregational land, and conducting grassroots organizing that engages community members in advocating to their government, we can create the communities we want. Another strategy is combating NIMBY attitudes (ie, \"Not In My Backyard,” or opposition to neighborhood change) through education and testimonials from people who are impacted. Lastly, by facilitating the adoption of an overlay zone, we can move Los Angeles County to remove barriers for thousands of faith-based organizations to build affordable housing on their property."

We believe that a student who gets to select what he or she wants to do (be it learn to be a chef or a coder) helps a student with self-reliance, a chosen skill set, and most importantly motivation. The benefit of allowing a student to select an enrichment opportunity is that a student can taking responsibility for a part of his/her life. We are currently in discussions with PUSD to determine the optimal way to provide enrichment. This may be in the form of a scholarship to specific local programs or support of a new program designed in partnership with PUSD to best serve the needs of the middle school student.

In the most recent report, Dr. Ana-Christina Ramón concludes that when it comes to filmmaking, \"women and people of color continue to receive less financing...the chronic underinvestment in women and people of color creates limited opportunities for them to showcase their talents to a wider audience.” This underinvestment in women and people of color is, unfortunately, not just an issue in Hollywood but in the worlds of comics and gaming. In comics, men outnumber women nine-to-one behind the scenes at both DC and Marvel, and 79%of people working on comics are white. In the gaming world, women make up 41% of gamers in the US, but only 18% of games feature a female protagonist. After spending several years with these limited opportunities, I created Shero Comics to address the issue of underinvestment in women and people of color head-on."

Studies also show that 85% of museum collections are by white artists. VPAM’s museum education and workforce development programs address lack of diversity in the museum field, which perpetuates museums as white dominated spaces that make them less inclusive of BIPOC contributions and audiences. Moreover, because museums function to reflect a society’s collective and cultural identity, the marginalization of BIPOC in cultural institutions makes their contributions less visible in the present and effectively erases these contributions in archives of our past.",

Offered each winter, the Washington DC Internship program (DCIP) comprises a five-day intensive prep and orientation at VPAM; a four-week, all-expenses-paid and stipend-supported internship in Washington D.C. working at one of the Smithsonian museums; and two follow-up sessions at VPAM to discuss outcomes and opportunities for student academic careers. In the Museum Studies Certificate Program (MSCP) ELAC students complete 7 courses in Art History, Library Science, and Anthropology as well as a stipend-supported museum internship, offered each spring at a local arts institution. The DCIP and MSCP are coordinated by VPAM’s Curator of Educational Programs, who also supports students throughout the academic year by organizing wraparound services including: opportunities to attend professional conferences; guest speaker presentations and technical workshops; career guidance; and overseeing VPAM’s new, on-site Learning Lab.

To assess impact each semester, the museum calculates the number of students in our programs, noting the percentage of annual increases, how many complete internships and obtain Museum Studies Certificates, and how many go on to 4-year academic programs and secure employment in the arts and museum fields. Qualitative data is collected in surveys, interviews, and testimonials from students served. Student tracking, surveys, and testimonials help assess how museum education programs led to further educational/career opportunities, how the experiences impacted students’ career paths. Data helps enhance programming, educational services, and recruitment.",

Overall, support for this program contributes to a more diverse and equitable arts workforce that better reflects the true diversity of Los Angeles. A study by the LA County Department of Arts and Culture reported 69% of LA's arts/culture workforce identified as white/nonhispanic. Our arts workforce should more closely reflect 74% BIPOC that make up LA. VPAM's programs are making a difference. Between 15-20 students who participated in our programs entered 4-year programs, furthered professional development, or acquired jobs in a museum or related arts field.",

In our 4 years working with small businesses, we found that personalized coaching from a trusted source (business navigators) was highly effective. These sessions provide business training, encouragement, and accountability in a series of ongoing interactions (twice monthly for 3 or 6 months). Participants report achieving results that would not have been possible without this resource. Providing personalized support requires trained coaches with business acumen background combined with cultural competency and a high level of caring. Many quality business coaches exist but the cost ($100- $250+ per hour) is out of reach for the small business owners we work with. Our solution is to develop a program to train and certify people to become effective business navigators and to provide this methodology to other community organizations who want to train navigators for their programs. We will accomplish this by developing 1) a curriculum to train and certify navigators, 2) a handbook with best practices for navigation, and 3) a playbook for community organizations to build navigator programs.",

In wealthier communities these resources are readily available. As demonstrated by the inequitable distribution of PPP loans, the negative impacts and lack of support were especially critical for BIPOC entrepreneurs. A McKenzie & Company report stated: “Of all vulnerable small businesses, minority-owned ones may be most at risk. Ensuring that these businesses survive in the current circumstances will require fundamental shifts in how private, public, and social-sector organizations come together to support them.” While BIPOC and women entrepreneurs make up the largest population of start-ups today, these businesses tend to generate less revenue, employ fewer people, and stay small. It is critical to expand support for women and BIPOC small business owners to reduce the wealth gap.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In the long term, Los Angeles County, having a major concentration of small business, will be a more equitable and more resilient economy with ownership and wealth accruing to a diverse population. By developing more robust support and resources available for small businesses, especially in BIPOC communities, more people can successfully launch and grow small businesses, lifting the overall quality of life In the short term (1 year) we envision 2 additional community-based organizations working in under-resourced communities, successfully delivering high quality support for small businesses. By adopting the navigator program many of the barriers and inefficiencies to developing these types of programs can be overcome. We will initially assist 100+ small business owners accelerate revenue growth and help create a generational wealth transfer opportunity. Additionally, this cost-effective program will then be available for use across LA county.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Providing business mentorship or coaching is a best practice for small business support programs. In addition to numerous research reports that discuss the success of this tactic, our anecdotal research with the entrepreneurs in our programs shows that this tactic increases revenue and job creation and adds to the capacity of the business owner to drive business growth and sustainability. The funding for the proposed initiative will go toward improving and scaling the core feature of our work, mentorship. We will document the methods to provide navigation, develop the training methods for navigators, and create a playbook for other organizations to use to deploy a similar program. Additionally, 7 navigators will be trained using these methods and work with participants in our existing programs. The impact on the individual business is measured through revenue growth and jobs created or retained."

    "Describe the specific role of the partner organization(s) in the project, program, or initiative.": "Resilient provides youth development and community intervention services to underprivileged residents most impacted by violence to strengthen persol resilience, develop leadership, and community restoration. Resilient staff are trained peacemakers who work to interrupt the devastating cycle of gun and gang violence. These peacemakers provide mentoring, supportive services, and incident response services within South Park. Through this collaboration, a Resilient peacemaker would be stationed during peak school travel times to ensure safety is maintained for families. This peacemaker will be crucial in establishing and co-creating safety with law enforcement. Resilient would also serve as a leading member of the Regiol School Safety Collaborative.",

Funding from this grant will ensure that children will no longer experience intimidation or violence as they walk to school within South Park. UPI will uplift community leaders and build relationships between residents, officers, and gang intervention workers to ensure neighborhood safety. This work has never been more important, as recent events highlight the need to bridge the gap between law enforcement and communities of color. Funding will also ensure South Los Angeles residents will be empowered to create safety in their communities. UPI’s new South Park Regional School Safety Collaborative will bring together parents, youth, residents of color, school leaders, law enforcement officers, and gang intervention leaders to create a Safe Routes to Schools effort, as well as to reduce violence in the surrounding South Park neighborhood."

Its maker space in Culver City demonstrated high levels of engagement and learning retention with young people. It learned that the lack of public transportation limited the public's access to its programming so it brought its STEM programming into schools throughout LA. We learned that 1 hr per week was not enough for students to develop lifelong passions for learning and the grit, STEM subjects ask of students. The Exploratory then started training educators to integrate programming into their subject and saw an increase in efficacy. However, without real-world community and technology tools, the learning was limited and the demands of STEM fields continued to rise rapidly. It has since piloted the Catalyst Innovation Edusystem in HTH Explorer in San Diego and Santa Monica High School PBL Pathway.

At this time, there is no direct support for asthma and respiratory conditions in our region. Pools of Hope fills a gap in providing wellness services for hard-to-reach populations, including at-risk populations of color, low-income families, and people living with a disability and/or chronic conditions. Pools of Hope has been implementing the RHIP for school-aged children in North Long Beach, Compton and Paramount since 2018. The project was piloted with a Community Health Grant from the Port of Long Beach to address high rates of asthma in the Port's northernmost catchment area. Based on experience, Pools of Hope has determined the need for a dedicated Coordinator to conduct RHIP outreach and education. The Coordinator will increase awareness of asthma triggers (mold, pests, smoking), teach medication adherence, and provide monitoring tools. As a community-based, nonprofit organization, Pools of Hope works continually to address emerging needs and develop aquatic, therapeutic, rehabilitative and recreational programs that will improve physical, mental and social well-being for North Long Beach, Compton and Paramount residents.",

In 2019, the American Fitness Index ranked Long Beach with the worst air quality in the nation, in a comparison of 100 large cities. Poor air pollution from port traffic, refineries, factories, heavily trafficked roads and environmental hazards are bombarding residents. Approximately 100 individuals for every 10,000 accessed emergency department services for asthma in the years 2015-2017. It is safe to assume the numbers continue to increase with pollutants and fires. The threat is multi-generational, as families tend to stay in the area and their children have children living in the same region, breathing the same conditions.",

We maximize our resources and partnerships to promote inclusivity, understanding and growth. The RHIP pilot proved successful in reaching school-aged children where they learn and play. We partner with Long Beach, Paramount, and Compton Unified School Districts to bring a mobile unit directly to schools for asthma screenings. This reduces barriers of cost, transportation and insurance for at-risk, socio-economically disadvantaged families. In 2022, we received renewed funding from a Port of Long Beach Community Health Grant to continue the project through 2024. We are partnering with the St. Mary Medical Center to utilize their Mobile Unit to provide screenings on-site at our facility and local schools. The proposed project would expand the reach of RHIP by adding a Pools of Hope staff position to coordinate this important program.",

The camp will include: Training sessions in an engineering and architecture lab; mentor sessions from ACE leaders; a visit to a construction site and opportunity to see ACE leaders in action; concluding with a Think-A-Thon where girls work together on an ACE project, present to a judging panel comprised of ACE leaders. DemoChicks (DC) On-Line: In 10 monthly sessions, girls (7-13) receive and apply hands-on instruction in ACE concepts. Sessions include an active ACE professional who shares about their career journey and the concepts they use daily. The session ends with the girls constructing a demolition ball model or conducting a chemical reaction using items that every home typically has or supplies shipped from DC. These sessions allow the girls to apply concepts learned and envision themselves as capable ACE leaders. Unlike most STEM education which focuses broadly on these concepts, DemoChicks uniquely focuses on architecture, construction, and engineering (ACE) which are critical fields to address homelessness and the climate emergency via building decarbonization and increasing housing density to lessen sprawl that causes driving-led carbon emissions.

Roughly 1 in 3 homeless individuals are women. Overrepresented in poverty, women of color are underrepresented in high-wage STEM fields nationally. Latina/Black/Indigenous women comprise 17% of the US population, but only 14% of STEM degrees. Women earn 57% of bachelor's degrees in all fields, yet only 22%- Engineering, 21%-Physics, and 20%-Computer Science degrees. Women make ~$15,000 less than men in STEM fields; Latina/Black women make ~$33,000 less. Women comprise 48% of the workforce, but only 34%-STEM, 26%-computer/math workforce, and 16%-engineering. DemoChicks disrupts these statistics via education, mentorship, and exposure for girls/women to pursue high-earning careers. We also address disparities shown by COVID19 of Black women and Latinas’ concentration in low-wage, service jobs, which contributed to high rates in communities of color.",

From seeing women who mirror their backgrounds and identities, we hope our participants gain the belief that they can capably and competently enter and succeed in these fields. From the friendships forged with peers and mentors, we hope that girls and women have supportive colleagues and cheerleaders who they rely on for advice and encouragement. Our long-term vision is that our efforts change L.A. County’s disheartening statistics about women’s entrenched poverty. In 2017 L.A. County reported that “More than 41,000 domestic violence-related calls for assistance were made by women.” Since a woman’s ability to flee domestic violence is influenced by financial stability, economic empowerment is essential to a woman’s safety.

Youth ages 17-19 transitioning out of foster care have the highest pregnancy risks; a 300% increase during this time period (Oshima, Narendorf & McMillen, 2013). In California, teenage girls in foster care are five times more likely to become pregnant than their peer group in mainstream society. They are also at greater risk of contracting STD's (Campa, Leff & Tufts, 2018). Nearly 13 million newly diagnosed STD's were reported among youth ages 15 - 24 (CDC, 2021). 60k pregnancies were terminated in this age group (CDC, 2019). They generally live without guidance. Unintended pregnancies impede their self-development and economic opportunities. They lack self-regulation and emotional intelligence which leads to poor decision making and it compromises their mental wellbeing (Salazar et al 2016).",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "I've prepared for success with five years of research regarding foster youth. Working with universities, NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness), drug rehabilitation centers & community key opinion leaders. I've learned that emotional intelligence reduces maladaptive behavior. Research proves that even employers value these qualities. The World Economic Forum reported that by 2020, emotional intelligence would be the sixth most required skill of the workforce. Increasing the foster youth’s ability to acquire gainful employment can decrease homelessness and criminal activity.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "South LA residents have a deep commitment to improving community safety in their own neighborhoods, and have organized alongside CoCo for over three decades to shift social/economic conditions that facilitate violence/crime. Founded in 1990 during the height of the crack-cocaine epidemic, CoCo sought to advance non-punitive community safety models during a period when addiction was met with devastating levels of criminalization and incarceration. The legacy of the drug crisis, as well as the impacts of chronic disinvestment, are deeply felt in South LA to this day. 41.6% of South LA residents live below the Federal Poverty Line, and poverty and crime have been exacerbated due to the disproportionate harms of COVID-19. CoCo knows that crime goes up when communities are hurting and lack access to equitable resources/supports. Therefore, CoCo invests in community safety models that are grounded in addressing critical deficiencies in the social safety net and greater landscape.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "CoCo and South LA residents have a long legacy of utilizing grassroots organizing to advance equity that benefits historically disenfranchised communities. Together they have secured more than $14B in critical wins for South LA residents and people all across the region. Through advancing on-going grassroots efforts that improve community safety in South LA, CoCo’s vision of success would include the training and leadership development of 300 residents who will utilize their skills to make LA County a place that values all residents. Residents will be engaged in ongoing efforts that address nuisance sites and blight in their communities, increase park safety, and facilitate engagement with key stakeholders around investments in resources and programming that cumulatively facilitate improved community safety. The effort would center residents of South LA in impact, but would have far-reaching influence in the LA region at large.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "CoCo is enthused to submit this proposal to the Goldhirsh Foundation for $75,000 in support of its Grassroots Organizing program, a proven and researched strategy that creates opportunities for historically marginalized communities to improve quality of life in their own communities. As aligned with the priority of making Los Angeles a better place to play, a partnership with the Goldhirsh Foundation would be pivotal to maintaining and expanding resident-led, reimagined community safety efforts. Grassroots leaders promote community safety via: Nuisance Abatement: Residents steward crime prevention through leading nuisance abatement work, which addresses the over-concentration of nuisance sites (unlicensed liquor stores, smoke shops, and marijuana dispensaries) that act as hotspots for crime/public safety risks. Bolstering the Social Safety Net: It is a well known fact that access to resources is a deterrent to crime and can help lift families out of devastating material situations. Thus, residents are trained as leaders to engage and advocate for the resources and programming needed to help make communities safe and whole. Park Equity/Built Environment/Land Use: Residents organize to get parks resourced, and build partnerships with entities like Advocates 4 Peace & Urban Unity (APUU), who help increase South LA residents’ safe access to parks/open spaces via the integration of gang interventionists and community stakeholders."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "LASA begins with a three-day intensive in the summer where in-coming juniors from across the county - and all kinds of school arrangements - meet each other and begin to share their stories. The first three days of learning routinely tackle water - historical questions about access and development, current infrastructural issues, and environmental concerns. They meet with experts and, when conditions permit, visit a Metropolitan Water District treatment and testing facility. From there, students meet one Saturday a month to take on additional topics. LASA has been doing this work since 2012 and continues to build and evolve. The groups of high school juniors change year to year and graduate into a growing group of LASA alums. Yearly, we add new schools and cover new neighborhoods. We have a community of experts who work with us to guide, mentor, and support the students. The issues we address, and the experts we invite, are constantly evaluated to be responsive to the moment while still addressing longer range infrastructural concerns. LASA plans to build on this foundation and expand its impact as the program and personnel (and students) evolve and change and as our alumni network grows over time. We have already seen tangible results in terms of alumni involvement. As only a single example, we have funded a student pursuing independent research on food insecurity this summer; he is being mentored by a former LASA student who is now employed by a regional food coalition.",

When we launched LASA more than a decade ago, we had a vision that, someday before long, LASA graduates would be professionally involved in civic service across the LA Basin. That these young people might choose professional directions in part because of this program was thrilling to contemplate. Today, we have proof-of-concept data that points to this hope and this vision. But our dreams about LASA run deeper than the joy of seeing this or that graduate find work and fulfillment in civic and civil service. What is now even more exciting to ponder (and hope for) is that LASA graduates would find problem-solving connections across sectors, that their history of civic engagement from the time that they were sixteen years old, will pay hopeful and helpful dividends years later.

We look for reports on realizations and discoveries based on LASA participation, increased engagement in the areas they individually are most drawn to, and reflections on both the state of their neighborhoods and possibilities for the future. Longer term gains are measured in alumni feedback on choices for majors based on LASA experiences and career developments. The broader impact of LASA is inseparable from the specific aspects of the future our students choose to address. They have decided to study environmental studies and engineering based on their experiences in LASA. With each class, we hear of those drawn to law enforcement, public health, and history. While our mission is to serve LASA students, we also see their impact on the experts and institutions they visit based on their questions and concerns.",

They act as home bases, as well as archival and personnel sources. Through our ties to USC, we draw academic and other partners into LASA's programs; we also bring collegiate and admissions counselors into direct dialogue with our students. The Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) is our downtown home base, and students are made aware of that institution's young adult and tutoring programs - as well as their critical work in serving those experiencing homelessness. The Huntington is LASA's primary base of operations; we introduce students to that institution's mission, curatorial personnel and collections, and Huntington education/outreach programs are brought to LASA attention throughout any given year's work.",

LASA provides an experiential learning experience at an early enough age to encourage future careers in the public sector. LASA works with high school juniors to give them the foundational knowledge and tools to address numerous issues across the county. LA's students are experts in the realities their neighborhoods and families face. They have ideas for civic improvement and the future. LASA responds to the need to provide understandings of how the county works now and the need to have a county-wide discussion about the differences in lived experiences.

She got her green card in 2021 and we petitioned to bring her two sons to the US. They were reunited in 2022. Aurora volunteers as a mentor to recently arrived asylees and shares this reflection: “My whole world broke into a thousand pieces; I was alone, in a country that was not mine, without speaking the language, without money, and very desperate. That is when I had the miracle of meeting the wonderful team of AOL, who not only gave me all the legal support but also became my family in the U.S. They never left me alone and gave me their love and moral support that made my days more bearable.”",

While immigrants clearly make up a large portion of LA’s population, they remain an untapped civic force; in 2016, an estimated 768,000 individuals were eligible to naturalize but had not yet done so, thus making them unable to vote or engage in other civic participation. One barrier to engagement is language: about 30 percent of all immigrant-headed households are linguistically isolated, defined as having no member age 14 or older who speaks English at least “very well.” Regarding social support, LA has one of the largest immigrant populations in California but coverage in terms of immigrant-serving organizations is less robust compared to other counties: there are three such organizations per 100,000 individuals in LA County compared to ten organizations per 100,000 non-citizen immigrants in Alameda County."

Between Nov. 2021 - April 2022, the out-of-stock rate jumped to 31% from between 2 and 8% in the first half of 2021. This also impacts young children with food allergies. The factors that contribute to Black women's low breastfeeding rate are manifold, complex and interconnected. They include race-targeted marketing, unequal distribution of resources for new mothers and historical and present discrimination. Underlying these factors is the symbiotic relationship between the US government and formula corporations. Even as women face pressure to breastfeed during the formula shortage, Black women confront counterpressure and less support.",

Between 2020-2022, 89.4% of our clients reported at least a 25% increase in savings, 89.3% of individuals improving their credit score by at least 35 points, 85.4% number of individuals with at least 25% reduction in debt, and 79% of individuals set and completed a 6-month long financial goal. Kaimore placed 102 out of 138 individuals enrolled in our workforce development programs into jobs despite the pandemic. The metrics we use to measure impact include: documenting number of unduplicated at-risk families enrolled, analysis of client changes in financial wellbeing as measured by the pre- and post- service survey, employment rate, and 3-6 months job retention rate.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Over 9 million American households lack a bank account. Some 60 million adults use high-cost lending products, around half of whom are African Americans and Latinos, despite qualifying for standard loan products. Households with poor credit history and lack of emergency savings will spend nearly 10% of their income on high-cost credit products. Debts disproportionately impact families and communities of color, hindering economic mobility. Unemployment and increased cost of living further exacerbate financial stability. Kaimore serves Los Angeles’s most vulnerable populations: unhoused, Transitional Aged Youth, and clients accessing food assistance to provide comprehensive financial capability services. For this project, Kaimore seeks to address income inequality. Participants will learn about banks, mortgages, loans, retirement accounts from skilled and experienced trainers. Re-employment, job retention, and financial literacy will be crucial to rebuilding LA in the coming years.",

The Journal of Pediatrics found that kids who grew up in the foster care system experience preventable, chronic health problems like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma at a rate significantly higher than the general population, including among low-income individuals who did not grow up in foster care. Young people in foster care lack autonomy in food preparation. Though nutritious food is a vital preventive health resource, how and what foster youth eat depends on their agency’s priorities. They rarely receive guidance on how to prepare and shop for nutritious meals on a budget.

Since the program’s launch, 6,500 students at the 3 COS sites have received new, athletic shoes. We anticipate the opening of our fourth site to take place during the Fall 2022 semester. Our goal is to continue to open shoe banks across LAUSD to serve the immediate needs of students. At each of our shoe banks, we provide a size run of shoes based on the number of students and age range to ensure that there will be enough of each size.

When in doubt, they have a strong support system they can reach out to for guidance. MENTOR is a well rounded approach to self-sufficiency. To ensure safety, impact and the ability for our community's parents to be employed and efficient knowing their children are safe, our Transporation program offers safe passage from school to site for more than 180 youth. Proven programs address healthy lifestyle choices and a plan towards self-sufficiency. MENTOR's A-G: A-Academic enrichment with a focus on STEAM, Anti-Bullying and Acknowledgement through merit rewards; B-Buddies and mentors at four levels, peer, staff, college and corporate; C-Character building, Cultural appropriateness and Community Service; D-Diversity/Inclusion and Dealing With Your Feelings coursework; E-Electives within core tenets: The Arts, Athletics, Health and Life Skills; Leadership and Career/Job Readiness; F-Family, Finance, Field Trips, Food & Fitness; G-Goals for Graduation and Gender specific programs",

Many are forced to live far from where they work, creating long car commutes and congestion, and aggravating our climate crisis. The cause of this supply shortage? Old zoning laws that no longer address our needs—laws that make it difficult and expensive to build housing in LA. Red tape and city rules eat up much of a project’s budget, and neighbors often fight projects, driving up costs. One of the biggest cost drivers: rigid parking minimums—despite the fact that many Angelenos don’t drive. And there are others—like heavy carrying costs (because projects take so long to get approved and complete) and frivolous lawsuits (which our zoning laws invite). These expenses drive up the cost to build homes, so that few projects pencil out. The result: only big developers can afford to build—and they only want to do big, expensive projects.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The LCI is a grassroots advocacy campaign. The goal: persuade elected officials across LA County to rezone our cities to enable 1) increased housing supply, 2) greater housing density, 3) more affordable living, and 4) easier, greener mobility. The proposed rezoning will transform commercial corridors into safe, livable, sustainable communities. These new neighborhoods will have warm, human-scale architecture reflecting community-approved designs. The LCI plan is an innovative solution that will: *Create new urban living experiences: mixed-use buildings (up to 5 stories) on walkable, bikeable streets. *Remove parking minimums, enabling small buildings on narrow lots. *Establish “by right” development code to speed approvals & end lawsuits. *Reduce onerous fees & add guardrails to protect small builders. *Have pre-approved plans chosen by the community. By removing excess fees, red tape, delays, and risk, this will democratize building and break up our big-developer monopoly. It will empower and incentivize local builders to make small buildings with affordable units on narrow lots. Unlike other attempts to address the housing crisis, it’s a market-driven approach—but with small businesses leading the way. To persuade officials to enact this rezoning, we’ll: *Build consensus among residents via grassroots outreach. *Engage technical experts to evolve our solution. *Develop literature to educate stakeholders. *Engage in deep dialogue with elected officials in LA County.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Imagine living in an exciting, buzzing neighborhood—one with inviting, human-scale buildings, charming residential units perched above locally-owned businesses, wide sidewalks, and safe bike lanes—all under lush tree canopies. Imagine not needing a car because everything’s right there: *Outdoor dining *Markets *Your friends *Your work *Fast transit Imagine this community being affordable for ordinary working folks. If we can persuade officials to implement the LCI plan, it'll transform LA County’s underused commercial corridors to vibrant new communities. The benefits: *Greater affordability & reduced homelessness—due to more supply. *Better quality of life—with complete, walkable neighborhoods. *Greater equity—by reversing displacement & increasing affordability. *More mobility options—walking, biking, transit, & more. *Reduced climate impact—because car-free living is the best thing we can do to save our planet. *Less traffic—because people can live near their jobs (or transit)."

Currently, the area is weed-infested dirt, with gopher-holes, blowing litter/trash and no trees or plants, yet it lies at the heart of the housing development. The area is adjacent to a community softball field, and our plans for this greenspace pocket-park are inspired by the new gardens designed at Dodger Stadium by landscape manager, Chaz Perea. His vision was to introduce fans to the beauty of California native plants. We want to do the same with Unity Park in Watts. Unity Park will be our second greenspace in Imperial Courts. Our first is Unity Gardens, a one-year, $30K renovation of a 2,500 sq ft community garden, completed March 2022. It’s a short walk from the Unity Park site and began with an extensive cleanup, removing 40 bags of garbage and weeds. With community leaders, we designed a new garden, installed solar-powered irrigation and planted over 80 native plants to attract pollinators.

Parents tell us they love seeing their kids play in the safety of the Unity Garden, instead of on the streets. Kids tell us the best part is seeing butterflies in person for the first time, collecting rolly-polly bugs, and tasting cucumbers and snap peas right off the vines.

Nowhere is this more critical and more complicated than in LA Public Housing in Watts. Like many urban renewal projects in '40s, the Imperial Courts Project in Watts was designed with hardscape playgrounds and sports courts but little attention to greenspaces. Today the few grass areas are now weed-infested, dirt and liter wastelands; the nearest park requires crossing train tracks and rival gang territories to get there; and many trees planted in 1944 were cut down after the 1965 Watts Riots for LAPD helicopter visibility and never replaced. Due to strict public housing rules, residents are not permitted to plant gardens. And it’s cost-prohibitive for Housing Authority to create greenspaces with their aging building maintenance issues and limited budgets.

Thus many hard-working and responsible single parents struggle to make ends meet, and a significant portion of America’s youth is being raised in poverty. And economic opportunity, or lack thereof, is understood to be the largest indicator of a child’s future success. Making matters worse— it’s expensive to be poor.

This will also increase the standard of living for a significant portion of our nation’s youth, promoting individual prosperity concurrent with societal benefit. We intend to focus on 3 categories: 1. Rent— A co-signer would strengthen rental applications for single parents, so that they can equitably compete for affordable quality housing. This helps them to obtain housing in areas with lower crime rates, less sex offenders, and higher quality schooling. 2. Home buying—Co-signing on home purchases would allow single parents to obtain housing in desirable areas while often paying less each month than they would pay to rent. This also increases their tax savings and quality of life, while also building personal security and individual wealth. 3. Car Purchase - Having a co-signer would allow applicants to qualify for better interest rates when purchasing a car and/or lower payments when leasing. This amounts to significant monthly savings."

Racial disparities also exist. Although 24% of STEM workers are women, only 4% are women of color. These disparities exist in fields where STEM and the arts intersect as well. In architecture, women make up 17% of the field, where only 11% are a racial minority. Similar disparities are seen in gaming, graphic design, cinematography, and so on. The underfunding of arts education in public schools contributes to the underrepresentation of people of color in creative arts. More than 80% of LAUSD’s students are children of color, and with 80% of students at or below the poverty line, many do not have access to an arts education that would help them compete for jobs in the creative arts industries.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 700",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Grant funding will address both the overall gender gap in STEM and the more specific lack of representation in the STEM-related creative arts and entertainment fields -- both fields that are high-profile and integral to Los Angeles. First, by supporting GALA's overall operations, the grant will allow GALA to continue its groundbreaking work educating diverse girls in STEM in a public school setting. All-girls models have been shown to be highly effective educational models particularly for girls of color, and they graduate girls interested in STEM majors at a six times higher rate than co-ed schools do. Supporting GALA helps the school feed more girls into the STEM pipeline. Second, this grant will enhance GALA's arts curriculum so that girls can explore the interplay of the creative arts and STEM. Additional funding will create additional sections of architecture and graphic design, and add new classes in music production, game design, and art history. The program will also enable students to use film and video throughout the school as a tool for storytelling and showing mastery in class subjects. Grant funding will also be used to connect the school to graduate students and professionals working in the creative arts and entertainment fields so that GALA can leverage the resources that only Los Angeles can offer. On-campus workshops, mentorships, and internships will expose students to these fields and increase access to the creative arts and entertainment fields.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "K-12 STEAM Education",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "GALA can measure the impact of its single-gender STEM-focused curriculum. First, all three of GALA's graduating classes have a a 100% graduation and college acceptance rate, and the percentage of graduates intending to major in STEM fields is at least double the national rate. Second, student success stories are inspiring, and demonstrate the real-life impact that a public school can have on ambitious girls who have an interest in STEM. (We can provide stories on request.) GALA’s creative arts curriculum is not yet as established as its more traditional STEM curriculum, and so GALA does not yet have clear impact measurements. However, as the program grows and the students who enjoyed the arts curriculum graduate, GALA can track who chooses to study creative arts after high school. To assess the impact of its efforts to build relationships with industry professionals, GALA will track the number of events, mentorships, and internships that come about from its efforts."

    "organization": "Bridge Builders Foundation",
    "summary": "Expand current elementary and middle school out-of-school program to add a comprehensive high school component. Current program has provided eight months of exposure to a wide range STEAM subjects for elementary and middle school students of color for over 10 years. Our objective is to establish an elementary to college pipeline of out-of-school STEAM instruction and exposure. These funds will be used to plan, build, and execute that comprehensive out-of-school STEAM program for high school boys and girls of color.",
    "goal": "LEARN",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Outcomes for our STEM program are measured primarily through quantitative pre-post test on lesson plan content, which are administered before and after each class session. The tests measure subject knowledge gain using a standardized knowledge gain formula. Desired outcome is that students will show a minimum knowledge gain of 30 percent. The test also can show instructor effectiveness. Pre-post qualitative STEM interest surveys also are administered at beginning and end of program year. Additionally, a parent and student satisfaction survey is administered at end of each annual program",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our vision for this program is that more students of color will be influenced to pursue STEAM careers, addressing the current under representation. This also will influence improvements in their math and science performance in school. Non-Asian students of color are currently performing at the bottom of the achievement scale in math and science in LAUSD. A STEAM career motivation will show increased incentive for these subjects. The program also will be able to address the issue of supporting an out-of-school STEAM pipeline (elementary through high school) and prep for college STEAM majors. Los Angeles County will be different in that school performance for minorities will improve and the economic station of this key sector of the population will improve as they become a part of the STEAM industry, which is experiencing the highest income growth compared to other sectors of the economy",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In the past several decades, fewer young people, both minority and non-minority have chosen to start on the pathway to science or engineering careers. As the demand for young people prepared to work in America’s high technology industries has increased, the pool of prepared young people has decreased. This erosion of technological capacity significantly impacts our nation’s ability to remain competitive and economically viable. Of particular concern are women and minorities, who have traditionally been significantly underrepresented in STEM disciplines, especially non-Asian minorities. The disparity of representation is particularly alarming given the demographic changes occurring in the United States. According to the US Census Bureau, by the year 2050, underrepresented minority groups will constitute nearly 50% of the US college-aged population. These numbers emphasize the need to allocate resources to expand the pool of qualified STEM prepared students to women and minorities.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our current E. E. Just Youth Science Program exposes students to a wide range of STEAM topics through two separate programs - the Saturday Science Academy and the Summer Marine Science Camp. The Saturday Science Academy annually consists of two Saturday sessions per month from January thru July. The first Saturday generally is classroom instruction where the students receive classroom instruction on a designated STEAM topic. On the second Saturday, the students typically have a field trip to a science related field location to expand and deepen their classroom learning with real-world experience. The annual program consists of seven STEAM subjects drawn from a master program curriculum. Class instruction is provided by a combination of professors from colleges and STEAM companies across Los Angeles. The Summer Marine Science Camp is conducted over three consecutive weekends in August and includes five venues across Southern California with the third weekend consisting of a 3-day, 2- night stay in college dormitories at Catalina Island includes. Our proposed high school track will be consistent with our current program except that the curriculum will provide more extended exposure to three to four topics. For example, one STEAM topic for two to three consecutive Saturdays for more in-depth treatment with a single field trip for each topic. The Marine Science component will be a separate 3-day weekend of marine science classroom and exploration at Catalina.",

It is specifically designed to treat trauma injuries during active shooter/multi-casualty incidents, but can also be used for earthquakes, lost/injured hikers, cliff rescues, or any situation where trauma injuries are the primary concern for the patient. This backpack allows LAFD to treat patients quickly and effectively due to its easy portability and ease of use. Unfortunately, some of the contents have passed the viable shelf life & require replacement, which is outside the City’s budget at this time. The highest priority items for replacements are the Quick Clot Combat Gauze (expired in 2017), and the Russel Chest Seal (expired in 2019). Although these two items are currently expired, they can still be used and have remained in service. However, the efficacy of the items becomes greatly reduced as time goes on. For example, the chest seals use an adhesive that allows the product to be placed over a sucking chest wound, and as time goes on past the expiration date the seals’ adhesive properties will begin to fail potentially leading to an increased risk of injury or death for a patient. The Quick Clot gauze is impregnated with a hemostatic agent that helps the body produce clots faster, this hemostatic agent becoming degraded over time which can lead to poor patient outcomes.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Community Safety",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Replacing these vital medical supplies could be the difference between life and death for any Angeleno during an emergency. In 2021 the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to 1,429 assault firearm incidents that resulted in 1,524 patients. There were also 1,183 assault stabbing incidents that resulted in 1,223 patients. Even a single patient who suffers a penetrating trauma injury like those caused by a gunshot or stabbing can benefit from the use of these medical items. When hemostatic gauze or a chest seal device is needed, it is potentially lifesaving. The goal is to prepare our LAFD paramedics as well as possible and ensure they have everything they need when an emergency strikes.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "City of Los Angeles",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Unfortunately, firearm deaths have become a fixture in American life. There have already been more than 250 mass shootings this year in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Thirty-eight have taken place since a rampage at an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex., left 19 children and two teachers dead on May 24. Mass shootings, where four or more people — not including the shooter — are injured or killed, have averaged more than one per day so far this year. Not a single week in 2022 has passed without at least four mass shootings. With these devastating statistics, we need to ensure Los Angeles is as prepared as possible for a mass shooting. An important step in this preparation is ensuring our City’s firefighters and paramedics has the proper supplies they need to treat victims.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "According to a 2015 Mayo Clinic study, QuikClot Combat Gauze “is highly successful at stopping bleeding, with 59 of 62 injuries (95%) achieved hemostasis.” When EMTs arrive on the scene of an emergency that involves people who are bleeding, the most important task is to stop the bleeding. This gauze allows them to do that effectively. The Russell Chest Seal has also been thoroughly tested and proven on military operations and adheres effectively to skin. It is tested and proven to remain adhered over many hours and is comfortable for the patient in prolonged use. The LAFD maintains metrics on responses to all incidents and rate-of-use of supplies. Success will be proven through amount of lives saved with these supplies over the course of its duration in the field."

We are seeking to address outcomes like 1) 40% end up in jail, homeless, or dead within three years, 2) foster youth are 3-5 times more likely to die by suicide than same-age peers, and 3) 25% suffer from PTSD. The societal cost of foster care–state and federally–exceeds $9 billion annually under just title IV-E of the Social Security Act. The ongoing impact of trauma is particularly debilitating given their abrupt independence upon aging out. Unaddressed, it can lead to a range of challenges negatively affecting their self-management, responsible decision-making, and self/social awareness. We must address their feelings, and the systemic problems of the child welfare system, because the painful outcomes to these potential changemakers is unacceptable. Our art therapy approach provides a healthy outlet for expressing/releasing the traumas the youth have experienced.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Creating artistic openings for foster youth to be seen, heard, validated, celebrated, and employed combats the barriers they currently face. Providing a platform for youth to create content, KITS offers a lifeline to those who often feel overlooked and devalued. KITS’ Script-to-Screen program spotlights Black and brown foster youth ages 12-22 who write, cast, and star in their own short films. The program year culminates in the annual KITS Film Awards (KFA), where their films and talents are showcased for the public—including industry insiders and decision makers who can hire them. The KFA offers our youth the Academy Award-worthy treatment they deserve (glam squads, suits/gowns, limos, red carpet, celebrity presenters) where our youth take center stage in the spotlight. After their films are screened, awards for best ensembles, screenplays, actors, and films are announced. With a platform to shine, the transformation of our opportunity youth takes place. Screenwriting gives them agency and decision-making power. Acting gives them a safe outlet to express themselves. The KFA restores hope through giving foster youth an audience who helps carry the weight of what they’ve endured alone. With the help of LA2050, KITS will further magnify the impact of our youths’ films and grow their opportunities for creative industry employment through having a professional film crew capture the event and package it for distribution to a television audience—like the Teens Choice Awards.",

However, the KFA lends itself to qualitative feedback as the youth give speeches sharing what the experience means to them. In 2021, one teen expressed gratitude as the patrons bore witness to her mom’s story, which in effect, is her story too. Separated from her mom due to incarceration, she and her group wanted to create a film that encouraged their peers to stop gang violence in their L.A. community. A transitional age foster youth said, “I’m glad to be a part of KITS. Being in this program has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made!

We housed 26 people in 2021, 13 in independent housing and 13 in bridge housing. Five of those in bridge housing have moved to permanent housing, four are waiting for housing inspections before moving into permanent housing and four continue case management while housing is located.

It takes multiple attempts over extended periods of time to engage them and build rapport leading to a trusting relationship that can facilitate addressing immediate needs and the development of a housing plan. Although 250-300 people are annually navigated into permanent housing in Pasadena, the number of people experiencing homelessness each year at the time of the Pasadena Homeless Count remains steady with 53% having been on the streets for more than one year. We will not eliminate homelessness in Pasadena until we are able to serve and permanently house the chronically homeless.",

To increase our impact on chronic homelessness, we plan to add two experienced street outreach workers to the team in the fall of 2022. The SOHP team meets weekly for case conferencing around individuals with whom meaningful connections have been made. Not everyone is interested in being housed, and some who are, may not be ready for a variety of reasons. Clients determined by the team to be housing-ready are offered comprehensive case-management and motel stays while being navigated into permanent or bridge housing (bridge housing programs continue case-management until permanent housing can be found). Other clients are walked through the process of becoming housing ready. Although different for each person, this may entail overcoming fear of social services, accessing personal documents for government assistance, and referrals to agencies that treat mental health, physical health and/or addiction issues. Once housing roadblocks are removed, clients are placed in a motel to begin navigation until housing is located."

County, only 15% are enrolled in a top public school, meaning 85% receive an education that does not close the achievement gap. The Rebel Garden Project (RGP) addresses the root cause of these inequities by striving to empower BIPOC, systems-impacted youth with access to educational resources, sustainable and creative opportunities, and eventually, careers. Another problem RGP confronts is the food system in South L.A. by teaching youth to grow fresh produce to nourish themselves and their community. RGP practices a shared leadership model that respects the power and autonomy of BIPOC youth/system-impacted folks in working together to challenge the systems of oppression impacting these communities.",

RGP's programming model combats this by engaging and empowering youth and key residents of South L.A. at all levels of program design and implementation, from centering the voices of our BIPOC participants and leaders to sharing resources and support. A successful program would mean graduating at least 20 interns, empowered with new skills brought forth through our intersectional curriculum that focuses on resource sharing, skill-building and accessibility. Another successful guidepost would be the creation of a Rebel Garden Farmers Market, to help increase access to fresh, locally-sourced produce, nourish the South Los Angeles community, and improve its climate resilience in the process.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Rebel Garden Project (RGP) is a food justice and urban gardening internship for youth in South Los Angeles. RGP was created in partnership with the Youth Justice Coalition and students from FREE L.A. High School, an alternative school program for systems-impacted teens and young adults. The Rebel Garden itself began as 3 small, raised planter beds in a parking lot in 2019, as a side project of FREE L.A. students and community members. In 2021, RuckusRoots was invited to offer arts and ecology programming to help the garden's caretakers engage more FREE L.A. students and achieve their goals for the garden. We called our pilot program The Rebel Garden Project (RGP), which launched in March, 2022. Students received hands-on experience with local artists and master gardener Kimble Deleon, learning the fundamentals of urban gardening as well as visual arts lessons. Together we built more gardening beds, created artistic signage, a greenhouse, a native pollinator garden, and a drip irrigation system. Our proposed project is continuation and expansion of RGP, allowing us to build upon learnings and outcomes of the pilot, and achieve more community-driven goals for the space. In this round, our emerging gardeners will also receive entrepreneurial training in areas that combine both gardening and business development in order to start a local farmers market that sells produce and seeds from The Rebel Garden itself.",

    "summary": "We build solutions that provide timely visual information on wildfires because we care about protecting communities and saving lives. Delphire has developed a functional multi-sensor wildfire detection prototype that can operate in areas with no cell service to detect electric grid-related wildfires and report them along with a “selfie” for confirmation. This later point is critical for prioritization of the CalFire sub-20-minute aerial tanker response time across California. These planes cannot afford to chase false positives.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "This grant will help support our pilot efforts that are ongoing or developing. Currently, through the support of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI), we are about to launch a pilot that tests our units with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) as an advisor. This grant would allow us to deploy additional test units to validate our model. Possible sites for these units include Pasadena, a location near the recent Emerald Fire, and additional test units on the LACI LKCI roof. Any additional test sites that the challenge can help us secure would be welcome. The purpose of these additional locations is to grow our sensor network and begin to demonstrate the power that a larger network can bring to data modeling for predicting where the fire will likely spread from any given location.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Delphire brings the electric utilities a novel solution for their wildfire problem. Our technology uses visual edge AI monitoring below the tree canopy along their transmission lines’ right of way to catches fires early, during their incipient phase, to prevent the most damage possible. We cover a critical need area where infrared satellite-based detection will be ineffective due to several factors. We expect to reduce the damage on up to 30 fires a year and prevent 5 entirely when deployed over 20,000 pole miles (1 unit/2 transmission towers) at a cost of $250M. The anticipated yearly benefits are: (1) lives saved, (2) $1.5B from reduced direct damages and firefighting costs, (3) $205M in reduced environmental damage from prevented GHG emissions, equivalent to 1 million metric tons CO2 annually.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The pilot would prove our model and put pressure on utilities to adopt our system to keep vulnerable and disadvantaged communities safe. We estimate that in California alone, an eventual high-density deployment covering 20,000 pole miles (1 unit / 2 transmission towers) of conductor at a cost of US$250 Million would result in a reduction in total burn area by 50% for 30 annual fires caught early, and 5 fires presented is equivalent to preventing 1MMT (Million Metric Tons) of CO2. The burn area damages are estimated at $1.5Bn from 35 events ($100M per fire, as most fires are under 100 acres). In addition, the environmental damage from the forest fires emissions alone would at $205M almost cover the cost of our system. These costs do not yet account for the effects of fine matter particulates on people. Our solution will help the local economies by preventing loss of life, destruction, and economic disruption from wildfires, while reducing the duration of Public Safety Power Shutoffs.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Immediate Success: Demonstrate that multiple sensor data incorporated in parallel vastly improve the ability to detect, monitor, and predict fire behavior for a single detection. Long term success: Prevention and mitigation of fires significantly benefit those underserved communities, while preserving infrastructure and reducing energy costs in the long term, also benefiting lower income individuals. Wildfires temporarily displaced over 1 million people in the US in 2020, including 600,000 in California, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged individuals and communities, from several factors including environmental effects. Delphire is not only committed to establishing a diverse team, but incentivized to do so through our contract with LACI, which significantly reduces their equity stake as we achieve specific diversity and inclusion goals. LACI has provided Delphire with diversity and inclusion training tailored to growing startups.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Birds are sensitive indicators of changes in our environment, and their health is failing. Experts around the world agree that aquatic birds are in crisis: - “Since the 1970’s, [North America] has lost 3 billion birds” (Science, 2019) - “Shorebirds, the World’s Greatest Travelers, Face Extinction” (New York Times, 2018.) The causes of this population collapse are almost all caused by humans. They include injury from fishing (hooks, nets, and lines), illegal shootings, habitat disruption and loss, starvation, pollution (including plastics, chemicals, and oil spills), and climate change. LA is especially important to hundreds of species of aquatic birds (many that are endangered or threatened) because of its central location on the Pacific Flyway: a major North-South migratory route along the coasts of North and South America. Immediate human impact here has concentrated, long-term effects on the global wildlife population.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "At Los Angeles Wildlife Center, we rescue and rehabilitate an average of 1,500 native aquatic birds each year, and release them back into the wild. Since our inception, we have rescued and rehabilitated over 160,000 wild animals, representing over 115 different species. As a \"referral hospital,\" we treat the most challenging injury cases that are beyond the capacity or skills of other regional wildlife centers and clinics. While many of our environmental partners focus on systemic issues such as habitat loss/conservation, we provide equally important, immediate, and present day responses that mitigate human impact and quite literally save and improve the lives of individual animals. Each case we treat is a step away from the negative effects of human impact and activity, and towards restoring biologicl diversity and balance to our local, regional, and global ecosystem. A core objective of this program is to give each injured bird the individualized care it needs to heal. This philosophy and value, that \"Each Bird Is Important,\" has been a guiding principle of our work for decades and is beautifully explained by former Executive Director, the late Jay Holcomb, in the 2011 Emmy Award-winning documentary film \"Saving Pelican 895,\" \"Populations are made up of individuals, and if you start looking at individuals as if they're not important, then ultimately the population becomes unimportant.\"",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Throughout a patient's time with us, from their initial triage assessment to their release, we record data using RaptorMed software. Treated birds are banded and can be tracked in the wild by other scientists, volunteers, and enthusiasts, and in case a treated bird returns to us for further care. We are one of the few organizations that possess the federal permit to band birds. Birds successfully rehabilitated are given “second chances” and return to a normal life. They participate in normal species behavior, such as producing and rearing offspring. Each of these outcomes is an important component of a balanced, diverse ecosystem. Our scientific data provides strong evidence that birds injured by human impact that we successfully rehabilitate (whether the impact is from oil, pollution, or other forms of human-caused Human Wildlife Conflicts such as habitat loss, food scarcity, abandonment, climate change, or fishing entanglements) lead lives that are long and productive.",

Next year, LAPL will put 200+ STEAM and environmental literacy activities within reach of 4,000+ children and teens across 45 neighborhood libraries citywide. LAPL will train librarians to deliver programs using educational kits on air and bio-diversity, water quality, and light pollution. The kits will meet Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and California Department of Education content standards, so they can also circulate to teachers to use in classrooms. LAPL programs and services are always free to the public. Full STEAM’s activities promote collective work and responsibility and cultivate STEAM literacies, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. For example, an “Ozone Garden” workshop using ozone-sensitive beans helps youth see the effects of air quality on plant life. LAPL’s geographic footprint covers the city’s 502 square miles—making libraries uniquely positioned to reach people throughout our city’s diverse communities. Neighborhood Science is the best way to raise awareness about global sustainability issues because it enables youth to see the impact of these challenges up close while gaining hands-on STEAM skills. We expect that children will not only build on what they learn in the future but also go on to raise awareness about sustainability challenges to prompt interest and action among their families and communities.",

As the world warms, its impact is being felt locally—L.A. has the worst air quality in the U.S.—exacerbated by climate-related extreme heat and wildfires. And we are possibly in the worst drought the Southwest has seen in 1,200 years while going into year three of the COVID pandemic. It is easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. But, there are actions to take collectively and individually to improve outcomes long-term. The Los Angeles Public Library has a 150-year history of offering free and easy access to information and ideas. It has now made STEAM literacy a priority to increase public understanding of climate-related issues and sustainable practices to address the urgent ecological challenges and opportunities we face.",

People from all walks of life with no formal scientific training will have the foundational skills to generate and capture data to advance research and understanding of sustainability issues among science professionals and the public. Long-term, we hope youth ages 10 and older in L.A. can knowledgeably converse about sustainability issues affecting our city, nation, and planet. They will know how to describe the science behind environmental issues in their communities and the opportunities and solutions that can address those challenges. We see that knowledge translating into greater awareness and a sense of urgency for action on sustainability in all L.A. communities.

In 2018, we contracted an evaluator who gathered data from 91 librarians and 5,418 participants. Key takeaways were that LAPL’s training enabled librarians to present STEAM-related programs at their branches—90% of librarians reported it increased their confidence in offering STEAM programs and 86% gained the technical knowledge to produce STEAM activities. Librarians’ preparedness meant better learning experiences for youth. 91% of youth surveyed reported enjoying the experience of feeling like a STEM professional, 92% reported wanting to attend more STEAM library activities and 85% reported wanting to learn more technical STEM skills. As we expand the Neighborhood Science component, we will use what we learned and assess new strategies to measure impact on staff and youth.",

This grant will allow us to expand our reach and enrollment in Los Angeles by serving a younger student profile through our newly designed Bridge program. Our learner-centered college model is designed to combat the status quo college outcomes for this population of students by decreasing the time to a degree, increasing on-time graduation, and decreasing (or, in some cases, eliminating) post-graduate debt, thereby unlocking economic advancement. The Bridge program adds two new components to our core program design to meet the needs of 18-24 year olds. First, students enter the program with a cohort of peers, creating a community of support and accountability. Second, we’ve developed a highly-structured curriculum to serve as a scaffold to support the transition from high school to college learning. Bridge cohorts meet twice per week for two-hour sessions as students prepare to become self-directed learners.

Once enrolled at LACCD, only 8% percent of Black students and 10% of Latino students go on to earn an AA degree within four years of enrollment. The 4-year graduation rate at CSU Los Angeles is only 14% for Black students and 19% for Latino students. Youth in our state’s foster system enroll in college at even lower rates than their peers, and need an even more supported and flexible onramp to college. We aim to upend these trends and serve as a proof point of what’s possible for our most under-resourced youth. Our model is designed to decrease time to earning a degree and increase persistence.

We know that a college degree remains one of the surest paths to social and economic advancement; the median lifetime earnings for individuals with bachelor's degrees are twice that of those with only high school diplomas. And between 2016 and 2026, it’s projected that the number of jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree will increase by 10%. Simply put: current pathways to higher education are not equipped to address these disparities.

Many people have no awareness of what’s available and others don’t believe that they are qualified if they are working. Homeless persons and persons leaving from incarceration often don’t know where to get help. Many immigrants and refugees also either don’t know about benefits available, or are afraid of the impact of Public Charge regulations. Besides cash, food and health care benefits, many people are not aware of their rights on the workplace or with their landlords.

If we can provide our Club students with additional STEAM classes and programs, more will graduate from high school, attend college and enter more successful, well paying careers. This is especially important for our young ladies. Women make up only 28% of the workforce in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), and men vastly outnumber women majoring in most STEM fields in college. The gender gaps are particularly high in some of the fastest-growing and highest-paid jobs of the future, like computer science and engineering. LA County will benefit from ALL our youth expanding their knowledge of STEAM.",

Boys and Girls Club of San Fernando Valley program uses data from multiple sources to assess its strengths and weaknesses to continuously improve program design, outcomes, and impact. We will track average daily attendance (ADA) as well as retention (do the youth come back). Our annual evaluation process is divided into two phases: process and outcome. The process phase documents what activities were implemented and who participated in those activities. The outcome evaluation assesses what behavioral changes high-attending members accomplished. We will conduct surveys and a focus group with the youth in the programs."

Boyle Heights Beat aims to uplift youth by giving them a sense of belonging and a voice in their community. The program creates a safe learning environment where students develop leadership skills and the confidence to bring to light racial and social inequities in the neighborhood in which they live. Our students gain important analytical, research, writing, interview, leadership, community, radio broadcast and technical skills while providing a voice to a vibrant immigrant community. Through icebreakers and games, students feel comfortable and build rapport among peers and adult mentors. During their time as youth reporters, they have the opportunity to publish professional material while being mentored by industry professionals. The program equips youth to go on to four-year colleges at a much higher rate than their peers. Radio Pulso and Boyle Heights Beat alumni are better prepared for the challenges of college and the workplace as these skills are a foundation for professional pathways. Many of our former reporters have been employed by BHB and continue to give back to their community. At BHB we value the work of our students and strive to provide them with professional training so they are better equipped to navigate their future careers. We also pride ourselves in offering job opportunities for youth after completing the program, or college.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We survey youth using multiple evaluation tools and evaluate students at the beginning of the program, and then again upon completion. Our past surveys have shown ninety percent of respondents have said that their self-confidence improved and that their educational and career ambitions were heightened as a result of being in the program. In order to collect more quantitative data, this year we also implemented the Development Assets Profile (DAP) survey in order to measure social-emotional strengths and supports of young people and show their growth in these areas over time. One current reporter said, “I believe [BHB] is important for the community because it informs its community about recent events, anything that may be beneficial for others, opens opportunities for the community to speak out, and it's very informative with a lot of passion behind it.\"",

In a recent advisory the Surgeon General found that 25% of youth are experiencing depressive symptoms, and 20% are experiencing anxiety. A sense of belonging and community is one solution professionals point to in helping to address the crisis facing youth. BHB provides a safe place for youth to learn about themselves and issues facing their community, while providing a much needed news outlet in the neighborhood. Our reporters aim to “change the narrative” of their community by showcasing its distinctive traditions, history of activism, music, food and vibrant culture. In doing so, they gain important insight, feel more confident about themselves and their community, and uplift issues to the community as a whole.",

This disparity distorts representation, silences voices, and leaves far too many talented young people on the outside, looking in. Our new Center supports a growing roster of creative career development programs for highly interest-driven young people who enroll in our programs because sophisticated technology and creative tools, as well as education and training, remain out of their financial reach. Many of our students struggle with economic uncertainty, food insecurity, and pandemic-related grief. A recent Los Angeles Times’ headline sums up their top concerns: “What do L.A. students want most? Mental health help, an adult to listen, reliable tech”. Our programs and teaching pedagogy address all three. To ease the toll of pandemic-related social isolation we returned to in-person learning in July 2020.",

Our goal is to offer these, annually, in each of the County’s 5 districts to help young people identify if work in the creative sector might be a pathway of interest to them. 3)\tCertificate Programs Intensive, paid education and training that prepares young people for “above the line” opportunities, including decision-making roles that pay a living wage. 4)\tInternships Placements at large studios, small production and post-production houses, and in adjacent industries, such as advertising. With County dollars, Venice Arts is able to subsidize the first 160 hours of placement, and is working with employer partners to gain their commitment to subsidize the balance of time, and/or to commit to the hire of successful interns. Our goal is to place at least 60% of young people graduating from our Certificate programs; we also consider college-going, work, or other outcomes that help a young person move forward in their lives a success.",

We enrolled 425 young people, from all 5 of LA County’s districts in Creative Conversations; from 149 applicants we enrolled 31 in Storytelling Immersion and our Video Production & Editing Certificate program; 30 graduated. Of the latter, 22 were placed in creative sector internships. 100% were low-income; 85% BIPOC; over 40% from priority groups (unhoused, foster, justice involved); participants were evenly divided between young men and women, with 14% identifying as non-binary. We have just completed our second round, increasing training hours from 48 to 160 and paying participant stipends. Internship placement has begun and we continue to track 1st round F&DM participants' experiences in the creative workforce.

Wellness and creative entrepreneurship requires paying for education/trainings, start up capital, dedicating time and resources into developing skills and a brand, developing financial and business skills, and the ability to wait out the time it takes to build a steady clientele and/or a successful revenue model. On the clientele side, even if folks can afford wellness offerings in places like yoga studios or holistic healing centers, with few BIWOC+ leading classes and offering services like psychotherapy and massage therapy, it is difficult for BIWOC+ to find a sense of belonging, safety, and community - keeping the pursuit of self care in LA not only expensive but exclusive and out of reach.",

Given the U.S. Department of Education’s three main levels of proficiency in math — Advanced, Proficient, and Basic — 44% of 4th grade ELs are below the Basic level. Tragically, four years later they have fallen further behind. 69% of 8th grade ELs are below the Basic level.

The importance to students of seeing this proof can’t be underestimated, especially for those who’ve spent years falling further and further behind their English-speaking peers. Math4ALL is currently accessible in 24 languages. Funding received will enable us to add 74 languages. Math4ALL currently contains 98 whole numbers topics.

Unfortunately we didn’t discover it until late in the year otherwise we would have used it immediately!” Math4ALL uses a very high-productivity, self-competition format. It’s based on the math practice software, Quarter Mile Math — used by over 1,000,000 students and adopted for use in all Sylvan Learning centers. Ms. Quarles’ comments are echoed in hundreds of testimonials Quarter Mile Math received.

In addition to maintaining our existing classes, we plan to implement workforce development certificate programs such as small business entrepreneurship, in-home support services (IHSS) provider, and CA food handler in the next year. However, the grant will primarily support a multi-generational initiative that is designed to support low-income immigrant families. We will continue to provide workshops that focus on parent-children dynamics, mental health and emotional well-being, domestic violence prevention, substance abuse counseling, resources for people with disabilities, arts, music, and culture. The initiative will also implement Spanish language classes for children and youth between the ages of 10-17 as well as a course on Latin American history. We seek to encourage 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generations and on to learn more about their culture and embrace their heritage. We strongly believe that a holistic approach is the key to addressing social issues among immigrant families.",

    "yearSubmitted": "2022",
    "organization": "Learning Rights Law Center",
    "summary": "LRLC will provide special education legal services to foster youth with disabilities who have unmet education needs. The project will ensure they receive educational and mental health services, and will interrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by securing alternatives to disciplinary proceedings and supporting youth ageing out of the foster system and transitioning to post-secondary education. In addition, LRLC will provide trainings to foster parents and advocates to support students’ education beyond their current placement.",
    "goal": "LEARN",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Foster youth face daunting challenges both within and outside of the education system. They are more likely than their peers to be chronically absent from school, and are dramatically less likely to graduate. Once out of the system at the age of 18, these youth face increased rates of homelessness and arrests. For the thousands of systems impacted youth in Los Angeles – over 8,000 youth were arrested in the county in 2018 – it is vital to intervene early in their education in order to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by reducing interactions with the justice system. For students with disabilities, this intervention takes the form of appropriate education and mental health services, particularly in lieu of disciplinary proceedings, in response to behavior that stems from unaddressed trauma or disability.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If this project is successful, LRLC will have utilized education advocacy to protect foster youth from the school to prison pipeline, and trained a cadre of foster parents to use self-advocacy to accomplish the same. A successful project will connect with other LA County aligned agencies to integrate education rights into their services. This may exist as referrals to LRLC, or as trainings to agency staff. When a student is able to graduate from high school their prospects of employment increase. If the student continues on to either higher education or a training/apprenticeship program their employment chances increase even more. While we cannot impact the number of children who enter the foster system, a successful project will reduce the number of students who become “dual-system” by additionally interacting with the justice system. Such a reduction will make a substantial and life changing difference for each child in LA County.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "To improve educational outcomes for systems impacted youth, our project will provide free legal representation to students in the foster care system and train foster parents on the education rights of students in the system so they can advocate for the children under their charge. For students receiving direct representation, LRLC will first seek educational assessments to ensure students are appropriately diagnosed and their needs are accurately identified. Subsequently, LRLC will seek educational and mental health services for the students to address all unmet needs. Our attorneys can often use previously unidentified diagnoses and a lack of services to pursue therapy and education services as an alternative to expulsion or other discipline. The project will also provide free trainings to foster parents and other education rights holders for foster youth. The trainings will equip caregivers to advocate on behalf of foster youth in the school system by familiarizing them with education law, students’ rights, and the special education identification and service delivery processes. LRLC has conducted similar trainings for low-income parents for over 15 years, and has seen thousands of families secure vital education services for their students after participating in classes. LRLC expects similar results for foster youth when caregivers are informed about their students’ education rights.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "LRLC tracks outcomes in a cloud-based database customized for legal practitioners. LRLC tracks the number of assessments secured, subsequent changes to students’ education programs, and additional educational and mental health services students will receive over the coming year. In 2021, LRLC’s education advocacy secured $3.6 million worth of free services for students with disabilities, including over 12,000 hours of tutoring and 1,500 hours of mental health services for 98 students. LRLC also secured 283 education and mental health assessments for these students, and advocated for 25 to be moved to a more appropriate education setting. For one of these students, LRLC prevented their expulsion and expunged their school record since their behavior stemmed from an untreated disability. LRLC utilizes this data to identify categories of particular need for foster youth. These findings are used to prepare the organization for better advocacy for students experiencing similar issues."

Food insecurity typically affects unhoused individuals, seniors, college/community college students, veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, single-parent households, and Black- and Latine-headed households at higher rates. At the same time, 35% of the food produced in the U.S. is unsold or uneaten. The environmental cost of food waste adds up, too: Food waste sent to landfills produces methane, a harmful greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO2 over a 20-year period. Food Forward’s produce recovery work bridges the gap between surplus fresh produce and people experiencing hunger across the region."

Shelter Partnership annually partners with well over 200 agencies directly serving people living in homelessness. This includes supportive housing sites, domestic violence shelters, foster agencies, veterans groups, and many other entities providing direct service to unsheltered L.A. residents. We provide these groups with products they and their clients need at no cost, so our partners can spend more of their time, energy, and funds on service rather than securing goods themselves.",

Our programs develop creative learning behaviors through the art of storytelling. Using group exercises and volunteer mentors, we provide young people, often those with historically marginalized identities, an opportunity to write stories and see them brought to life.

As a result, they lack the curiosity to leave their “urban village” and explore nearby neighborhoods. Those who do wish to explore the area through its architecture encounter logistical hurdles, since an online search of Los Angeles County’s residential architecture leads to a disparate collection of obscure archives. There exists no central database providing information about buildings, architects and homeowners, as well as photos, blueprints and maps of LA’s significant residences. There is no resource that links architecture – and the stories they tell through their owners and creators – together to provide narratives and connectivity across time and distance. This leaves both locals and tourists in the dark about the impact that residential architecture has had on Los Angeles’s culture and history, depriving them an opportunity to form a deeper engagement with the region.",

The app will be designed to feature FORT:LA’s award winning program, FORT: LA Trails, which highlights architecture through an easily accessible walking tour guide. A mobile app is the ideal medium for experiencing FORT:LA Trails, as it can easily synchronize the trail walking, reading, and viewing experience. Not only will users be able to experience the Trails, the app will also allow for users to listen to oral histories of homes or relevant podcasts, download maps, and watch video tours of the featured homes. FORT:LA plans to develop a visually-compelling and user-friendly design with a focus on ease of use to find Trails (via location and via search features). The app will have a thoughtful, simple, user-friendly CMS backend for non-technical editors to add content with ease. The UI/UX will be scalable, flexible, and sustainable so that it does not require frequent UI/UX updates. The app will integrate with other social platforms to maximize social engagement.

Research and narrative evidence shows that risk and protective factors overlap for all of these issues. While programs often approach these issues in silos, we are bringing together multidisciplinary research and experts to address sexual violence in a comprehensive way, strengthening approaches for other mental health and interpersonal violence concerns.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Statistics show that 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 13 boys will be sexually victimized before the age of 18. Reports show that Los Angeles County is one of the largest sex trafficking hubs in the U.S. It serves as both an entry point for victims being trafficked as well as a destination. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, almost half of human trafficking victims reported in California in recent years have been minors. Youth who are marginalized, including youth of color, low-income youth, youth who identify as LGBTQIA+, those who are experiencing homelessness and those who are involved in the foster care system, are far more likely to be impacted by sexual violence. Given this inequity, we intentionally create content for youth whose experiences are colored by intersections of gender, race, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status. We also engage children and young people in discussions about the systemic inequities that create such disparity.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Funds will be used to support 3 primary goals: -Expansion of our Teacher Training program for LAUSD with the goal of it being adopted district-wide and impacting up to 700,000 students annually. We train educators to teach the Nest prevention education to their students because the lessons are best delivered to youth by their teachers with whom they have trusted relationships. Curricula implementations teach healthy relationships, bystander behavior, and safety skills with a focus on core values that are foundational to development of protective factors for sexual violence prevention. -Piloting implementation of our Healthy Childhood Program by training elementary school counselors on the curriculum and on identifying and supporting students who may be at risk. This creates the foundational understanding and tools across the school ecosystem to teach and respond effectively to students. The more that educators are integrated into prevention work, the more effective intervention and response efforts can be. -Providing Victim Assistance for students who disclose abuse and need support by our offering direct services and acting as victim advocates. Nest will improve the outcomes of mandatory school reporting through several interventions including training in compassionate response to trusted adults and mandatory reporters, improved coordination for response efforts, and a School Reporting Policy Toolkit that streamlines reporting procedures for sexual violence and trafficking.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Nest’s programming is grounded in research-based prevention strategies. We use pre- and post-curricular surveys developed by academic collaborators as performance measures for our teacher training and school implementations. Based upon our 2020 Evaluation Report, after participating in our program, participants demonstrated statistically significant increases in: awareness of sex trafficking and empathic reactions toward victims of sex trafficking; awareness of resources that they could turn to for help; gains in the five critical components of providing bystander interventions; ability to provide bystander interventions to at-risk peers; ritical reflection (i.e., awareness and ability to think critically about societal problems) and critical media consumption (i.e., ability to be a discerning consumer of media, and to critically analyze and interrogate messages in the media/social media); and prosocial participation in their communities."

Some of the challenges refugees face are secure housing, cultural adjustment, job security, surviving on food stamps, child care, learning a foreign language, and general lack of quality socio-economic support. Ultimately, these factors have become perpetual roadblocks, trapping an entire demographic in this experience. Through our programs we have experienced our team’s struggles first-hand. Our team members from Middle Eastern countries have never been encouraged to work and now they have been forced to become the breadwinners for their families. Language barriers and transportation are factors that add to these challenges. Our LGBTQIA members are survivors that have untreated PTSD due to the violence they have endured and are unable to integrate into society. Racial discrimination in work spaces and lack of support has left many people from African communities unemployed & helpless.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "We partner with one of the largest refugee resettlement agencies in the world (International Rescue Committee) and local non-profits (Downtown Womens Center, Program For Torture Victims). These agencies connect us to new arrivals. We provide them with a 2-week training program to learn hand embroidery, and get to know our supportive Neococo environment. We offer skill building workshops, as well as an individualized supportive approach based on language proficiency, experience, or unique circumstances. Hand Embroidery is a beautiful commonality amongst many cultures around the world, and is both familiar as well as therapeutic for our team. NEOCOCO has become a mighty group of women from countries like Iran, Iraq, Syria, Congo, Guatemala, El Salvador and Afghanistan all now resettling in Los Angeles. Our program is unique, in that it enables our team to work from the safety of their homes. Every Neococo product promotes equity and financial freedom for our incredible employees. By creating employment we want to ensure that women resettling in Los Angeles have what they need to rebuild their lives and regain their identity. Our team continues to work with governments, businesses and local nonprofit organizations to encourage and actively promote women’s safe economic empowerment. Our dream is to be able to create more Neococo community teams across the country, and to one day even be able to offer equitable work and support services to women in refugee camps worldwide.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "With the integration of different cultures comes a culmination of arts, handicrafts, cuisine & experiences.This is exactly what sets Los Angeles apart from other cities. Economists also agree that the effects of immigration on the US economy are broadly positive. Our Neococo platform enables individuals to immediately start working and being self-sufficient which allows them to further their capabilities by investing in education.This also allows for a smooth integration into society instead of being segregated into low income areas. Economic well being enables affordable housing which makes communities safer & healthier. As we grow with greater visibility, it means that our community programs can expand too. This hopefully leads us to our big dream - The Neococo Collective, a storefront where a customer can buy directly from Neococo artisans in their city along with our team participating as sales associates and other staff members managing day to day activities at the store."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "This summer California will begin closing its three youth detention centers and shift the responsibility of juvenile justice onto the state’s 58 counties, ending an 80-year history of detention facilities that have been criticized for violence and racial disparities. The burden of change now comes to LA County. At a cost of around $300,000 per incarcerated youth, the County has spent significant amounts of money over the decades. We want to see this money reinvested in young people healing from trauma caused by a system that has disproportionately violated young people of color. Green Arrow recognizes that the roots of this disproportionate harm comes from socialized behaviors, racial disparities from the justice system, a disparate educational system, and generational poverty and trauma. With a rising increase in mental health issues over the past two years we believe this program is needed now, particularly as the County wrestles with a new approach to working with these youth.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We envision Los Angeles County to be the center of a nationwide movement that provides youth with an opportunity to reclaim themselves and their future following involvement with the justice system through the healing power of nature. We want to see the County move away from a blame based system to one that seeks to repair the individual, the collective and structural norms that led to harm. We envision this leading to a recreation of what the justice system looks like for youth and young adults in our region. Instead of removing and shunning people from the community where they've caused harm we aim to bring them back into connection and belonging to the land and the self. To aid in this, we seek to support young people harmed by systemic injustice, structural racism and a societal disconnection by re-learning the importance of care, compassion, and connecting them to income opportunities for long-term stability.",

Additionally, we interweave discussions about racial theory, decolonization, and indigenizing, which helps young people re-acclimate to their inner selves and their place in the world. We teach trauma healing techniques by engaging with breath, movement, and sound exercises to facilitate self-confidence and emotional balance. The curriculum also integrates life skills, environmental sustainability, culinary skills and recipes. The gardening work is led by participants to promote a sense of ownership. Youth receive a stipend for their time. As part of our commitment in building self-efficacy and sustainable communities, the young people that participate in this program receive a stipend for their continued commitment to the program’s mindfulness work and upkeep of the garden. Proposed sites for the coming year include: 1) Anti-Recidivism Coalition Magnolia Re-entry House (in progress) - a program already underway, teaching 5-10 young men ages 18-26 2) Homeboys - (starting summer 2022) day center program for disconnected youth with an urban garden 3) My Friends Place - (starting summer 2022) working with youth experiencing homelessness",

LA River revitalization efforts and market forces have made the region popular for land acquisition and development, leading to higher property values and rents. Meanwhile, the pandemic and inflation have exacerbated housing insecurity, with growing rental debt and household costs. While there are public programs created to curb these pressures, at its root, the housing system is not designed to support the most vulnerable. Cities like Los Angeles have been planned in ways that disinvest in the working poor and people of color, yet are eager to invest when there are opportunities for profit. As the housing crisis threatens to push entire communities out of their neighborhoods, it’s imperative to reimagine another way – one that honors local knowledge and culture, restores relationships with land, and centers those most vulnerable to displacement.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA Más seeks to demonstrate a model in which community expertise – not funding opportunities, for-profit developers, government agencies or politicians – shapes housing solutions. Through this initiative, working class renters of color are creating neighborhood stability on their own terms through organizing, honoring cultural ways of living, and reconnecting with land and one another. We acknowledge our relationship to land is extractive – characterized by indigenous displacement, private land ownership in opposition of community and connection, and market-rate housing inaccessible to the working class. LA Más sees collective investment as a powerful alternative that reimagines a relationship to land that is not based on individual ownership but prioritizes the collective. With so many other communities in LA County, especially other historic neighborhoods of color, also experiencing rapid displacement, this program is part of a growing movement to reclaim the places we call home.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "LA Más is piloting an alternative to traditional forms of affordable housing: a community-powered housing solution that centers working class renters of color in Northeast LA. For the past year, LA Más has created a housing advocacy space, where community members discuss housing priorities, values and solutions they want to see. LA Más shares resources on topics such as tenant rights, cooperative living models, and policies. This has built a foundation for residents to shape and lead a neighborhood initiative that offers options for housing stability, affordability and the right to permanence. To actualize this vision, LA Más will carry out the following activities: • Leadership Development | From its housing advocacy space, LA Más will identify resident leaders interested in shaping the new initiative. LA Más will host trainings to share examples of communal housing solutions and facilitate collective decision-making. • Program Creation | The program will be refined during the grant period, but could involve community members buying a property together. LA Más will refine program details with resident leaders and identify partnerships (which could include property owners willing to sell for a community purpose or tenants interested in buying their building). • Community Stewardship | The goal of the program will be for community members themselves to steward land and housing. LA Más will support the pilot’s sustainability by seeking funding and establishing infrastructure.",

This will alleviate the stress on programs and services outside of Santa Clarita. Additionally, the programs and services we provide are geared to retain a high rate of clients remaining housed versus returning to the streets. Because we incorporate education, employment, and empowerment in every aspect of service delivery, our clients express motivation to stay housed and stay employed. This affords a meaningful long-term cost savings on the County’s social service systems. As we continue to implement housing services at the new facility, we anticipate future collaborations with programs and services across Los Angeles that impact both our immediate community and the greater LA region.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Bridge to Home measures outcomes by tracking: number of clients who present for services; number of shelter beds filled; meals served; number of clients working with case managers and housing navigators; number of clients who secure employment; number of clients enrolled in education; number placed in permanent supportive housing. Data is entered in LAHSA's Clarity system, DHS's CHAMPs system, and on-site client files. We use the evidence-based Housing First model for finding housing as quickly as possible. According to the National Alliance of Ending Homelessness, this model is proven to reduce a return to homelessness. Our outcomes for permanently housing clients demonstrate the effectiveness of providing homeless services in one accessible space where we become an empowering support system for our clients. In fiscal year 20/21, we served 1,000 individuals and housed 82 individuals and 42 families. As we continue to expand services, the trajectory of client success improves.",

In Santa Clarita, our most vulnerable neighbors face staggering factors that, without support services, increase the likelihood of more people experiencing homelessness. Some of the factors that increase risk for people who are unhoused or vulnerable to losing their home include the effects of the COVID19 pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, the removal of eviction protections, increased cost of living disproportionate to income, cost and access to healthcare, and the overwhelming need for support for our most vulnerable neighbors. Bridge to Home is the only year-round shelter facility in the area.

The site will include a kitchen and dining room, classrooms, a technology center, training rooms, medical offices, outdoor meeting spaces - all designed to help clients with their employment, education, and housing goals. Clients will be empowered to address their specific barriers to housing such as under-employment, lack of education, trauma, abuse and domestic violence, addiction, legal issues. Programs include compassionate care that will build confidence during their journey towards housing. Bridge to Home serves as a nexus for the community’s collective efforts to help its neighbors in need. We are the community’s Coordinated Entry System (CES) satellite office and the primary Family Solutions Services provider for the area. We interface with virtually every system and agency that encounters people experiencing homelessness, including the hospital, school districts, libraries, county Departments of Health Services and Mental Health, and a broad spectrum of service agencies, including the Child and Family Center, Family Promise, Single Mother’s Outreach and Santa Clarita’s dozens of generous and active faith communities and civic groups."

SFLS Is a six module life and soft-skills program designed to help individuals succeed personally and professionally. SFLS helps participants focus on understanding their behaviors, attitudes and relationships with others to improve their work and personal lives. Curriculums centered on Life Skills will be offered to students from age 5-18. A special emphasis will be placed on students age 15-18, in order to assist them during a critical age where they are seeking jobs and higher education. Each community we have worked with, rich or poor, has benefited from our Life Skill curriculum, yet, we have found that the most effective programs have stemmed from an understanding of the immediate and long term needs of each unique community. Our dashboard of services ranges from peer mediation to successful job seeker habits. Often times though, communities face crisis’s that can be detrimental, such as school violence or racial conflict. CRC can immediately work with schools and communities to address these issues in a timely manner. CRC will provide comprehensive services that go beyond the scope of a traditional student peer mediation program, where youth and adults will be partners in issues such as violence prevention.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The documented impact of this program is measured in an entire school population and also its surrounding community. All youth within a school will be affected. Our program will work with 2 high schools 2 middle School and 2 elementary Schools. Furthermore the skill sets that youth will learn will have an impact on each of their families. If each school has an average enrollment of 300 students than we will be affecting 1800 students and more specifically some of those students will earn certificates in matters such as Conflict Resolution and Peer Mediation, that will benefit their school. Also, teachers at each school will be trained in programs such as Anti-bullying, Peer Mediation and Empathy. An example of a specific impact will stem from our programs that will target cases involving suspensions, poor attendance, disrespectful student behavior towards school officials, parent complaints, teacher-administration disputes, and community complaints against school sites.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We are looking at youth living in communities that within the next ten years will not be able to afford to live in their own neighborhoods. Due to gentrification and rent increases our program participants will have to move out of their own neighborhoods to make way for individuals with higher wage earnings. Our programs will provide pathways to obtaining higher paying jobs and higher education that will give them a fighting chance of living and purchasing real estate In the communities that they grew up in and have roots. We will demonstrate that through our Life Skill and self-advocacy programs coupled with collaborators that specialize in assisting marginalized communities we can affect the lives of our targeted youth. Our success will be measured by the ability of our programs to provide life skills in a short time period to address student success and to provide skill sets that will impact the lives of individuals and communities on an ongoing basis."

Informational interviews are a great way to start building a network of people in jobs and industries they are considering. Step 3: Reality Testing (11th) -provides an opportunity for students to job shadow, find an internship, or volunteer to “test the waters.” It is also an opportunity to conduct more informational interviews with professionals at work. During this very important stage, students start understanding how their preferences and skills relate to certain career paths, work environments, etc, and begin making realistic decisions on next potential steps in their career journeys. Step 4: Implementation (12 & Alumni)-This can include preparation for a job interview or completing applications to graduate school.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "California is projected to fall 1.1 million bachelor’s degrees short of economic demand by 2030. C5LA’s programs guide low-income students through high school and ensure they stay on track to graduate college and get into the careers of their choice. This is especially important to us because according to a report from the Los Angeles Scholars Invest Fund, 50% of Los Angeles County 9th graders don’t graduate high school. This number is frightening when one takes into consider that students from wealthier families have higher completion rates compared to students from low-income families. Economic barriers, lack of academic and emotional support and challenges with fitting in make it difficult for low-income, first-generation students to graduate high school, get into college, graduate, and get into their careers.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "As an organization, we provide equity beyond checking GPAs. Our cohort-based model builds long-term, supportive relationships throughout high school and college and we deliver five unique summer adventures that provide students an opportunity to flex and build the self-confidence skills they will need to succeed in school, college, career and life. Our programs were designed as a multi-program and multi-year approach to ensure that every C5 student had the necessary skills and resources needed to break down systemic barriers as they pursue their college dream and ultimatly, get into their careers. These programs serve 500 future Leaders of Los Angeles, ages 13-24 who live in households with an income at or below the poverty level, attend Title 1 schools and are the first in their family to attend college."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Children experiencing homelessness are among the most invisible and neglected individuals in our nation; they are the least likely to benefit from quality learning experiences – they are the least likely to benefit from ANY learning experiences. Studies show that students who have ever been homeless or highly mobile have significantly lower academic achievement in reading and math throughout elementary and middle school—and lower rates of academic growth—than students in stable homes (even those in families with very low income, special education students, and English-language learners). The loss of a home and the consequential mobility can be traumatic, leaving children with tumultuous feelings that can impact their social and intellectual wellbeing, making it difficult to engage and resulting in behavioral problems that interfere with learning at almost three times the rate of other children.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "With one-on-one support proven most effective at improving academic and personal trajectories, our work is centered around our Tutoring Program, which mobilizes volunteers to provide weekly focused educational support, along with reinforcement, positive modeling, and constructive feedback. When the pandemic struck, our years-long focus on Digital Learning allowed us to quickly adapt all our programs to an online format. We worked with school districts, shelters, and foster families to ensure their students could engage in learning and meet with their tutors online, distributing over 600 Chromebooks/devices and 413 hotspots. We solidified STEAM elements into our lesson plans to help students succeed in digital spaces (Level Up Digital Learning Program), and focused our annual Digital Learning Days around digital skills with creativity (including a virtual Scratch/animation art competition). We also partnered with organizations that helped us provide 2,500 STEM kits (California Science Center), 1,000 creative kits (Cayton Children's Museum and PBS SoCal), and coding programs and education (Beats Unlocked; Hip Hop for Change). Too, we have incorporated parental engagement into our work (in the past, our live tutoring format allowed us to focus all of our efforts on the students – but we can no longer afford this luxury), since caregivers must able to support their children’s education (something lower income families are less equipped to do).",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Over the grant period, we will help 2,000 students get back on the educational track – to help them escape generational poverty over the long term. This work is critical: last year’s testing results showed that more than 200,000 students in LA were not meeting grade-level goals in math and reading – and that the gap in grades that existed before the pandemic between Black and Latinx students and their white and Asian counterparts widened to as much as 21 percentage points. This year’s testing results are likely to be even lower since nearly half of LAUSD students have been chronically absent this school year, and since many of those who did attend were not able to get the full benefit because of computer issues. (Almost 25% of LAUSD students have connectivity speeds that are below standard – and 5% have connectivity speeds that are far below standard. Not surprisingly, students identified as homeless and foster youth are overrepresented in these numbers.)"

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Many youth in foster care experience the trauma of repeated attachment and detachment throughout their lives. Frequently, they develop maladaptive behaviors in order to cope. These behaviors do not disappear once a young person turns 18 and begins looking for work. Seen&Heard exists to provide social emotional education to build professional character for system impacted youth. What has been observed in this population is the repetition of childhood patterns of attachment and detachment at work. If youth in foster care do not possess the social emotional tools to tolerate stress, communicate clearly, set boundaries or advocate for themselves, this may lead to repeated job loss and the inability to reach sustainable and secure employment. This seems to be a blind-spot in DCFS requirements for TAY, where focus lies mainly on \"technical\" life-skills like budgeting and safety, while overlooking the importance of learning how to handle your emotions at work or communicate with colleagues.",

In December 2020, the LA Times reported that year saw 157 bad air days–the most since the mid 1990s. According to a 2016 LA Dept of City Planning report, transportation, including personal vehicles, accounts for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in LA and is a top contributor to air pollution. Not all are affected equally. According to a 2019 report from the Union of Concerned Scientists, communities of color in CA are exposed to key air pollutants from vehicles at disproportionately higher rates: Black residents have a 43% higher exposure rate than white, Latinx 39% more, and Asian 21% more.",

Women represent only 28% of overall employed scientists and engineers in the U.S., and just 2% are Latinas. There is an immediate opportunity to address this imbalance with the U.S. expecting to have 3.5 million STEM job vacancies by 2025. Acting now, we can ensure we fill these openings with workers who reflect our country’s demographics.

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Access to Creative Industry Employment (sponsored by Snap Foundation)",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The issue stems from 2012 when the national CTCNet was disbanded after the last overall and first-time-ever annual conference held in LA. The conference was dominated by proprietary software company supporters and was blatantly highjacked. A collaborative digital divide network has not existed in support of shared resources, minimum program duplication, and community system best practices for the many agencies working to tackle the ever-growing and changing digital divide. In the ICT realm, we have paid for and used ESRI GIS proprietary software for the last few years. A government GIS Mapping expert volunteered with us and he convinced us that it was the best way to go. For 2 years now, we paid for account access and credits up front that expired before we used them. Our account is limited to basic applications that would require additional license fees to perform more than the basic analysis of data. We have lost maps from the previous year's work as they were on the ESRI portal.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Lack of digital divide agencies' knowledge of, interest in, and ultimate evolution to incorporate more modern ICT systems. 2020 census data and ongoing releases of big data are not being leveraged by digital divide agencies in LA County. In most cases, proprietary software is the overwhelming choice of non-profits. There are no trends, that we know of, towards open-source adoption in digital divide agencies. Therefore, this project can produce a new trend. The Geo for All Initiative integrates many of the project's proposed components into a unified suite of open-source software applications. Furthermore, OSGeo's annual software distribution includes workshop data that are selected through a competitive submission process. The culmination and time of this project will include producing datasets that have the potential for being included in the 2023 workshop data distribution.

Through its trauma-informed model of care, NHF and its partners will provide medical support and social services for its guests that are built on a foundation of trust and care, with the goal of transitioning our neighbors into permanent housing.

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "San Fernando Valley",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "At its recuperative care/medical respite program in Arleta, NHF will be adapting its trauma-informed model of care to the specialized needs of older adults experiencing homelessness, who have complex health conditions, and age 20 years more rapidly than their sheltered peers. No other recuperative care facility in Los Angeles County is serving this population of older adults in the tailored way needed, and this has led to an increased likelihood of re-hospitalization, recidivism, incarceration, or returning to the streets. NHF’s 48,000 square foot, 72 room facility will provide interim housing and recuperative care to 148 older adults who have experienced homelessness, until they transition into permanent housing. Services will include medical oversight, medication management, health education, nutritional programs, and counseling. Through NHF’s partnerships with hospitals and clinics, the facility will also provide on-site medical care, including daily vitals and temperature checks, vision and dental clinics, and other medical-model components that will be specifically designed for the needs of an estimated total of 300 older adults per year who will be staying at the facility, and low-income older adults in the area who also need access to medical care and social services. This facility will also serve as a community hub to encourage interaction between the neighborhood and guests staying at the facility through community events, walking paths, and a community garden.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "There are currently no recuperative care facilities in Los Angeles County that are designed specifically for the specialized needs of older adults who have experienced homelessness. The current one-size-fits-all model has led to older adults returning to the streets or the hospital because they are not receiving the medical oversight they need in a trauma-informed model that is tailored to the unique and complex experiences of older adults. NHF's interim housing and recuperative care facility in Arleta will provide a space where these older adults can get the specialized support and care they need. Based on the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority's Homeless Count in 2020, the facility will effectively end homelessness for older adults in Council District 6 within the first 18 months of operation. Last but not least, this facility has the potential of serving as a model of care for unsheltered older adults that can be replicated in other parts of Los Angeles County.",

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The older adult population is the fastest growing segment of the homeless population in Los Angeles County. According to the LA Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), there are 15,000 unsheltered older adults on the streets of Los Angeles, a number that is expected to triple by 2030. Black and Latinx older adults are disproportionately represented among those aging on the streets. Older adults face complex health challenges and have medical ages that exceed their biological ages by 20 years. They often face accessibility challenges and have difficulty performing activities of daily living, making it difficult to to manage on the street or in traditional shelters. The existing \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to shelter and interim housing will only exacerbate this problem, as more older adults end up on the street. Also, few, if any interim housing facilities have dedicated programs that provide preventative social and medical services to low-income, under-resourced neighbors in the area.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Funding for the renovation of the interim housing facility has been approved by the City of Los Angeles and it is expected to launch in January 2023. NHF will define success as it does in its other recuperative care facilities: the provision of trauma-informed care that increases the well-being of guests within the facility and their ability to transition to permanent housing. We will measure this success with qualitative and quantitative indicators such as but not limited to: - Stabilization in the number of unhoused seniors in Council District 6 through official statistics such as the LAHSA Homeless Count. - Percentage of guests moving to permanent housing, measured through discharge records. - Improved health and well-being, measured through tracking of health data, such as daily vitals. - Number of community residents coming to facility for social services and medical care. - Guest feedback through anonymous survey kiosks placed throughout the facility."

Muralism emphasizes inclusion while creating art for the community. Paid Artists with special needs beautify Los Angeles walls. We partner with other nonprofits to create murals illustrating the diversity of our community. “Paint by number” murals are prepared by neurodiverse artists. The public then joins the artists to color in the mural and experiences the strengths they bring to the Los Angeles community. Our team then details the art. Everyone returns for a ribbon cutting celebration with media and public officials. Muralism’s goal is to paint 100 murals in Los Angeles County by the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics. Neurodiverse artists create beautiful representations of LA’s rich history. We teach, support, train, and employ young adults with special needs to paint murals for schools, shelters, police stations, public spaces, and even our councilman’s office. Artists come from the Latino, African American, Caucasian, Asian, Indigenous, Homeless, and LGBTQ communities. We have developed a tailored and innovative system to educate and train employees. Vocational, on-the-job, and art classes prepare individuals to work and not just for Muralism. Two artists have already left us for full-time positions. Three are in training for teaching positions.

Disabilities, including Autism, affect all ethnic and socioeconomic groups. What they need is to become an integral part of society. The best way for inclusion to become a reality is for special needs individuals to work side by side with everybody else. How better than by painting a community mural with the community?

Today cities like Philadelphia and Miami rival that claim. Every mural inspires 10 more artists to create their own murals. Let’s make the City of Angels beautiful, together! A study at one of our murals, The Campbell Center, estimated that 31K people drive by that mural every day. That is only one of the 30 murals we have already produced. We intend to create at least 70 more murals in Los Angeles before the 2028 Summer Olympics. Special needs artists will earn 21,000 more paid hours. Another 5000 volunteers will experience Muralism before we have reached our goal. We have several public walls identified and cleared with property owners and the city, but lack the funds to make them happen. Many more nonprofits reach out to us every day looking to match funds for Paint Day Events.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Noveil is a video first dating app that eliminates the possibility of fake profiles, puts personality first, and gives women the opportunity to use their intuition when determining if this is a good match. Here's how it works. Users sign up, they are asked a few questions about preferences, and then they are presented with one option, start dating. From here, our back end algorithm uses machine learning to find them a match. Once that match is found, the two are immediately placed in a 3 min video call and provided two icebreakers to stimulate the conversation. After the time is up they are asked if they like each other. If so, it's a match and they can message each other and meet in person. Our main goal is to bring angelenos together in a fun and safe way. We have validated this concept with real users and they enjoy the experience. In our initial test run alone, there were 7 successful in person dates, and this was a test run of only 20 people. By paving the way, we will be able to then reach back and help others from our area succeed in entrepreneurship.",

We tested this concept using zoom to simulate the process with over 200 LA college students and got a 94% satisfaction rate. We also recently won the New Venture Competition placing #1 out of 200 teams. Our go to market strategy is mainly social media and our engagement is growing at a rate of 400% each month! So what does this mean, that we have validated our solution to this problem, people love our product, and they are already familiar with our brand. There are 700+ people on the waitlist for our final product. Joining the ranks of LA2050 is imperative to our growth. To succeed we require resources and a solid network in LA, beyond our current situation. Our goal by the end of the grant period is to average 20,000 matches a day and reach over 1 million users.

This is the case despite all of the online dating apps/ friend app on the market, so we know the current dating options are not working for Generation Z. The dating industry is currently plagued with the following issues. Fake profiles ( catfishing ), superficial dating practices, and a lack of focus on women's safety. Only 17% of daters have ended up in an actual relationship after matching online, which is why Gen Z is still the loneliest generation of all time. In addition to that, the large tech boom that's taking over California doesn't seem to include African Americans. Only 5% of all tech employees are black, in contrast over 30% of all LA County Jail inmates are black. We are determined to change this statistic and give black youth another option, similar to Vector90.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Imagine an LA where inner city youth are more interested in computers than guns. While I was growing up in LA ,this was not the case. In 2017, at the start of my college education, I was arrested for a crime I did not commit. I spent 1 year in LA county jail before being exonerated, all due to the perception society has of me. However now, when they see me, with my Computer Science degree and my laptop, things are very different. More people need to see stories like this, because only then will they believe it's possible to achieve that same accomplishment As a product, Noveil will change lives. We estimate our solution will cure depression for many and lower reported mental health issues by at least 50%. In the short term, we want to help generation Z LA youth easily find a relationship, but in the long term we are looking to change dating culture as a whole within our community. Each successful match on Noveil will get people off their devices and connecting in person."

And while Sidewalk Vending is legal in Los Angeles, most vendors risk selling food on the street without a permit because they cannot afford one. This is due to state public health laws that require expensive cart setups, equipment, and commissary costs from vendors who make less than $20,000 a year. And as California aims to pass Senate Bill 972 to make it easier for food vendors to navigate the health permit process, Sidewalk Vendors are in desperate need to legally operate their businesses now, and secure a source of income. 70.6% of the residents in are people of color, including non-lawful permanent residents who only possess Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers and are not legally eligible for employment. Sidewalk Vending has become the only way for families to put food on the table, and break the cycle of poverty.",

It will also establish Sidewalk Vending as a profitable industry that anyone can launch with proper guidance. The microloans will allow vendors establish a positive business credit payment history and help them become eligible for traditional financing. Having access to capital can make it easier to launch, or stabilize a business. Becoming bankable is the first step for Sidewalk Vendors to increase their household income.",

AWOKE’s approach to youth development is based on a cradle-to-career framework that prioritizes wellbeing throughout the arc of human development. Activities are designed to develop youth resilience, social cohesion, and community wellbeing to ensure youth can healthily navigate their community and the growing demands of adulthood. Recognizing that youth may not have a safe or productive living environment, the UNITE Cultural Center serves as a drop-in center to a significant number of first- and second-generation students and newcomers to the community.

Further, these communities are also disproportionally impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has worsened existing social inequities and led to a drastic increase in disconnected youth regionally. The Advancement Project reported that in LA County 1 in 5 Latinx youth and 1 in 4 Black youth between 16-24 dropped out of school and did not have a job.",

Activities are facilitated by seasoned staff and guest practitioners with several years of experience in their craft. Staff utilize empowerment-based approaches to mobilize the arts and athletics to curate transformative spaces that foster identity work and address trauma. Staff also serve as mentors to participants in the internship program, which is focused on developing the next generation creative workforce. Based on their interests and experience, interns are placed in the Media & Marketing or Events & Sponsorships tracks. Interns work with staff to help support daily functions from content creation and social media management to event planning and program coordination. Furthermore, through these mentorships, youth are exposed to unique vantage points through which they are empowered to develop their creative identity and embrace a lifelong pursuit of knowledge. As youth grapple with communities re-open, engagement in creative and cultural exchanges reduces the feelings of apathy and discontent that are heightened due to the prolonged conditions of social isolation throughout the pandemic."

In a matter of six months, Journey House members secured a major victory to expand the age limit from 21 to 26, including an ongoing $4,000,000 investment to support the expansion.

The problem in implementing the TAY framework is that it is in direct conflict with what the data, science, and direct practice is telling us about the needs of foster youth in their transition into adulthood, in particular when helping people heal from trauma. Before anyone can develop the skills to succeed in adult life, the psychological and emotional work must take place first. However, very few young people have the maturity and capacity to begin the healing process at 18, 21, or even 24 years of age, and that is where the deficit in the TAY framework resides. Age limits of the TAY model create unintended expectations that former foster youth must become fully self-sufficient by the age of 24, which in today's economy, is an unrealistic expectation, even for individuals with resourceful families.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Beyond Foster Care (BFC) campaign launched at Journey House in 2015 as a storytelling effort to raise awareness on the impacts of age out policies that affect programs and services for former foster youth. Over 50 Journey House foster youth members co-designed the initiative, creating Journey House’s first official advocacy program in its 35 year history. To reach Beyond Foster Care’s goals, we seek to educate the public on the realities of life in and out of the foster care system. We advocate for state-wide policies to create resources that support older former foster youth, and we empower youth to take a proactive stance on the issues that impact their lives. To date, Beyond Foster Care’s has directly created over $45,000,000 in statewide funding to directly support former foster youth. Our Speaker's Panel has been the key to the success of our advocacy efforts, BFC achieving major systems change initiatives that have resulted in structural changes across the State of California for supporting older foster youth. The panel serves as our core youth leadership development component where we train foster youth on public speaking, individual narratives, message delivery, and also to craft and develop their own best practice and policy recommendations for child welfare leaders. develop former foster youth into professional level advocates to shift the narratives of trauma and victimization to one of empowerment.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Success for this initiative means that future child welfare leaders will challenge the status quo of the TAY model by adopting our recommendations of providing needs based services, not aged based services. Additionally, a new wave of former foster youth will have engaged in a significant professional development curriculum (Foster Power) that will have given them a new set of tools as professional advocates, but will also position them as strong candidates for careers in macro level social work. It is when our young people succeed that we feel most confident in achieving our north star goal of challenging the TAY framework to support individual needs. When we succeed, the TAY field will have taken action to reflect the understanding of our messages that trauma and the healing process is not linear, and therefore resources should be available when people are ready to heal."

K-5 students in the BSHP receive lessons on birds and conservation concepts which are in alignment with the Next Generation Sciences Standards. The program unfolds in 4 phases. 1/ Teachers receive lesson plans, program videos and activities and deliver them at their own pace before our visit. 2/ BSHP docents and interns visit the classroom to reinforce the lesson theme with additional activities and materials, such as nests and taxidermy, and to answer questions. 3/ Students visit a local park for a half day in nature, where they can see birds in their natural habitat. Each child uses birding binoculars to view birds with a guide, interacts with educational owls at close range and has time to enjoy the natural surroundings. Every component of this field trip is designed to build knowledge of birds, the ecosystem and conservation and to develop a sense of wonder and belonging in the natural world. 4/ The native habitat garden offers ongoing opportunities for children to explore nature throughout the year at their school.

For them to talk about protecting the birds by not leaving trash and especially food trash around was a big deal in my class. -\tStudents were able to make a connection as they got to learn of common birds within our area. Mourning doves and crows became popular as they were easily identified for their unmistakable features and vocalization patterns throughout the school.

The pandemic, with its virtual classrooms and constant screentime, has exacerbated this problem. Many schools offer asphalt covered playgrounds instead of gardens. Yet time spent in nature has proven benefits for human health and well-being. People living in neighborhoods with more birds, shrubs and trees are less likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, according to research at the Univ. of Exeter. At the same time, our planet and humanity are now facing two looming crises of our own making, climate change and biodiversity loss. Scientists increasingly understand that the two are linked. Audubon’s 2019 transverse study called Survival by Degrees, shows that two thirds of N. American bird species risk extinction from global temperature rise. If we lose the birds, we lose the ecosystem upon which we depend. We are all interdependent. We need a new generation of committed environmentalists to tackle these enormous problems.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "PAS has been offering educational programming for many years. We have a track record of success which we measure by the number of young people coming out of our programs who choose to pursue higher education and careers in areas relating to the environment. This year Ashwin S. heads to Harvard to study Ecology and Biology. Dessi S. is doing the same at Stanford. Both have published research papers and are poised to make meaningful contributions to science which have the potential to impact conservation efforts in LA County and beyond. With the BSHP, we want to provide to a wider audience the same resources with which we have supported prior generations of young birders. We do not expect every child to become a birder or a scientist, but it is our hope that they all come to value nature, its creatures and understand how important it is to protect them. We are cultivating deeply committed future environmental advocates and this is key to addressing the issues described above."

In 2009, the Bridge to Success (B2S) program was created to address the staggering dropout crisis of underserved youth in Long Beach and bring over 400 students the opportunity to rebuild their education, finish high school, and open their world to new college and career opportunities. Both programs emphasize the importance of having a “Growth Mindset,” the underlying belief that abilities can be developed through effort and practice. By teaching youth to embrace the challenge, we seek to alter long-term academic and personal outcomes for these students. We believe that a growth mindset is a key to life-long success. Despite steady increases in graduation rates within the state of California, some schools within Long Beach have rates as low as 55%. Working directly with these schools in the Long Beach Unified School District, B2S gives high school students who have not been successful in a traditional classroom setting, are credit deficient, and are at-risk for dropping out of school, the opportunity to receive high school credit, graduate with a high school diploma, and gain real-life career-based and personal self-help skills.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Long Beach BLAST creates direct collaborations between educational, nonprofit, and corporate organizations in the local Long Beach community. There are many mentoring organizations in Long Beach, but none are implemented like the Academic Mentoring Program. Volunteers are purposefully pulled from local colleges and placed directly into schools where there is a need and where students need additional academic help, have a low attendance rate, low self-esteem issues, etc. These experiences encourage future educators and social servants to take a personal interest in the youth of Long Beach. Mentoring is becoming a fully integrated in-school support within the Long Beach Unified School District in grades K-12.

In Long Beach alone, nearly 8,000 children are living in poverty, and close to 1,600 are living in deep poverty. Poorer children and teens are at a greater risk for negative outcomes such as poor academic achievement, abuse and neglect, behavioral and socioemotional problems, physical health problems, and developmental delays. Students from low-income families are more than twice as likely to drop out of school as middle-income kids, and over ten times more likely than their high-income peers to drop out. Dropping out of school is detrimental to students’ futures – it increases the likelihood of committing a crime and imprisonment, being unemployed, and living below the poverty line.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "All BLAST programs utilize a multi-faceted evaluation, which includes both qualitative and quantitative methods. This assessment tool was redeveloped in 2015 in consultation with Dr. Beth Manke of California State University Long Beach and recently in 2020 with Dr. Kristin Powers of California State University Long Beach and data consultant, Eric Wat with Destiny Consulting Services. The evaluation categories include academics, behavior, attitude, self-esteem, attendance, and motivation. Bridge to Success goes beyond this evaluation system. BLAST consults with the Long Beach Unified School District to gather data (grades, attendance, citizenship, demographic, social-emotional learning survey results, etc.) on participating students. Our partner schools and LBUSD provide us with pre and post data for Bridge to Success students to help us better evaluate the efficiency of the program and allow us to make enhancements. LBUSD also provides data on where each B2S student attends college."

Our thoughts about this involve the introduction of Johnny to what we like to call MAKOTO PRE-SCHOOL CURRICULUM, which is the gentle incorporation of important core values into Johnny’s conscious and subconscious mind between 0-7 years old, when the maximum learning and life-programming occurs.. MAKOTO is a Japanese word that stands for Sincerity and Truth, two fundamental character traits that are supported by such desirable qualities as, awareness, honesty, responsible, sincerity, generosity, gratitude, respect, patience, reliability, love, care, kindness, creativity, cooperation, consideration, forgiveness, fairness, inclusion, peace, and integrity. This list will evolve as Youth Publications, Inc.(YPI) brings together the minds of Childcare Providers, Pre-School Directors and Principals into a very special Founders Group, who have already identified and experienced the need for the development of such an important project, either in their classroom, or in their school. We believe that a DAILY reminder of these preferred character qualities, in a fun, thoughtful, and challenging way, will gently remind our children what type of positive behavior is expected and accepted, within their family, school and community. That is why we created the MAKOTO Memory Card Game, which was designed to be played DAILY at school and home.",

By 2050 the Preschoolers of today will be young positive adults. Young boys will no longer feel the necessity of belonging to gangs, because PARENTS will learn the benefits of MAKOTO with their children, as they also play the MAKOTO Memory Card Game. Both women and men will appreciate and enjoy loving relationships WITHOUT the need of OWNERSHIP and CONTROL, because with the DAILY practice of MAKOTO, they will be personally fulfilled and happy with their own lives, with or without another's company.

Project is in it's early state, even though it was initially conceived in 2014 with the MAKOTO Memory Card Game. With the added creation of the MAKOTO DAILY ACTION CHART, we can monitor how engaged each child is becoming every month. As a child's familiarity grows with the 20 MAKOTO behaviors and meanings, they will be able to match their behaviors with the MAKOTO words more easily, and identify them faster and more often. As each month progresses, the children's identification frequency will increase, and this will also be reflected in their notebooks where they write or draw their use of the MAKOTO words EACH DAY. With the passing of every two months, the Teachers will reward the students with prizes for engaging the most times with any one of the 20 MAKOTO words.

In lieu of the multiple suicides and school shootings over the past decade by CHILDREN, it’s time to take a serious look at how we are raising our children! We have become so focused on the factual and academic development of Johnny’s “mind” that we have forgotten about the development of Johnny’s inner character and his spirit!

Nowhere is that more true that the San Gabriel Valley, home to 1.8 million people. The suburban myth obscures not only the tremendous racial, ethnic, and class diversity, but also erases the rapidly worsening housing situation. The cost burden of housing is accelerating, especially for tenants, and housing insecurity and homelessness are growing rapidly. More people are living in overcrowded apartments even as building quality declines. School district data shows declining enrollment as families are displaced and increasing homelessness among students. The region’s 31 cities grant few legal protections to tenants. There aren’t significant resources or vehicles for solidarity available to renters facing housing insecurity. Renters aren’t well organized and they lack civic influence and a say in decision-making compared to homeowners even in tenant-majority cities.",

Building the power of tenants, within and across SGV cities, is crucial to shifting the systems and policies that favor the interests of the propertied to the detriment of those who rent their housing. This project is unique as regionwide and region-specific effort based on scaling up the existing collaborations among LA Forward, the People’s Resource Center, and SGV Tenants Alliance. The main part of our program seeks to educate tenants on their rights and on housing policy, help them grow their organizing and civic engagement skills through training workshop, and build community within and across the region’s cities. To accomplish this, we’ll host series of educational teach-ins and skill-building workshops for a cohort of SGV renters. We’ll also: Host two SGV-wide gatherings at a public park allowing people to meet in-person, develop relationships across cities, and participate in fun and artistic expressively activities like interactive City Visioning. Scale up our work to seed housing justice groups in different cities and support existing groups with research and technical support, as well as access to regional networks.

We look forward to investing in higher quality tools and instruments and procuring higher grade ingredients. Our tools and instruments will allow us to increase our batch size while maintaining our quality. Currently, all products are hand made in small batches to control the quality. We will continue to make products in small batches, but looking forward to upgraded tools. Our tools will additionally contribute to a sustainable workflow while reducing food waste. Many of our locally produced products allows us to sustainably produce and transport products with lower costs and delays. We look forward to integrating local organic ingredients to curate sustainable and healthy treat options. According to a UCLA geography professor, meating-eating by dog and cats creates about 64 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, which is about 13.6 million cars a year.

With inspiration from my own experience with an ailing pet, I investigated the need for higher quality pet products. All of our treats do not contain soy, corn, fillers, or chemicals. These added products are common in pet food and treats to increase profit margins and stabilize products. We take care to not over treat our products with heat in order to preserve their integrity. At high temperatures, the components are reduced to carbohydrate fillers. Our core mission to maintain high quality standards ensure maximum nutrient profiles. Our dogs and cats are not pets but also family. Dog and cat treats should be quality centered and not cost and convenience centered.

In fact, July 2018 analysis by the Pew Research Center found that income inequality for these young women has not changed much since the 1970’s—and newer data suggests that this pervasive challenge is worse after two years in the pandemic. A commonly cited barrier to income equality is access to higher paying jobs, many of which require a college education. Starting in middle school—a critical stage—MOSTe helps girls envision themselves as future college graduates and career professionals. Through mentorship, real life exposure to higher paying careers, information about college and financial aid, and access to networks, students learn to capitalize on their strengths and chart their path to a financially secure future. They graduate college with well-developed “soft skills” and little to no debt, prepared for leadership positions and economic mobility.",

Despite many challenges posed by the pandemic, 100% of our 2020, 2021and 2022 high school graduates are enrolled in college with substantial financial aid. We measure our impact through college graduation rates and frequent evaluation surveys. We also collect data on program participation rates and academic outcomes.

Our model is designed to empower students in our programs through hands-on learning, exposure to diverse career and college options, focused mentorship from women in the community, soft skills development, as well as college application and financing support. We aim to give our students the tools, connections, and exposure needed to succeed and to see themselves as changemakers in their own communities. We address not only the financial and academic barriers that can prevent our students from succeeding in higher education, but also less-visible barriers to higher paying careers. In addition to programming that helps students succeed academically, access new career opportunities, and sustainably finance their educations, we also employ a supportive approach that helps students develop perseverance and grit, confidence, leadership, articulated personal values, and a network of caring mentors.",

A grant will make it possible to deliver our life-changing program to 30 more girls next year. In the long run, these programs result in greater college and career access and limitless possibility for young women in our programs. In addition, the kind of economic parity that we seek to achieve can create ripple effects throughout families and neighborhoods. The young women in our programs are largely first-generation women of color, poised to be the next generation of leaders in LA communities. We envision a future where those who have historically been left out of decision-making can usher in a new era of an inclusive LA that serves us all. Students in MOSTe graduate from elite schools with scholarships, earn advanced degrees, and go on to mentor and lead as professional women in the community."

The scope and scale of the problem is such that 80% of Black and Brown businesses create no legacy or transfer of wealth once the founder dies. Our program takes businesses of 10 years or more in Los Angeles County and helps them build a legacy business above $1MM in sales and sustainable into the 2nd or 3rd generation thus closing the wealth gap. Stanford University did a 2018 study of Hispanic businesses and found that 97% of them never reached $1MM in sales. Without specific data on Black businesses, one can conservatively assume this Stanford statistic would hold true. This has gone on too long in the BIPOC community where businesses disappear once the founder dies. We will provide succession planning and other tools to build a sustainable business.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Los Angeles Mission's Dignity by Design Renovation Project is transforming the experience of the homeless and providing quality housing for men and women in recovery. This project removes the stigma of traditional shelter and focuses on stabilizing men and women by meeting their basic needs for food, housing, and stabilization. Next, we assist through quality case management, therapy, and education. Clients then matriculate into interim housing and finally settle into permanent supportive housing supported by career services and opportunities all while staying at Los Angeles Mission. We firmly believe that by taking a comprehensive approach that encompasses stabilization and housing, we can provide clients with a stable environment to recover, pursue life goals, and improve their overall health and well-being. As such, our proposed Dignity by Design is on the Frontlines of Los Angeles County program intended to be a robust continuum that is dignified by design and contributes to a systemic transformation of poverty alleviation in LA County. By providing clients with necessities—such as food, water, clothes, and a roof over their heads—while inviting their participation in a holistic treatment and rehabilitation process for the mind, body, and soul, we can facilitate sustainable, person-centered outcomes. We are prepared to focus our efforts on combating the effects of COVID-19 and lifting clients permanently out of chronic homelessness.",

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, People Experiencing Homelessness (PEH) have faced a myriad of debilitating physical and psychological conditions, in addition to constant outbreaks such as typhus, hepatitis, HIV, syphilis, and tuberculosis. Combined with a lack of basic necessities and insufficient public resources, the vast majority of PEH cannot reclaim their lives without external intervention. Concerningly, many PEH on Skid Row also experience co-occurring SUDs, SMIs, medical issues, frequent arrests, and repeat incarcerations. Due to their ongoing trauma, behavioral health conditions, and criminal records, PEH have extreme difficulty in obtaining permanent housing, employment, and upward mobility. The situation is such that for every 207 individuals who escape homelessness per day, another 227 new individuals take their place.",

With the closures, the COVID-19 pandemic reached a new and even more dangerous level for our children in these communities. The lack of structure, support, and positive influence of school and out-of-school time activities has forced many youth to fail academically, with some turning to criminal activity and violence. Students from underserved communities have limited exposure to a variety of opportunities, especially for a career in science and technology. Some students don’t identify with the potential of being an engineer or a scientist. And, with most of our students being from low-income families, opportunities of learning about technology and science, careers in such fields, and entrepreneurship is less available and attainable."

The non-completion rates for Boyle Heights, Watts, and Inglewood are 55%, 49%, and 27%, respectively. Statistically, students who don't complete high school are subjected to increased experiences of poverty and crime. They are four times more likely to be unemployed and over eight times more likely to be incarcerated. Even once students from these communities attend college, studies have shown that BIPOC students are much less likely to complete their college education than their peers from different neighborhoods.

Public schools do not have sufficient resources for consistent arts education, and teachers must seek supplemental programming outside the classroom. There is also a need to offer recent college graduates and entry-level creative professionals meaningful creative industry employment opportunities and professional development experiences, especially those from underserved and socio-economically disadvantaged communities.

The youth we work with continue to contend with the economic and racial inequity that has plagued the Watts area since its inception and has formed the root of the gang conflicts and divides in the first place. The outcomes we hope to achieve through this program is that participants expand their understanding of career opportunities and the education and/or training needed to pursue their individual career goals. Participants gain the practical and soft skills needed to secure their first job.Participants build meaningful connections with Black and brown industry professionals across a variety of industries, and gain the capacity to independently search and apply for jobs. Companies engaged build their understanding of systemic barriers to economic success for young Black people and expand opportunities available to them. Ultimately, PeacePlayers Los Angeles aims to address inequities and help bridge the divides in Watts and South LA by creating safe spaces through the game of basketball for young people to build friendships across community divisions, help develop youth leaders who advocates for their neighborhood, find access to resources and opportunities, and build a network of youth leaders in Watts, LA, and beyond.",

Similarly, Elpus found that 86% of music teachers entering the profession were also white and middle class. There is a significant lack of diversity across the spectrum of music, including at the educational and professional levels. According to a survey of industry professionals, 83% reported that a majority of their company’s leadership positions were held by white people. Similarly, a study conducted by the Martin Prosperity Institute revealed that 73.8% of all creative class jobs nationwide are held by white workers.

While music education will always remain our primary focus, we know from internal data that our impact extends beyond teaching students how to play a musical instrument. “Music has kept me sane. It helps me express myself, it also helps me with my emotional intelligence. I feel free, calm, and like myself in music. It's something I enjoy getting lost in and it helps me with my depression and anxiety. When I play music, it feels like I'm on another planet by myself where the only things that matter are me and my music,” one of our students wrote.",

Participating students will receive lessons, guidance, and supervision from various teaching artists with expertise in songwriting/composing, spoken word/hip-hop, recording, performing, mixing, and contemporary music history. Students will learn about every stage of the music production process and create a song that explores self-identity/social issues. All of the songs will be combined into a final session album that will be released both as a physical CD and on digital platforms such as SoundCloud. The class will also collaboratively create album artwork, develop a marketing strategy, and establish a release timeline. The production and performance processes covered in this course will intersect with lessons in math, science, and social-emotional learning as well as include the following social justice elements: - Deconstructing and subverting gender roles/expectations in the studio; - Democratizing access to music production technology; - Demystifying music production and music business processes; - Nurture a collaborative and supportive environment for student-led creativity. - Utilize non-punitive classroom management techniques rooted in restorative and transformative justice."

With landmark cases like the Bruce’s Beach land reparation in Manhattan Beach, the growth of groups like Color the Water and Ebony Beach Club, and events like Nick Gabaldon Day, A Great Day in the Stoke (organized by a CTW surfer) and the Paddle for Peace, communities of color are seeking access to the beach like never before. Still, the prevalent culture of the beach and particularly of surfing leaves many feeling unsafe. Whether it be the egregious racist incidents that gain headlines or the microaggressions we face as we enter into surf spaces, our sense of safety on a predominantly white coast still requires great and clear intention. As BIPOC that have been marginalized from the ocean through historically segregated beaches, lack of access to the coast, and minimal resources for water recreation and safety, these are barriers to equitable ocean access for us.",

Our goal is to offer our surf lessons and safe space to 1,000 people this year. We will also quadruple our volunteer base from 5 currently to 20 qualified volunteers. Additionally, we will create surf and water safety tutorials, courses, and tell stories that will help ensure community safety not only internally, but across our network of partners and allies. Long term: Color the Water’s mission is grounded in the truth that surfing was meant as a communal, reverent, inclusive practice.

CTW’s greatest strength is that we are led and run by members of the same marginalized community we serve. Having BIPOC instructors and facilitators is part of the safe space we curate, and in order to meet the needs of our growing community, we need to provide surf instruction and water safety training for our community of surfers who are now ready to instruct and contribute. Also, as practitioners and advocates of racial justice, proper training on sound anti-racist and BIPOC centered practices is crucial. - BIPOC-centered surf instructional and educational media. CTW’s intention to create a cultural paradigm shift in surf culture will be made possible through media materials like tutorials, educational pieces, and storytelling. The spreading of this message of equitable ocean access and safe practices will create a cultural shift that has the opportunity to change a system of oppression that has kept BIPOC away from outdoor access.",

As our membership grows, we will be able to identify where there are information gaps--or true gaps in service. We can shine a light where services or funding are critically needed. And we can investigate solutions with our university-affiliated members, building deeper relationships between academia and our community organizations.

The work is already happening through multiple collaboratives across LA County organized by client type or service type (from our membership: foster youth, unaccompanied minors; child abuse prevention, anti-violence). Overnight when the COVID-19 pandemic began, service providers pivoted to email and Zoom. PDFs of events are shared in email newsletters and Dropbox folders, or dropped into Zoom chats; requests for referrals get blasted to mass email lists (and into spam). As we adjust to our new normal, we need a better way forward incorporating the best of what we've learned the last two years. We won't go back to attending all meetings in person--but nor can we do our best work with what began as emergency measures. The Coalition Platform is that way forward: a thoughtful, secure, organized hub to find the resources we need, and connect with the people who provide them."

For the past two years, through partnership with LA Commons, youth activists ages 13-18 created participant-driven designs of equitable communities, specifically for mental health and sustainability. Design is a powerful framework for tackling injustice as it is a reflective and collaborative exchange of ideas and a catalyst for community change. It provides an understanding of equity and social-emotional learning and focuses on developing leadership and empathy. In the past, our youth activists have designed mental wellness parks, community gardens, and pet cafes that provided emotional support and were gender-inclusive. We will continue to build upon these successful, participant-driven activities this year by expanding our charret curriculum to incorporate themes of designing with empathy, centering community voices and programming in neighborhoods. Through A+A workshops, participants will transform the conversation around cultural identity and space into the study of canonical and local sustainability practices by documenting cultural motifs in their neighborhoods in a “mind mapping” art installation.

Experts agree heat pumps are a critical if often overlooked solution to this problem. Heat pumps significantly reduce energy needs (estimates tend to cite 15-20%) to do the same job, keeping us comfortable and protecting us from extreme temperatures. Existing companies have only made incremental improvements, and have not been leveraging emerging technologies, or pursuing sustainable development as aggressively as this problem demands.

In our Edible Schoolyard Program, students experience garden and kitchen lessons that integrate ecological concepts with real-life applications. Driven by the California State Standards, our garden and kitchen projects connect learning in the areas of Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, and Physical Education. At Larchmont Charter School, the Edible Schoolyard (ESY) is an invaluable tool in helping us to achieve our mission of providing an exceptional public education to a diverse community through a project-based, constructivist approach to teaching and learning. While our current program is strong, we haven’t had the resources to build the capacity to broaden it for the most impact. Funds from 2050 will allow ESY teachers to meet, plan, align and grow the curriculum to make certain the experience is robust from K-12th grade. Increased time to plan as a team, increased materials for students to use in the garden, more plants, and trees to watch and learn from, and more time to use fruits and vegetables from the garden in the school kitchens will increase consciousness of the benefits of eating locally grown, organic food, furthering awareness of food choices and their impact on the planet as a whole."

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "There is a paucity of resources for high-achieving STEM students in LA. This grant will help us bring together students with high interest and potential in math from underserved backgrounds, students who may otherwise never attend a summer camp, let alone explore advanced math. After summer programs, BEAM students return to their schools with a new mathematical perspective and enrich their classroom environments. As students continue with BEAM, we help them access strong high schools and prepare students to major in STEM in college. Ultimately, our goal is for our students to graduate with STEM majors and enter STEM careers. Such careers offer financial stability and prestige that can benefit individuals, families, and entire communities. In the long term, we are working to change the face of STEM in LA and nationwide, bringing a diverse range of life experiences and perspectives to the work, and making STEM more responsive to the needs of all.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "At BEAM, we provide 10 years of support to students beginning in middle school and continuing through college to ensure they can succeed in STEM. This grant will support our middle school programs. Our programming begins with BEAM Discovery, a 5-week summer program for rising 7th graders. At Discovery, students do 200 hours of math over the summer and build a close-knit community of kids who love math. They choose their own classes (like Truth, Lies, and Logic; Mysterious Patterns; and Astronomy), solve math puzzles on teams as part of relays, and work together to solve 100 challenging problems (and win a prize for everyone). Students also do fun activities like soccer, chess, and origami. Many students tell us it is the first time they’ve been challenged in math. Discovery completers can apply to BEAM Summer Away, a 3-week residential summer program on a college campus for rising 8th graders. At Summer Away, students do advanced math that others might not study until college (like number theory or combinatorics) and build friendships for a lifetime. They do 7 hours of math a day (they love it!), take a field trip to Six Flags, hear talks from mathematicians, and even learn to do their own laundry. For many students, it’s their first time away from home. To our knowledge, BEAM is the only organization in the country providing comprehensive, long-term support to ensure success in advanced mathematics for students from low-income and historically marginalized communities.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "At our summer programs, students consistently grow in their problem-solving skills, in their stamina for solving difficult problems, and in their interest in math. A large majority of students participating in our 8th grade support program are admitted to selective high schools that offer calculus and prepare students for college. Many students earn spots at competitive STEM programs like Canada/USA Mathcamp and NASA internships. Finally, almost 70% of our high school students are admitted to Barron's-designated \"very competitive\" colleges. Our students tell us that BEAM has an overwhelmingly positive impact. Kaylin wrote: “BEAM has changed my perspective of learning forever. This program has helped boost my confidence, makes me love math and learning, and shows me skills that will help me in the future.” Olivia said: “If it weren’t for BEAM, I would have never learned about the Fibonacci sequence and Pascal’s pyramid, and I would have never seen numbers in such a beautiful way!”",

Yet across STEM, Black and Latinx people in particular are dramatically underrepresented. Too often even students with high interest and potential in STEM from these communities have few high-quality STEM learning opportunities in school and out of school. Many have limited access to calculus in high school, a necessity for STEM success in college. Black and Latinx students also have fewer opportunities to take STEM AP classes, and are under-enrolled even when they express strong interest. In college, Black and Latinx students declare STEM majors at the same rate as their white and Asian peers, but many more Black and Latinx students switch from STEM majors or leave college altogether for a variety of reasons, chief among them that they are underprepared, unsupported academically, and face bias and other socioemotional challenges.",

Green space can help make low-income neighborhoods less vulnerable to climate and health risks by lowering temperatures and improving air quality. Access to parks encourages community building and family bonding by providing an attractive, natural space for fun activities and social connections. 55% of children in LA County foster care are Latino and 27% are Black. The Western Gage neighborhood is among the highest in LA County for justice-involved youth. While we do not have illusions that one neighborhood park can fix systemic problems, this park could make life healthier and more active for the people who fought to build it. This park could be a respite and a place of joy for the community's youth. This park could transform lives the same way it's transforming two once blighted lots.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Building on our years of prior community engagement about the Western Gage Park, LANI will review and expand our list of local stakeholders and form a Median Park Steering Committee with broad representation. The Committee's role is to select a park designer, take part in the design process, advise on the best tools and places to engage the community, and share progress and information with their neighbors. With the Committee's input, we will craft a community engagement strategy tailored to the local people who will ultimately use the park. The Committee will meet many times over the grant period, and stay in touch via e-mail in between meetings for updates, questions and discussion. Our community engagement model favors \"taking it to the streets,\" tabling at local events or even at the future park site, meeting with community groups, and/or hosting workshops to share information and solicit community input. We will have at least 4, and as many as 8, community engagement events. Online surveys will invite residents to share specific park amenities and design concepts they would like to see. Once the community has given their input and the design is made, LANI will host a street fair-style groundbreaking celebration on the site. The event will be an opportunity to showcase the park's final designs, but also to celebrate this hard-fought, transformative success resulting in the building of Western Gage Park after 25 years of sustained community advocacy.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The evidence that we have that the Western Gage Park is working to address a problem is the park itself. This project, and LANI's involvement, began in 2007, and it is due to the persistence of the community that it is being fulfilled now. Originally funded through the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) of the City of Los Angeles, the project was in jeopardy when the CRA was dissolved in 2012. But the community persisted, and with LANI's help, received State Parks grant funding to start the project, resulting in the building of the Tot Lot on the smaller parcel. Residents in block clubs, churches and neighborhood groups were steadfast advocates for years to ensure that their representatives did not forget this project. Their commitment, even when the way forward was unclear, is evidence that the LANI Model of substantive community engagement does empower residents to be effective proponents of their needs and interests, and results in neighborhood goals being accomplished.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Los Angeles County’s urban park system is scarred with the historic impacts of inequitable investment and racialized land-use decisions. 82% of LA County's “park poor” neighborhoods are in communities of color; 96% of residents within a 1/2-mile of Western Gage Park are Black or Latino. Low-income residents and people of color are more likely to live in hotter neighborhoods and be exposed to higher levels of air pollution, in part because they have fewer parks. They are also more likely to suffer the health impacts of heat waves than residents of richer, greener neighborhoods. Lack of parks also impacts youth development. Youth justice reformers agree that proactive, neighborhood-level youth and whole-community development -- including investment in safe, community-designed green spaces for exercise, recreation and nature access -- is essential to prevent youth system-involvement and promote physical and mental health. Urban parks uplift and enrich disadvantaged communities."

After graduating from college, Fellows move into housing provided by the program, participate in a pre-service Summer Institute, and then work as teaching assistants under master teachers as they earn their teaching credential through our partnerships with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the CalStateTEACH credentialing programs. ● Addresses the emotional, cultural, and soft skills development that are not the strength of the credentialing programs. The Village supplements those programs with additional workshops, professional mentoring, and peer support from within the cohort. ● Provides housing until a new teacher is fully certified and has secured a teaching position.

Students in marginalized communities faced even tougher challenges, with fewer supplemental education resources nearby. Our landscape analysis of STEM education organizations in LA County shows vast swaths of south and east LA that are “STEM deserts.” The pandemic further impacted learning across the board and widen the gap for disadvantaged students. At the end of the 2020-2021 school year, an analysis by McKinsey found that unfinished learning exacerbated historical inequities, especially for Black students. While students, on average, finished the year five months behind in Math & Science, children in majority Black schools were six months behind, and students in low-income schools were seven.",

As we move into in-person classroom and community-based work, we will begin to track and measure the engagement of individual students and youth. In the short term, we will define success by increasing the number of BIPOC students and youth that participate in our programs. In the longer term, we will measure success by considering the following: • Student and family responses to program surveys assessing their value of STEM learning. • The number of local youth who pursue academic STEM pathways. • The number of local youth who pursue STEM careers.",

Further, the coordinated organizations of the Collective and their resources will be leveraged to open access to opportunities for students and communities that have traditionally been underrepresented in STEM. From this work, LA County will see its levels of STEM literacy grow and the diversity of its STEM workforce increase. However, the impact of the success of the Collective will go beyond STEM. Because STEM skills cut across all aspects of a person’s life, from creativity to critical thinking, the Collective envisions a region full of joyful children and youth who are excited, confident and prepared to chart any future they want, affecting their own lives and the future of their communities and the world.",

    "Describe the specific role of the partner organization(s) in the project, program, or initiative.": "While not a collaborative proposal, the “From Homeless to Homeowner” campus has coordition and collaboration as its core. The project will help create the Southeast/East community’s first all-inclusive housing and services campus for families experiencing homeless. With TWC as lead, the campus is a private-public partnership with the Richman Group, a developer with significant experience in affordable rentals, and Habitat for Humanity, widely recognized and respected for bringing homeownership opportunities for families who are low-income. Each partner contributes our specific area of expertise and will work collaboratively to provide a seamless transition from homelessness to housing permanency, respecting and to stability, based on each family’s needs.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Pilot or new project, program, or initiative",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "As homelessness continues to be a great concern, TWC keeps the needs of families experiencing homelessness at the forefront. Family homelessness, often a mom and 2 to 3 children, is on the rise. A LA Times 2021 editorial stated “more than 5,000 of the county’s 58,000 homeless people are children.” Impact on our youngest citizens is traumatic. As a 65-year provider of children’s services, TWC understands and uses guiding principles: every child deserves a quality place to call home, reducing the length/depth of child homelessness curbs the cycle of generational homelessness, and helping parents resolve crises keeps children out of substandard housing. TWC targets Southeast county, which has no interim housing for families. Resources are 9 units in one shelter, available only to mothers with children ages 12 and under. Families with 2 parents or teens are separated and sheltered elsewhere, if beds can be found, or placed in a motel, which is unsuitable for families with young children.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "With a focus on systems change and family stability, TWC and partners will evaluate the benefit of “From Homeless to Homeowner” as a model for moving families from homelessness to highest possible level of independence. TWC has an excellent track record in helping placed families retain housing, a 98% average over the past 3 years. TWC will look at the impact on housing needs in Southeast/East Los Angeles County, which has no interim housing for families. Current resources are limited in number and scope, causing families to leave their local community. TWC sees benefits from reducing transiency and keeping them in a community they know and close to their service system. They can continue in and benefit from their mental health care, substance abuse recovery, education and work training. Children will remain in their schools where they know teachers and have friends. This will increase stability in their lives and improve sustainability as families stay in their local support system.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "As the cornerstone of the “From Homeless to Homeowner” campus, TWC’s Interim Housing Project will address complexities of homelessness among families, allow families to remain together, be assisted with service needs right on campus, and answer their greatest concern by helping chart a permanent path out of homelessness. The project is TWC’s part of a partnership to create a campus of coordinated options to help families transition from homelessness to stable housing to successful owners of their first homes. It will have 40 interim housing units, 89 permanent supportive housing units and 21 ownership units, supported by an on-site Supportive Services Center. TWC is project lead and is building the Interim Housing/Service Center. Partners are Richman Group for permanent housing and Habitat for Humanity for ownership. Once constructed, TWC will provide 6 to 9 months of safe housing in units shared by families, as we help solve issues that caused homelessness and locate permanent housing at the complex or in the community. The onsite Service Center will be open to all campus residents and help 150 families a year. TWC will offer case management, life skills training, children’s mental health services, parent training, nutrition education, family mentoring, education and employment support, domestic violence counseling, financial literacy training and connections to financial benefits, health, childcare and legal assistance provided by on-site and community-based partners.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "TWC’s Interim Housing and Supportive Services Center will make life better for some of our community’s most vulnerable citizens as well as have broad public benefit. We will increase housing stock needed to address the homeless epidemic; improve the lives of homeless families and their young children; and impact homelessness in the low-income communities of Southeast Los Angeles County. Working with the campus’ other components, TWC will provide a coordinated progression from homelessness to stability. As the first crucial step, TWC’s housing will give families a place to stay where they are welcome, accepted, safe and supported as we help them with stability plans for housing placement and permanency. The project will integrate housing stability with service solutions and increase critically-needed affordable housing. In a strategic way and at a single location, TWC and partners will provide solutions to recurring homelessness among families and the complexity of barriers they face.",

Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute completed a study on the impact of our work, published (9/21) in JAMA Ophthalmology. This study demonstrated that students with glasses made higher gains in reading and math, at levels exceeding the gains of other far more expensive common educational interventions like charter schools, extended school days, or one-on-one technology. In fact, on average, students made additional gains on the level that would be expected from adding an additional two to four months of class time. UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital found that children provided glasses can be expected to show improvements in math and reading, higher self-esteem and better class participation.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Students with uncorrected vision avoid reading, suffer headaches, and have trouble focusing on class, as 80% of their learning is visual. These children are more likely to fail a grade, and less likely to read by 3rd grade – a milestone critical to preventing dropout. Up to 70% of those in the juvenile legal system have uncorrected vision problems. The need is urgent, as the pandemic has caused significant learning loss. More than 200,000 LA students are not meeting grade-level goals in math and reading – foundations of STEAM learning. The pandemic exacerbated systemic achievement gaps. Children of color experienced greater stress and their schools and families had less resources for distance learning. Last week, a 2nd grader received his glasses. He was so excited to try them out that he ran towards the word wall in the classroom. Stopping 10 feet away from the wall, he began to read the words aloud, twirled, and whispered, “I can see.”",

VTL measures the number of students provided vision care by tracking vision screenings, exams, glasses, and vision correction in a secure, cloud-based Electronic Medical Records (EMR) database, updated in real time by optometric staff in our mobile clinics. VTL’s EMR tracks results by student, mobile clinic, school district, and geographic area, allowing us to report program successes due to the LA 2050 program. A recent Johns Hopkins/Wilmer Eye Institute 3-year controlled study has shown that students recovered significant learning time due to VTL’s program as measured by standardized test results. This is critical to closing the learning gap that has emerged with the pandemic.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Vision care at school overcomes systemic barriers to access such as parents’ inability to take time off from work, misunderstanding about need and cost of vision care, lack of quality vision care providers in underserved neighborhoods, and high transportation costs. Vision To Learn' overcomes these access barriers by bringing exams and glasses directly to students at school. Vision To Learn is building a reimbursement process to obtain public support for our program through Medicaid and thus will serve as a groundbreaking model for bringing health care directly to schools sustainably supported by public reimbursement. VTL’s Screening and Examination process is: 1. VTL schedules and performs vision screenings using a Welch Allyn Spot Vision Screener, to determine which students have vision difficulties. All students are screened, regardless of insurance or citizenship status. 2. VTL’s mobile clinic comes to the school, where trained opticians and optometrists conduct eye exams for every student who fails their vision screening. 3. If students need glasses, they choose a frame from a wide selection on the clinic. Glasses are delivered approximately three weeks later. 4. If a child loses/breaks their glasses within one year, VTL replaces them free of charge. 5. VTL returns every two years to provide continuity of care at schools."

The AAPI community will be engaged in a non-intimidating environment that fosters open conversations around mental health. Cultural values around communication and suppressing emotions, which contribute to the success of the community, also act as barriers to acknowledging the need for help and accessing services. The program will help youth and families break down these barriers. For the long term, with reduced stigma, increased awareness, access to therapy and community engagement, ultimately the AAPI community will improve its collective mental health and fewer youth and young adults will be lost to suicide.",

However, mental health remains a highly stigmatized and ‘taboo’ subject in AAPI communities. The need for youth mental health is supported by the disturbing upward trend in suicide rates. Data from the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health indicates suicide is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans 20-24 years old. The pandemic and Asian hate crimes have only added to the reasons for why support for AAPI mental health care is vitally urgent. People who identify as AAPI are searching for mental health resources more in 2020 than ever before. The added vulnerability is that this group also has the most uninsured, creating a financial barrier to accessing care. Traditional models of mental health clinics have not been successful in reaching vulnerable youth communities.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "LTSC’s “Changing Tides” (CT) seeks to inspire greater mental health discussion within the AAPI community, challenges the associated stigma and dares to change the way mental health is viewed with three programs: “Changing Tides Stream” offsets the costs of approximately 6-10 non-acute therapy sessions for those seeking therapy for the first time and/or for those unable to afford therapy. The program is open to youth/young adults 16-25 years old in Los Angeles and the South Bay areas of LA County. After CT receives an application, the stipend program coordinator works with the client to determine the best way to utilize the stipend. On the back end, CT works with its network of 45 mental health professionals to offer therapist-client matches and to assist with enrollment. The program is supported by continued post-stipend services to ensure that the program addresses the stigma, monetary needs, and emotional needs of program participants. CT continues the conversation surrounding mental health and stigma within the AAPI community with mental health discussions, workshops led by mental health professionals, community advocates and those willing to share their own mental health journeys in peer support groups and podcasts. Third, an “Art Talk” series invites participants to engage in an artistic practice while also considering the ways in which art plays a role in mental health. Each Art Talk consists of a workshop followed by a small group discussion led by CT facilitator."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The housing affordability crisis in California has upended and destabilized many low-income LA communities. Low income communities, predominantly Latinx and Black after years of segregation and redlining, have been especially hard hit by the housing crisis. Between 2001 and 2019, Los Angeles lost over 26,500 rent stabilized units through Ellis Act evictions. In 2019, the population of homeless individuals in the City of Los Angeles increased by 16% from the previous year. Tenant harassment and/or lack of building maintenance in communities of color is constant in order to push out tenants and garner higher rents for buildings. In neighborhoods where new housing is being built, market rate housing is now so expensive that many current residents of LA cannot afford it. In order to address housing affordability and homelessness in LA, we must advance policies that increase production of affordable housing, preserve existing low-cost housing, and enact strong protections for tenants.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "ACT-LA and its coalition partners have been advocating for solutions to the housing affordability crisis through the Housing Element of the General Plan, also called \"the Plan to House LA,\" which identifies Los Angeles's housing needs and opportunities and establishes clear goals and objectives to inform future housing decisions. Due in part to the work of ACT-LA and its coalition partners, the recently adopted (May 2022) Housing Element includes a non-binding commitment by the City of Los Angeles to create 10,000 units of affordable housing on public land. While this goal is a “on-paper” victory for communities, it does not have an enforcement nor accountability mechanism. For affordable housing to be built, communities need to continue to actively advocate for their needs and interests. One of the biggest obstacles to affordable housing development is the cost of land. Fortunately, Los Angeles has access to existing public lands which can be activated for the purpose of creating new affordable housing. ACT-LA and its coalition partners propose to continue to engage the City in following through with plans to implement the Housing Element by educating and organizing Los Angeles residents on the existence of these public lands and how they could be used to create permanently affordable housing. We will assemble the necessary coalitions and teams to bring this aspect of the Housing Element into fruition.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If successful, we will have created a strong, organized coalition of affordable developers, tenant groups, and residents that can work with the City to reach its commitment of 10,000 new units of permanently affordable housing, and Los Angeles will have a model for how communities can use public lands for public good and create more affordable housing in places where access to land is at a premium. Our intention is to use the collective voice of organized constituencies and the institutions of democratic government to create the public goods we need, especially in housing where the market has failed. This grant will allow us to activate bilingual community engagement specialists from affected neighborhoods to educate residents about how to leverage public lands in a cost effective and efficient way. Resident engagement will shape the kind of city we want to live in and use the government resources available to make sure that they are used effectively for the public good."

However, political and community opposition to such developments—often called “NIMBYism” (not in my backyard)—can impede providers’ ability to implement these solutions. This opposition is often based on incorrect assumptions about who people experiencing homelessness are and what such developments will bring to their neighborhoods, such as crime. As such, ending this crisis requires not only more housing and direct services, but broader community education and political will to be part of the solution. To dispel these myths and build community buy-in, we must humanize the experience of homelessness by elevating authentic voices of those with lived experience.",

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Immigrant and Refugee Support",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The Problem: We saw the stressed faces of the parents long before the Journal of Pediatrics published their report (3.7.2022) that infants born during the pandemic were testing lower on language, social and small motor development. So many of their families carried their children to Baby College with the child clutching the parent apprehensively, making single syllable sounds, looking terrified. Sixteen-month-old G. screamed for 45 minutes when his mother brought him to the playroom. He lay prone on the floor, arms outstretched, inconsolable. He had been born during the pandemic and had never been outside his home. He was isolated with his depressed mother and a tablet screen. We are not childcare. We are a parenting program. We had never seen this inability to self-regulate. Each parent was asking “Is my child autistic?”",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our question, as posed by the JAMA (Journal of American Medical Association 3.7.222),” What is the cause of this spike in neurological delays we are observing?” Was it caused by Covid exposure or families under extreme stress and isolation? The early studies released say that it is not correlated to the child or the mother having Covid in utero. Our programs use a therapeutic model for the whole family to heal the damage caused by Covid-19, such as social isolation, child abuse, food instability, and weakened bonds between parent and child. Our team is committed to our progressive Reggio-Emilia therapeutic play-based model program. Our goal is to increase attachment between the parent and child. Research indicates this positive relationship promotes language, self-regulation (and less tantrums), and higher cognitive development. Child Abuse: We have reinstated our bilingual parent support groups “Non-Violent Parenting.” Many parents have shared that they have been depressed during the Pandemic. They find themselves in extreme behaviors of yelling, ignoring the child or using corporal punishment. Food Instability: We have a weekly fresh fruits and vegetable food distribution program. To decrease social isolation, our families and staff celebrate community events such as ‘Immigrants Matter’ Community Art Show, Dia de los Ninos, Dia de los Muertos, Indigenous Peoples Month, and Chinese New Year. Parent after parent testifies, “Baby College saved my baby.”",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our Non-Violent Parenting Program has served over 200 families this year in East LA providing a safe and positive environment where families actively engage in bonding and building trust-based relationships. Parents reported (Guidubaldi-Clemshaw Parent Education Satisfaction Scale, ACE Stress Assessment, Veteran’s Adm. PTSD) to using more effective ways to parent and deal with post-traumatic stress issues. Specifically, parents reported their children’s growth (through ASQ survey) in the use of academic language, self-regulation, and conflict resolution skills. Additionally, we empower parents to advocate for themselves and their children when needing access to health, education and special needs intervention services. Our goal is 100% post-enrollment in pre-K, TK or Kindergarten, Early Intervention or Special Needs Services.",

Our goal is to develop strong effective attachment between children and parents, which will build a foundation of efficacy, purpose and love. Long Term Hundreds of families will experience the benefits of Non-violent Parenting taught in our workshops. Our programs connect with these Latinx children who will grow into productive, self-actuated healthy adults, making LA in 2050 (when these US citizen children are in their 30’s), a better place to live.

Everyone then goes outside to get fitted for one of the many refurbished bicycles provided, given a new bicycle helmet and divided up into groups based on skill. Professional athletes including members of the US Olympic cycling team and volunteers teach the kids basic cycling and safety skills like how to turn, stop, ride in a straight line and signal. By coupling this education with the opportunity to learn from professional athletes the kids are more engaged and thus more likely to retain the lessons. Lunch is provided before everyone does a 1 mile group ride on closed roads concluding with the kids crossing an official Finish Line where they all get their own finishing medal and other free swag. As a special surprise, those children who doesn't have their own bicycles are allowed to keep the ones they rode on. They're also offered a free bicycle lock.

In other words, vertiports will be developed in places and communities that, until now, did not have to contend with aviation infrastructure. Development efforts will most certainly contend with NIMBYism and the myriad needs and wants of each community. Furthermore, the prospect of developing dozens, if not hundreds, of micro-airports simultaneously within LA is unprecedented. While AAM offers tremendous social, economic, and environmental benefits, it stands to reason that before AAM can reach its potential, the industry needs a systematic way to manage public and community acceptance at scale (ie, multiple simultaneous developments). One such process is the design charrette, which we plan to adapt specifically to AAM in LA.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "This proposal is to develop an AAM Design Charrette Toolkit to facilitate discussions, implementation plans, and development agreements between city officials, community members, and AAM industry partners. Design charrettes are commonly used in the planning and development process, and we believe it is the most appropriate solution to the problem. However, the scale and impact of AAM warrants a standardized, AAM-specific process, much like the guidance provided by the Department of Transportation for EV charging infrastructure. Our effort will be divided into two phases: research and documentation. The research phase will involve meeting with the above stakeholders, collecting feedback (eg, needs and desired outcomes) on the development of AAM infrastructure, and identifying areas of discourse for a charrette program. Focus will be placed on answering this question for each stakeholder: “What information do I need or want to proceed with this development?” This will enable the design charrette program to be structured to manage this information in the most effective manner. The documentation phase will involve the preparation of charrette materials including educational information about AAM, typical agendas, design checklists, vignettes and info-graphics, mood boards, and KPI’s, etc. This material will be reviewed with key stakeholders and compiled into a comprehensive and interactive Toolkit that will be available online to all AAM stakeholders."

    "summary": "The Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI)’s Equity Innovation Program (EIP) is a strategic, additive layer of support for underrepresented cleantech entrepreneurs within LACI’s small business incubation and acceleration programs. EIP offers cleantech founders access to targeted coaching and curriculum, pilot funding, and technical guidance to help secure financing, expand their network, or scale their startups, so they can help the City of Los Angeles achieve its ambitious climate goals by the year 2050.",

    "projectRanking": "Winner",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "BIPOC- and Women-Owned Businesses",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Within the cleantech sector, entrepreneurs who are women; Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC), often face barriers accessing capital, networking, and developing and piloting prototypes that their white, often male, counterparts do not. During the pandemic, these entrepreneurs were disproportionately impacted by Covid-19 challenges and setbacks. In order to meet LA regional climate goals, LACI is providing additional support to underrepresented entrepreneurs who seek to combat climate change and protect the environment for all Angelinos. Kameale C. Terry, a founder of ChargerHelp!, a LACI startup that repairs electric vehicle charging stations to ensure reliable access to EV charging, said in a Reuters article that LACI was key to securing a $2.75-million investment. “As a startup with two black female founders, it’s been critical to have LACI help guide us, mentor us, and help find investors.” Companies like ChargerHelp! are a model for LACI’s Equity Innovation Program.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 60",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "LACI’s Equity Innovation Program aims to help level the playing field for historically underserved and underrepresented founders, who often encounter additional barriers to success when compared to their white, male counterparts. Once invited into one of our Incubation Programs, any female, BIPOC or otherwise underrepresented participants can apply to access: 1) increased funding for clean technology pilots in partnership with frontline communities; 2) additional 1:1 coaching and support services; and 3) increased access to funding to scale their startups and grow their businesses. We measure the impact of EIP by our ability to support our startups to raise the same amount of capital as their white male peers within the cleantech sector. We define success as the creation of more living wage jobs with a focus on hiring un/underemployed people from local disadvantaged communities, access to additional capital, credit and funding, and increased revenue generation.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LACI envisions a future where the City of Los Angeles and its people flourish. If our work is successful, Los Angeles will become a thriving metropolis with zero emissions transportation, clean air, high paying green jobs, and a circular economy that supports generations of Angelinos to come. The LA2050 grant will bridge persistent opportunity gaps and deliver additional support to underserved entrepreneurs by directly funding innovative cleantech pilots for our Equity Innovation Program. In the short term, EIP aims to achieve measurable success: more capital raised, cleantech pilots deployed, green jobs created, and positive environmental, economic and social impact created for communities. Our long term vision is to prioritize, strengthen, and incentivize innovation ecosystems for Los Angeles’ diverse entrepreneurs who are championing scalable solutions to climate change and who seek to achieve the ambitious regional sustainability goals of the Los Angeles Green New Deal (pLAn).",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "City of Los Angeles",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "LACI’s Equity Innovation Program is unique because it directly impacts women and underrepresented founders in Los Angeles by improving access to knowledge and tools that will help accelerate the road to commercialization of clean technologies, and with more funding, EIP founders can go further, faster. In partnership with LA2050, we see an exciting opportunity to provide additional pilot funding to our EIP startups in order to create solutions for the Los Angeles community and scale their businesses. LACI pilots are prototype deployments of clean technologies and businesses that bring the benefits of the green economy to the City of Los Angeles. Lessons from these pilot projects are widely shared and used to inform new projects and policy recommendations within the Southern California region. In order to provide proof of concept for clean technology solutions, LACI executes cleantech pilots in collaboration with our startups. For example, community-based organization Pacoima Beautiful, LACI startup Envoy, and Nissan launched the Pacoima Electro-Share community EV car-share program which provided direct and affordable access to EVs that were powered by a resilient charging solution using off-grid technology. Additionally, Envoy, and Nissan launched the Rancho San Pedro Electric Car Share. This pilot is providing a zero emission transportation option to the members of the affordable housing community, helping residents to connect to the City of Los Angeles more easily."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "More than 70% of jobs today require college degrees, yet enrollment among low-income students has declined dramatically since 2020. Those who do matriculate are also less likely to persist than before the pandemic, and college graduation remains significantly lower among underserved students. However, students need more than just postsecondary credentials to qualify for well-paying jobs; “soft skills” such as time management, problem-solving and conflict management are repeatedly cited as one of the most important factors in hiring. Often, low-income students do not have ready training in their families/communities to succeed in those first jobs. While a college education remains incredibly valuable, it is also more expensive. 1 in 8 Americans has college debt; households earning less than $35K a year average $30K in loans. Without proper guidance to pursue careers that lead to economic mobility, low-income students risk becoming un-or under-employed while contending with college debt.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Fulfillment Fund remains the largest nonprofit in L.A. providing college access opportunities for high schoolers AND sticking with them throughout college to ensure they graduate and embark on a successful career path. Our effect is remarkable: • Last year 93% of our high school seniors graduated vs. 81% for LAUSD overall. • Among our graduates, college enrollment approached 100% pre-pandemic and has remained high even during COVID: 82% enrolled in college last year. As context, the LAUSD college-going rate among all seniors in 2020 was 59%. • Last year 95% of our college students were persisting towards their degrees or graduated. In comparison, only ~25% of LAUSD high school graduates finish college within six years, while our most recent cohort attained a 92% six-year graduation rate. The national average is 63%, which includes students of all backgrounds and income levels. Our career readiness initiatives currently include a Career Speaker Series (featuring professionals from a variety of fields), Career Expo (structured networking), skills workshops (resume writing, interviewing, etc.), experiential practice, and connections to exclusive jobs/paid internships. With grant funding we look to grow our impact by enhancing and expanding this work, combining current activities under a newly created staff position to lead our Career Readiness program. This will include offering a deeper range of services, more individualized student supports, and engaging new partners.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We seek to create generational change and widen perspectives to break down barriers that divide. For our students, who hail from first-generation families in low-income communities, education is key to breaking the cycle of poverty and forging a path to meaningful economic mobility. We support our 98% BIPOC students to overcome financial roadblocks, cultural expectations and responsibilities, and geographic limitations to give them the opportunities, resources, and skills they need to complete high school, get into college, graduate, and launch into a promising career. Through our work, students not only earn a college degree and start a career that can uplift themselves, but can also add to uplifting L.A. As future employees at L.A. companies with “a seat at the table”, they have a chance to use their diverse lived experiences to break down racial barriers and create greater equity in their companies. Thus, we aim to empower youth for brighter individual and collective futures."

When the City removed an encampment of 111 unhoused people from Little Tokyo in March 2022, the community became divided over the safety of visitors and providing help and services for the unhoused. Toriumi Plaza, the site of the Little Tokyo encampment, was named for Union Church of LA’s Reverend Howard Toriumi (1916-1987). The Plazaʻs plaque is inscribed, \"He was a dedicated leader who galvanized the community and helped save Little Tokyo from the wrecking ball during the turbulent redevelopment years of the 1960s-1970s. He established several community service organizations that expanded and flourished.” Little Tokyo–the city’s second oldest neighborhood, an inaugural California Cultural District, and one of three remaining historic Japantowns in the US–has a long history of activism.

In May 2022, we hosted a roving teach-in through Little Tokyo and Skid Row where participants heard from neighborhood advocates and artists to imagine community-driven ideas and solutions to the housing crisis. Our work, supplemented by staffing to provide ongoing support to the houseless in Little Tokyo, has taken on increased importance following the clearing of people from Toriumi Plaza.

To educate and raise awareness around this issue, we will expand our signature, community-driven partnership, Sustainable Little Tokyo (SLT), to deepen our existing work with Skid Row organizations such as Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA CAN) and Community Arts Depot. Working together, we will provide local artists with paid opportunities to create arts-based, pop-up activations that deepen our community vision around houselessness, housing, and open space. The first pop-up will be devoted to education and awareness building. The second pop-up will connect residents from the adjacent neighborhoods of Little Tokyo and Skid Row using art and recreation, celebrating Little Tokyo as a historical nexus between Japanese American and Black/African American communities. The final pop-up will temporarily actualize the community’s vision for inclusive public spaces. The pop-ups will take place in Little Tokyo public/open spaces, including Toriumi Plaza.

Quantitative output measures include the number of people engaged in activities, partnerships developed, artists served, and projects started and completed. Quantitative outcome measures analyze increased economic activity and community advocacy results. Outcomes may also be more qualitative, such as reflections on what activities mean to participants and perceptions of how the project raises awareness around the issues. We will also assess the process, specifically the efficacy of outreach and engagement activities.

There were nearly 13,000 families experiencing homelessness prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and researchers believe that our current economic crisis may result in up to 600,000 additional people losing their homes over the next three years. However, homelessness is a complex problem that cannot be solved by housing alone. Many interrelated factors, including job and financial instability, domestic violence, and limited support from family and social networks, contribute to an individual family’s housing stability.

Our FPM pairs traditional intensive case management with relationships and resources to help the entire family thrive long-term. We are requesting support for two pillars of our holistic programming – our Economic Mobility Program (EMP) and our Mentorship Program. Imagine LA is best known for its transformative, two-generation Mentorship program. Mentors are caring volunteers from the community who undergo rigorous, equity-forward training and a thoughtful onboarding process to ensure a successful relationship. Each member of the family age 5 and up is hand-matched 1:1 with a mentor based on their personal goals, interests, geography, gender, and background. Mentors provide support and encouragement to mentees as they work to achieve their goals together. The EMP creates whole-family wellness by supporting heads of household to surmount poverty, build wealth, and to thrive long-term.

Caring House was established to ease the burden associated with caring for a loved one at the end of life and/or spending it in a facility, and we’ve transformed the experience into a peaceful and dignified one. Now, instead of worrying about their loved one’s day-to-day needs, family and friends spend their time supporting and connecting with their loved one and each other in our calm, tranquil home-based setting, which has a profoundly positive effect on their mental wellness.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Caring House is the first and only non-profit, home-based setting in LA County completely focused on helping residents and families through the end-of-life journey. Although we opened the doors to our home in early 2016, it was actually 14 years in the making. Community members saw the need in 2022 and began planning to make it a reality. When someone chooses to have their loved one stay with us, it’s not just that loved one who received care. We care for the entire family, so they can leave their worries at our front door, including any financial concerns. If a family cannot afford the full cost of care, they are simply asked to pay to the best of their ability. We cover the difference through support from both individual donors and funding like this. Since we don’t turn anyone away for an inability to pay, we serve families with a wide variety of demographics – from background to socio-economic status – a reflection of the diversity in LA County in general. We also proudly reserve two of our bedrooms for those with much higher financial need, including a small percentage of the homeless population. Our home is also just that, a home. Nestled in a tree-shaded residential neighborhood with a white picket fence and idyllic gardens, our founders purposefully created a calm and tranquil home environment – a home-away-from-home for our families – where the six private bedrooms are designed for peace and dignity, and it smells like home in the form of fresh-baked cookies.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We measure our impact, in part, through residents and families welcomed. Since 2016, we’ve created better endings for more than 400 residents and families, relieving stress for 2,400 community members. Two-thirds of those families were welcomed thanks to generous community support. We’ve recently seen an increased need in our community. Our average occupancy rate and the number of families we’ve served has grown significantly over the past six months, and we’re on track to help approximately 150% more families in 2022 than prior years. However, as the occupancy rate and number of families served grows, so does the percentage of families in need of financial assistance. That also means we can make more people feel the way this daughter does: “Because of Caring House, my dad got to pass with dignity. Thank you for allowing our final memories of my dad to be in a place where he could watch sports and be at peace. I could never repay you for the support you gave us this year.”",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The Stanford School of Medicine reports that 80% of Americans would prefer to die at home, if possible. In reality, 60% die in hospitals, 20% in nursing homes and only 20% at home. Many families are unable or prefer other options for numerous reasons. Most notably, the day-to-day needs required do not allow families to be fully present and process their emotions, while connecting in an intimate way. The alternative is often a medical facility with bright lights and loud noises. We’ve also heard stories of stressful or traumatic experiences around a loved one’s death and the years of anguish that resulted. Then there’s the feedback shared by our families – one such example: \"I never really understood how much taking care of my husband during these last few months was affecting us both. The mental and physical exhaustion was overwhelming. To be able to go back to being his wife instead of his caretaker, even if it was just for one short week, was a gift I will forever be grateful for…\"",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "While many make arrangements about finances following death, so few consider the end-of-life process itself. Once the process begins, everyone is emotional and stressed. Then, overwhelmed with the responsibilities and decisions, countless families have come close to their breaking point during admissions, and conversations often revolve around cost. Our ultimate goal is to relieve that stress, so families can just be families, process their emotions, and experience a peaceful resolution. We are committed to providing the most compassionate, supportive care to our families in partnership with the Medicare-certified hospice of their choice. Together, we take care of all the details that overwhelm the families. We also ask for details about our residents and their preferences, so they truly feel at home and families feel at ease, especially when they’re not around. The family of one resident told us that we changed their entire perception of death, calling it “a beautiful death.”",

As of 2019, nearly 80% of Dorsey High students were considered low-income. Our High School Career Exploration was designed to address the health and income needs of the Dorsey Community. The program helps students develop nutrition knowledge and healthy cooking skills for immediate use in their household. Additionally, we are introducing these students to well-paying careers in the healthcare industry through internships and job shadowing.

The program aims to: ● Build personal nutrition and culinary skills through hands-on cooking classes; ● Expose students to nutrition related healthcare careers through job shadowing and internships; and ● Foster health communication skills as HS students co-teach health-centric lessons to elementary and middle school students. Traditionally, HS culinary education in the United States has focused on workplace readiness for the culinary industry. However, CT’s program seeks to bridge what we view as a gap between culinary education and healthcare training. There is a perfect storm of trends that is amplifying the need for youth to be equipped with nutrition knowledge, and understand the relationship between diet and personal health. Additionally, Common Threads’ conversations with partners suggest that many high school students are responsible for preparing food for their households. We believe that skill-based culinary programs for HS youth can help students develop cooking skills, which are life skills they can apply immediately in their households. Furthermore, with exposure to career pathways in healthcare that require nutrition knowledge, HS youth may be primed as future healthcare professionals.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Evaluation will be critical to the success of this pilot and will include a series of focus groups with high school students to amplify their voices, interests, and feedback about their program experiences, all of which will be used in the subsequent development and improvement of this program. Evaluation will also focus on measuring improvements in students’ social emotional skills like teamwork and leadership. Success will be measured against anticipated first year outputs: ● 45 high school students served ● 150 3rd-5th graders impacted through internship ● 5,200 hours of programming ● 4,680 meals and snacks served ● 750 internship hours Success will also measure improvements in: ● Knowledge of nutrition and healthy eating ● Cultural awareness and appreciation of global recipes and cultures ● Self-efficacy around cooking through skill building ● Job readiness and skill-building through participation in internship ● More outcomes may be added based on preliminary class observations"

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "LA Juvenile detention centers currently have a 64 - 69% recidivism rate. Not only is the recidivism rate astronomically high, but the overall rate of youth incarceration is also disproportionately impacting boys within low-income and communities of color. Early institutionalization into the juvenile justice probation system during adolescence means that even a single mistake in managing aggression, making decisions, or regulating emotions can have severe consequences and inordinately impact the direction of their life. This can cause a vicious cycle of a revolving door if the root causes are not addressed and if our youth are not given proper knowledge, skills, guidance, and support to course-correct their emotional deregulation. Our interactive cognitive-behavioral coaching actively engages teens with immersive virtual reality experiences, and mindfulness/brain training gamification activities coupled with our digital human soft skills job interviewing agent have been transformative.",

In addition, with rising gas prices, the cost to commute is higher than ever. To mitigate this increase in commuter traffic, LAX is launching a subsidized transit program for its employees. Employees will pay $20 a month for a transit pass to cover their commute trips.

As a notoriously congested employment center within LA County, we must focus on changing employee travel behavior by encouraging and incentivizing the use of alternative commute modes as employees return to work. With the 2028 Olympic and Para-Olympic Games, and other large-scale events coming to Los Angeles and surrounding cities, LAX will be the first stop for many visitors. Our efforts will help improve traffic for travelers, employees, and the nearby community.

In 2019, an average of 97,248 vehicles entered the airport daily, and passenger traffic is slowly catching up to 2019 levels. As Angelenos return to air travel and LAX employees return to work, the airport has a unique opportunity to mitigate the impact of employee commute traffic. In 2021, LAWA launched commuteLAX, encouraging employees to leave their cars at home and use alternative commute options like transit, carpool, vanpool, and active transportation. In addition, with transit improvements underway, enhancing connectivity to the airport, employees will be able to access their work location via transit like they never have before. Offering transit passes for free will incentivize employees to consider making a switch to public transportation.",

The grant would cover the $20/month cost, making it free for employees to commute to work via transit for the first 6-8 months of their participation in the program. It is our hope that commuting via public transportation becomes a permanent habit for employees after the free transit program term provided by LA2050 grant funding expires. With numerous bus and train services connecting to LAX, employees switching to public transportation will remove cars off the road. In addition, stress for both the traveler and commuter can be alleviated as a result of reduced single occupancy vehicle traffic. Employees are also able to save money by using a subsidized transit pass, especially as gas prices rise nationwide, and save time by being able to multitask while using public transportation.",

Clients are asked to show that their income will normally cover their needs, so they won’t become homeless the month following service. After the 1-month term, we check back with both the client and the landlord to see if further case management or supportive service referrals are needed to maintain the client in their home. Clients in both programs are assisted in making individual action plans to realize their goals for achieving or maintaining permanent housing, self-reliance and independence. Through involvement with community collaborations, and by coordinating with other social service agencies, both public and private, the program is designed to fill gaps in the existing system of homeless support/prevention services.

The long-term economic impacts of the pandemic, increased costs of living, low-paying jobs, and high rental rates are leaving many low-income families extremely vulnerable for homelessness. Many are living paycheck to paycheck and a job loss or health emergency can quickly derail their finances, and as a result their housing. We receive an average of 100 calls a week requesting shelter; requests for one-time rental assistance have more than doubled during the pandemic years. Our proposed program expansion would help bring 7 additional beds to the shelter to help families and single women move from homelessness to permanent housing and prevent dozens of families from falling into homelessness.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Additional Homeless families and single women will be given a place to stay with supportive services, and through our comprehensive approach, they will be assisted in moving from homelessness to self-reliance. Most of our clients leave the shelter to move into permanent housing with increased income through assistance in achieving or upgrading employment or obtaining mainstream benefits. With the intensive support provided by our program and our collaborative partners, families and single women are prepared to enter and/or sustain permanent housing when they leave our housing program. Our Rental Assistance program will allow more LA County households who are at high risk of losing their housing due to temporary challenges to avoid homelessness and stay in their homes, while assisting them with case management and referrals to be able to sustain their housing beyond their exit from the program. Long term, funding will be leveraged to continue this expansion.",

Outcomes for clients (with recent results) include: 1) move into safe, stable and sustainable housing for at least 4 months after moving out of the shelter (95%); 2) successfully completing at least 75% of personal goals while in the shelter (80%); 3) saving at least $1,000 while in the shelter (57%). These goals are evaluated through review of case management documents, exit interviews and surveys taken at 1 and 4 months after families exit the program. We provided approximately 5,700 bed nights of housing over the last two years. Success for rental assistance is: 100% of those assisted will remain housed for another 30 days, and that an additional 85%+ of these families will retain their housing for at least 6 months following assistance. Over 90 LA families a year are served by our Family Stabilization Program."

    "organization": "501CTHREE",
    "summary": "We will test the drinking water in 5,000 homes in areas of South Central Los Angeles with aging infrastructure for toxins that can result in cognitive issues and other negative health outcomes. The tests will measure the water quality coming out of the kitchen tap in each home, and upload the results to a central database for analysis and reporting. Residents will be provided with the results, their level of risk, and those with a high risk will be connected to community organizations that can provide their families with clean drinking water.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "This project will improve long-term municipal service delivery and equitable investment in the built environment to ensure safe access to water. Comprehensive data collection will enable the development of more sophisticated water safety indicators, easier, quicker testing and access to information specific to the household level. This improved transparency will lead to clearer knowledge of where water quality issues exist and improved ability to predict incidents of water contamination. Engaging community organizations will facilitate targeted interventions, improved community health outcomes, greater trust in municipal water, enhanced ability for communities to self-advocate for more equitable water service for all residents. The immediate impact will activate a coalition of organizations with mutual interest in water safety, training of community members to more effectively engage others on water infrastructure and expanded dataset on water safety in at-risk communities.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 5,000",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Climate and Environment",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The project will test drinking water in 5000 homes in South-Central Los Angeles for high levels of lead, copper, and other contaminants. This information will assist residents in obtaining safe water, advocating for line replacement and filters. The project activities include: test plan development, training test administrators, at-home testing, survey of residents, data integration and reporting. The test plan will be developed with input from participating community organizations. The test plan will include the sampling method, survey design, and recruitment strategy. The study will employ a stratified sample strategy based on the year of housing construction to identify study participants recognizing that housing age is a significant predictor of lead levels. Study participants will have the option of completing a health questionnaire that includes indicators of lead contamination. Participants will be provided with test results for their residence and have the option to receive support from community organizations. Tests will be administered using optically-scanned water test strips. The test results will be uploaded to a database and used to produce maps indicating the presence and levels of contaminants. 501CTHREE will manage data integration and produce the final reports and dashboard. Individual test results will be provided to the residents, and residents will have the option to be contacted post-project for support.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We believe that water is a human right. Due to a history of disinvestment in municipal water infrastructure, residents of South Central Los Angeles face a risk of exposure to drinking water contaminated by lead and other toxins. Lead exposure can harm a child's health, damaging the brain and nervous system, causing learning, hearing, speech and behavioral problems. Lead piping was banned in 1986 yet lead remains a health hazard in communities across the country. The Los Angeles County water utility provides public water quality reports at the systems level. These reports do not account for differences between affluent communities and communities with concentrated poverty, where the water infrastructure has suffered from systemic disinvestment. Consequently, the 163,000 residents of South Central Los Angeles are largely unaware of the safety of the drinking water in their homes and the danger of exposure to lead and other toxins.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This is an extension of the Water Box program, which serves residents in Watts whose water is unsafe to drink. 501CTHREE has worked with community partners in Watts to test 800 homes to determine where targeted interventions are needed. This project will expand that effort to cover all of South Central Los Angeles. Success of previous efforts is evidenced by the demand for testing, water box programming and services by existing partnerships and their constituents."

To combat the challenges of the pandemic, RSG! and its roster of Olympians/Paralympians inspire and help students reintegrate movement and physical activity into their lives. Whether the athletes are interacting with students in-person or communicating virtually, they are motivated to demonstrate and teach students the importance and benefits of physical and mental health. The RSG! curriculum, can be easily implemented in-person and online. As mentioned above, the curriculum includes physical activities and SEL topics like emotional awareness, goal setting, and decision making which are even more important as students emerge from isolation. Finally, of the in-person schools that RSG! serves, 84% are Title 1 and are comprised of students who are disproportionality impacted by health, wellness, and academic challenges. With this grant, the additional in-person schools that RSG! plans to serve will be all Title 1.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The absence of arts education in California has been referred to as a “silent crisis.” Nearly 45 years after passing Prop 13, the state’s public school system is still reeling. The opportunity gap has worsened for districts primarily home to historically excluded families. The inequality is underscored with over 80% of schools in non-compliance with VAPA laws. In Los Angeles County only 40% of students are enrolled in at least one arts course and 39% of students are Math proficient. Now more than ever, students require a well-rounded approach to recover from the pandemic. Craig Williams educators have expressed that students are struggling to stay motivated, collaborate, and have low self-esteem. In 2021 Craig Williams students bucked below the County trend with only 34% hitting Math proficiency. Investing in a STEAM learning model that prioritizes creative problem solvers, we can cultivate a systems-level shift within a STEM workforce that is only 17% Black/Hispanic and 25% women.",

Dramatic Results has served Craig Williams’ 4th grade students since 2019. For the first time, the agency will increase our services to include all 5th grade students. Based on feedback from classroom teachers we will customize and deliver a series of paid arts integrated social-emotiol learning trainings. Craig Williams Elementary will serve as the physical site of programming, provide access to students, and knowledge of students’ strengths and areas of improvement. Together, we will help achieve the site’s Plan for Student Achievement to meet the needs of diverse learners by integrating ELA and Math with the development of 21st century skill building.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "To address the compounding issues listed in question six, Dramatic Results will deliver our legacy program, Math in a Basket to every 4th and 5th grade student (125 in total) at Craig Williams Elementary in 2022-2023. Craig Williams is a Title I school in the Bellflower USD (SPA 7) with less than 50% of students meeting Math and ELA proficiency. Math in a Basket is a hands-on, 12-week STEAM program that integrates art, making, and design with California content standards in Math and Social Studies. The program supports the reinforcement of math and social-emotional learning using lessons that apply math concepts through group commonalities, personal identity, and basketry. By using culturally-valued art forms, our team can make academic content more accessible to underserved students through arts integration and generating personally-meaningful pathways to STEM and creative fields. Students explore real world applications of math by weaving a functional reed basket, thereby strengthening skills in measurement, algebraic formulas, and geometry. Students learn to problem solve, communicate, and collaborate with their peers while being exposed to STEAM career pathways. Additionally, Dramatic Results’ curriculum team will provide Craig Williams’ teachers with training in arts integrated social emotional learning. Guided by the needs of the school, the training will expand our services and function as a professional development model for future work with the site.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "By serving 125 Craig Williams students with our Math in a Basket program, it would allow Dramatic Results to iterate and update a foundational, but recently shelved body of curriculum. Since 2002, the agency has received three consecutive multi-year grants from the U.S. Department of Education for Math in a Basket, yet in recent years the program has been delivered infrequently. This short-term goal has a positive impact on our agency’s reach and the students at Craig Williams. Dramatic Results is strengthening our partnership with the site by providing teachers with a series of paid trainings that illustrate the potential an interwoven arts strategy has on all aspects of teaching and learning. This level of collaboration will have a long term impact on staff, as well as future generations of students. Together, we will maximize resources to meet the needs of diverse learners. By investing in arts-integrated educational pathways we can cultivate a more creative and diverse workforce."

Residents want Compton to be a thriving place for people to grow up and grow older. However, the City of Compton still has less greenspace than more affluent communities in Los Angeles County. Built in 2013 with input from multi-sector partners to solve this problem, CCNP makes Compton a more livable community for all, because there is a clean, secure park with amenities within walking distance. The LA Conservation Corps has worked with local government, particularly Compton Unified School District and our neighbor Washington Elementary. The park is an important natural resource for our community. It provides green space for the recreation of the students at adjacent Washington Elementary, who otherwise have only asphalt to play on, and the community. It contributes to the urban tree canopy and collects rainwater. It is an oasis in the community.",

This grant would enable us to work toward our next objective—to provide access to the park, as well as activities, on Saturdays and Sundays to whole families and working adults. We can host older residents by working with community groups and elected officials to reach out to them through the channels they respond to. Our park is already intended to be inviting to older residents through accommodating design, accessibility, and security.",

CCNP is a privately funded park. The LA Conservation Corps, a nonprofit environmentally focused youth development organization, offer young adults paid job training in managing the park and taking on other climate projects in the surrounding community. Not only are we providing park access and green space, but also jobs and career development to young adults ages 18-26 from the community. This park is entirely privately funded, no government funding for the daily maintenance and operations. Expanded weekend hours would provide more hours of paid work experience and on-the-job training for Corpsmembers. Corpsmembers' goals are to point their lives in a positive direction and connect with college and careers. Corpsmembers working at Compton Creek Natural Park are supervised by and receive training from crew supervisors in landscaping, amenities and facilities maintenance, public safety, facilitating programming, and communicating with park users. we can bring in the people through events to increase their engagement with this resource built for their benefit. Expanding weekend hours increases community access, and offering free activities promotes park usage. Offering environmental education programs for visitors promotes understanding of the community’s coexistence with the Compton Creek subwatershed."

    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Students in foster care face unique challenges that can disrupt their learning and throw them off-track from being college- and career-ready. For example, the trauma they have experienced can make it difficult to focus in class. Students in foster care often experience multiple changes in where they live and with whom, which translates to high rates of school mobility compared to other students. Court hearings, family visits, and disproportionate school discipline cause them to miss significant class time. As a result, students in foster care in LA County are more likely to perform below grade level in comparison to other students; have the highest rates of chronic absenteeism (31%) and high school dropout (28%) compared to other high-needs student groups; and are far less likely to earn a high school diploma in four years (52%) than students overall (82%). While 93% of youth in foster care say they want to go to college, only 8% obtain an associate’s or bachelor’s degree by age 26.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Holding local educational agencies (LEAs), such as school districts and county offices of education, accountable for the support they provide to students in foster care to overcome the barriers they face is one critical way to improve students’ educational outcomes. Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs) hold untapped potential to ensure LEAs provide targeted supports and services to students in foster care. Specifically, LEAs must submit LCAPs to the State annually to describe their plans to support positive student outcomes and, as of 2019, LEAs are “encouraged” to include a description of the targeted services and supports they will provide to their students in foster care. However, per Children Now’s analysis of a sample of 2021-22 LCAPs (including those submitted by LA County LEAs), only 33% of LCAPs included any services or supports that were targeted to meet the educational needs of youth in foster care. The poor educational outcomes of students in foster care indicate a lack of access to targeted supports, but this issue cannot be sufficiently addressed without a better understanding of the gaps. With support from LA 2050, Children Now will provide technical assistance to school districts in LA County and the LA County Office of Education (LACOE) to ensure they provide and describe in their 2022-23 LCAPs the support they will provide to students in foster care.

Their poor academic outcomes, including low high school and college graduation rates, impact their prospects for employment that pay a living wage. Sadly, it is unclear what supports and services are provided by LEAs to this group of some of our highest-needs students in order to help them overcome the barriers they face.

For this project, we will measure our success by the following metrics: • 81 LEAs in LA County will be pushed to include and highlight in their 2022-23 LCAPs the targeted supports and services they will provide to their students in foster care. • 81 LEAs in LA County will be offered technical assistance to complete their 2022-23 LCAPs. To further evaluate this project, we will analyze a sample of 2022-23 LA County LCAPs to determine the services and supports to be provided to high-needs students and gaps to be addressed. This project is a critical first step to improving the educational outcomes for the 10,000+ students in foster care in LA County.",

In 2021, the University of Southern California, Annenberg found that 43.8% of established artists were non-white, and only 7.5% of major label music executives came from ethnic backgrounds. In the top nine firms, every chief executive was white, while only one was female. This needs to change. In addition, the 2020 U.S Music Industries: Jobs & Benefits Report for the RIAA states that total employment increased 18%, while total receipts grew 14.6% to $113.2B. While every metric grew within the range, the only exception in the data set that experienced zero growth was earnings per employee with an annual rate of -0.6%.

This will minimize financial disparities within the music industry and provide communities with industry-level practices that current record labels forgo. With aid from LA2050 our aim to accommodate underrepresented voices accompanied by the growth of this safe space and access to our ethnically diverse network of music professionals, can make real, sustainable changes in the industry by focusing on art collectively. Daily operations for our initiative will consist of audio production sessions, artist and repertoire services, singer and songwriting workshops, and informational discourse through social mixers and community engagement. We strive to aid creatives within our local communities in the pursuit of their creative goals and to become a leading, values-driven company in the recording industry that our communities can reliably trust.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Following the success of the SCLASS initiative, Los Angeles will be home to a more diverse group of music administrators, executives and artists who will engender and reshape a new standard of transparency and accessibility in the music industry. With the sustainability of our programs and workshops, historically marginalized groups will be able to experience and participate in a genuine evolution of the arts. Artists and employees affected by our initiative will be better able to live and create freely, where conviction is the main determiner of success. On a broader scale, starting with the proper representation of latinx, black, brown, and asian communities, we envision the underrepresented recording industry personnel living in Los Angeles free from wage-theft, receiving the same opportunity that privileged and predominantly white-male major label employees have received for decades.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "To SCLASS, success means the well-being of employees, artists, and increased representation by dissolving the concept of the starving artist. This begins with the training of eight new members and launching interactive community engagement campaigns. As artists continue to collaborate with SCLASS, we help them develop goals and measure progress, with one of these indicators being listener engagement within digital service providers. During our valued time working with Juice Wrld and Grade A Records, we created projects that reached approximately 30,000,000 monthly listeners, over 3,000,000 with Pierre Bourne, and 16,000,000 with Summer Walker, respectively. We feel very capable in our ability to help marginalized communities succeed forthright. In the long-term we plan to increase the percentage of non-white established artists to 53.8%, women songwriters up from 12.7% to 25%, as well as pushing for at least 30% of music executives to come from ethnic minority backgrounds.",

As this program continues from K thru 2nd grade, we expect to see a reduction in school based accidents including bullying. Outside of school, kids will avoid scenarios that could result in serious injury. The increased skills kids acquire will allow them to make smarter every day decisions, thus reducing accidents to and from school and in the community. This gives children a sense of security and a sense of safety. Similarly, developing an early mindset for kindness, enhances empathy and other important social emotional skills, will result in an improved school culture. Also, there will be increased academic focus due to fewer distractions, and reduced behavioral incidents. A measurable outcome is fewer attendance issues because children want to be in school.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Every day, across the US, thousands of children suffer from an increasing number of acts of violence, bullying and injuries in their community. Children often end up in emergency hospitals, as a result of their action/decision that could have been prevented if they had the proper knowledge. Keeping children safe every day is the greatest concern of parents, schools and community. Each year: 12,000 children and young adults die from unintentional injuries (Stanford Health). 254,000 children (under 18) are injured in the community. 2,000+ children ages 14 and under die as a result of a home injury and many more are injured. 1 of 5 students report being bullied. Our goal is to enable better decision making by our youngest, most vulnerable children and thereby reduce incidents and prevent serious injuries. Our program is unique as it addresses a range of safety issues for children as young as 4 years of age and provides knowledge and appropriate responses to threatening situations.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Basic Situational & Sensory Awareness Safety Skills are the foundation of the program. The program includes Rocket animated videos, Rocket’s Sense of Safety & Beyond! Activity Books, 15 activities and standards based lesson plans for teachers and scripts. For teachers, it’s easy to administer, and insert during the day, as each lesson is approx. 20 min. For special events Rocket will visit the classroom for an interactive zoom call. By using their senses, including their intuitive 6th sense (that feeling that something is not quite right), children become more aware of the world around them and what to do in various relevant everyday situations to avoid serious injuries. Students develop a mindset for safety, building a schema for how to respond and plan for different scenarios resulting in a quick response to possible dangerous situations. The program builds in knowledge so that it becomes embedded in the minds of students. Rocket’s Safety Certificates for each subject are awarded to students. Activities, Lessons and certificates go home encouraging parents and guardians to be involved and communicate with their child about everyday safety. Social emotional topics: making friends, saying kind things, asking for help also bring an important healthy dimension to student behavior and supports a positive school culture. The program empowers children with critical life long skills and the confidence they need to make smart decisions that can avoid serious injuries."

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "By attaining work permits for immigrants with pending visa applications, this project will improve the quality of life for local immigrants in numerous ways. Clients who receive work authorization will benefit financially when they obtain gainful employment, and will be better able to support themselves and their families. Legal work permits will empower immigrants to demand safe, humane working conditions, fair compensation for their work, and freedom from labor exploitation based on their immigration status. Employment is also a key social determinant of health, and can positively influence workers' self-esteem, social connections, and engagement within their community. These benefits will promote successful integration of immigrant populations throughout Los Angeles.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Throughout LA, there is a persistent need for immigration assistance among survivors of abuse, crime, and neglect. ICWC has provided such assistance since 2004, and is a national expert on two humanitarian-based visa categories: U visas and Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). While U visas apply to those who are survivors of violent crime, SIJS applicants are abandoned, abused, or neglected undocumented youth. Unfortunately, it can take over 5 years for these visas to be approved. While applications are pending, clients are unable to work legally. This poses a substantial barrier to clients' financial, social, and emotional well-being. Recent policy changes, however, have opened up the possibility for these clients to obtain work permits. As of June 2021 for U visas and May 2022 for SIJS, petitioners of these visas may apply for work permits while their applications are pending. As a result, ICWC has the opportunity to greatly increase access to jobs among immigrants in LA.",

Current data suggest a strong need for this program. In the past 12 months, ICWC has handled thousands of applications for work authorization for U visa petitioners. In addition, ICWC currently has 60 SIJS clients who are newly eligible to apply for work authorization. When clients return to our agency to apply for green cards, our staff document several pieces of information that suggest a positive impact on quality of life after receiving work authorization. Clients report increased incomes, safer and more stable sources of work, as well as contributions to retirement plans and social security. Beyond this, we have seen numerous times that legal work permits allow clients to live freer, safer, and more open lives.",

In total, we expect to assist over 500 clients who are eligible for these work permits over a one-year period. Because of the recent policy changes mentioned in Question 6, ICWC is now able to apply for work permits for 60 LA-based clients with Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. In addition, ICWC intends to assist an estimated 450 U visa clients throughout the grant period. (*This estimate is based on the number of work authorizations for U visa clients handled by ICWC's LA office in the past 12 months.) The legal staff at ICWC file for work permits by first requesting an Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765) and then submitting an Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766) to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Employment Authorization applications are submitted on a rolling basis depending on the status of each client. In addition to the legal and administrative work required to obtain work permits, ICWC will run workshops and engage in outreach to inform immigrants of their eligibility for work authorization, as well as any rights and responsibilities that a work permit entails. Please see Question 11 for a more detailed description of the work permit application process."

To ensure that PTV clients have a safety net, we provide them with emergency support. Expressive Healing Arts—Creative arts experiences transcend language barriers and are powerful tools to confront and heal from long-term emotional trauma. Arts programming allows refugees to release trauma stored in their bodies, muscle memory, and the limbic system of the brain and work through complex feelings and multiple layers of cultural and other barriers to mental health and empowerment. Training/Education—PTV provides training and education in areas that promote independence, inclusion, and social/economic mobility (e.g., vocational/job training, assistance with learning and conversing in English, civics education, and improving financial literacy). Legal Advocacy—PTV provides legal advocacy and works with an extensive network of legal service organizations and attorneys to ensure high-quality representation for our clients.

These refugees need much more than legal support if they are to heal and have opportunities to contribute as engaged members of their new communities. With founders who themselves were victims of persecution and through serving torture victims over four decades, PTV has developed a deep understanding of the needs of asylum seekers and the challenges they face in resettling in the U.S. PTV’s staff and Board of Directors are knowledgeable and equipped to help asylees overcome the many obstacles they face to become productive and healthy members of society.",

Since 2002, the SMC workshops have been offered as extra credit by over 60 professors/year and enroll approximately 500 students/year. They create an all-encompassing understanding of environmental issues, actions, and career opportunities in sustainability fields. Guided by a Workshop Leader, topics are explored through group discussions, interactive activities, presentations, and field trips. The peer-to-peer format utilizes “social diffusion”. Research shows that social diffusion speeds up the process of adopting new behaviors when information comes through conversations with people we trust or people we perceive to be similar to ourselves. Students participate in 3-hour community service projects. Top performing students can participate as workshop leaders & are trained to guide the next round of workshops. This is a unique opportunity for students to help educate their peers while enhancing their own leadership, public speaking, and organizational skills. “Had I not taken this program I would not have been aware of all of the resources that LA county has for people and businesses interested in becoming more sustainable.” -SMC Student ‘21",

For positive environmental change, people need to act. Most people want to get involved, but don’t know where to start. Sustainable Works addresses this by educating on specific issues and giving program participants concrete actions they can take. In the report \"Mainstreaming low-carbon lifestyles\" from the organization Climate Outreach, it was concluded that behavior change campaigns must build confidence and self-efficacy in the participant’s ability to act. To build the confidence in student participants, Sustainable Works offers a peer-to-peer approach that focuses on individual action.",

By the close of the Workshops, students report, on average, an improvement of 22% in their belief of ease of implementation of sustainable practices and we see on average that students reach a 99% consensus that they understand what behaviors and habits support sustainable living. In conjunction with SMC, a study on the past 5 years (Fall ‘15-Spring ‘20) of students who have attended the Workshops was conducted. The analysis showed that students who attended the Workshops had a higher course success rate when compared to non-participating students. For Black and Latinx students there was a higher percentage gain in course success rate by participating in workshops, 55% and 50% respectively.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In the short term, our goal is to reach more LA County college students to create the adoption of sustainable behaviors. Through learned sustainable actions, Sustainable Works is creating a more informed public that is empowered to act. The education that Workshop participants receive does not end when the Workshops end, rather a chain of sustainable practices is created as they share their knowledge within their communities. We strive to learn from students and their communities, which helps to inform future Workshops that in turn leads to a more effective program. In the long-term our goal is to expand our program model to more educational institutions throughout LA County in order to make sustainable practices the norm. “I was able to gather so much significant information on how to incorporate sustainable practices in my daily life, and advocate for them.

Awareness of this issue is high, yet action is low - we’ve yet to see sustainable, incremental change that moves the needle for women. Through this program, our mission is to strategically uplift 15 promising creators with the goal of ending the long-established pattern in the next generation. Added to the uphill battle women and gender expansive students face in getting hired within a competitive industry, they struggle amidst a student loan crisis and rising inflation.

These statistics reinforce a lack of equity in resources made available for incarcerated and returned citizens. There is little access to creative tools to navigate the challenges of incarceration. This empowers Creative Acts to do the work to initiate reform in the justice system. We use art as a tool to combat inequities, reduce recidivism, and keep families connected. Layered into the racial disparity of incarcerated people is a lack of racial diversity within leading organizations. We aim to disrupt leadership bureaucracies of the nonprofit system.

Sometimes this shapes itself as integrating their stories into heartfelt lyrics of a hip-hop song in our partnership with justice nonprofit, Emergent Works and other times it looks like creating poetry with youth activists in our collaboration with youth anti-gun violence organization, March For Our Lives. Through these exercises, youth have the opportunity to unpack and heal the trauma associated with their incarcerated experience. This dynamic program is growing, we are currently in 100% of youth probation centers in LA County and we hope to expand our reach and ultimately our impact. We want to offer this program more frequently throughout the year, so that more incarcerated youth have a consistent artistic outlet that also encourages learning more about ways to be civically engaged.

A newer vision is to incorporate Virtual Reality to expose youth to technologies and social experiences that will hopefully support reducing the rate of reoffending within our participants. We can push this vision for success through the program’s circular impact.

In addition to needing more Black healthcare professionals, it is important for potential patients and clients to quickly find already practicing professional. Moreover, our industrial approach to healthcare exploits our bodies and trivializes wellness. Black Body Well Space will serve the primary purpose of building a database for individuals to quickly identify Black primary care physicians and wellness practitioners (physical therapists, occupational therapists, yoga instructors, personal trainers, pilates instructors etc). Taking a holistic approach to health and wellness, the initial practitioner focus is on primary care physicians, as they are often gatekeepers to other specialists and providers of preventative services and wellness modalities. The site will allow Angelenos, and gradually others, to identify culturally competent professionals to help on their path to wellness. After search on the site individuals may contact providers directly and offer feedback on the site about services. Black health is tied to Black community, BBWS will host pointed virtual and in-person wellness events. These events will center around physical wellbeing concerns that are specific to Black individuals in Los Angeles. These events will help strengthen the sites network of professionals in the community while equipping residents with tools to advocate for themselves and their families.",

I’ve worked institutions of varying sizes and weight. In all settings my Black students made a point to seek me out as a resource and inquire about other professionals Looking at personal experience, I’ve been misdiagnosed or ill-treated due to racial bias. For most of 2017, I suffered from debilitating migraines. I met with several doctors and still suffered. By chance, I discovered a Black physician at an urgent care center. He questioned why I hadn’t been given medication to acutely alleviate pain? And we developed a proper plan of action. In sharing this experience many friends and colleagues commiserated.Beliefs about race often lead to inadequate treatment recommendations for black patients’ pain (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/).” I’m aware of these deterrents health.

When successful, Black Los Angelenos will have a go-to place to access wellness resources. Success will be seen in the time saved hunting culturally empathic providers, which can be measured anecdotally and through survey. There will be an increase in once weary residents seeking wellness advice and direction with the barrier of finding Black providers removed.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We will train at least 25 high school students and 15 educators in low income schools in Los Angeles County. Students will organize at least 25 registration drives, resulting in over 2,500 youth registering to vote from some of LA’s highest needs communities. In the 308 public high schools in LA County, approximately 70% of students qualify for the Free and Reduced Priced Meals (FRPM). Using this data point as a benchmark for socioeconomic status, the YDL-LA program will engage students in schools where at least 70% of students qualify for the RFMP. Our work with these teens will uplift LA County by increasing youth enfranchisement, fostering student leadership and activism in under-resourced high schools, and creating the community leaders of tomorrow. We believe that changing the culture of youth voting will result in systemic change. Our main aim in the long run is not just the number of registrations, but to foster civic leadership to last a lifetime.",

We measure the number of young leaders we train, the number of drives they lead, and the number of students registered to vote through their efforts. We also measure changes in county-wide pre registration rates through reports generated by the California Secretary of State, and we measure overall registration rates and turnout rates among young voters with the aid of the LA County voter file. While this is the first time we’ve focused our work to improve civic participation in low resourced schools, we know our approach works. In the past three years, virtually all of YDL student leaders we train go on to hold voter registration drives, and nationwide, students who have gone through our Future Voters Action Week, High School Voter Registration Week, and online workshops have organized hundreds of student-led drives in 35 states and more than 10,000 young people registering to vote.",

Through our program, students will learn life-long leadership skills, meet elected officials, gain practical experience in civic organizing, and collaborate on tactics for making change. The program incorporates community-building exercises in which each student develops a “public narrative,” a practice of storytelling that connects their personal experiences to larger public issues facing their communities. YDL students participate in training modules covering the foundations of youth voter engagement and organizing voter registration efforts in their own high schools. Student-led projects then provide these young people with opportunities to use their training to overcome real world challenges to youth voter participation in their own communities, culminating with each student holding a voter registration drive in their own school. Engaged educators will be provided with training and supplies to ensure that the student leaders receive mentorship and support throughout the process, while also ensuring a sustainable framework for civic engagement remains well beyond this grant.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In The Civics Center’s landmark 2021 report, “Future Voters and Gaps in Our Democracy”, we examined how successful Los Angeles Country school districts are in getting young people involved in the electoral process. A key feature was assessing the correlation between poverty rates and registration rates in LA County schools. What we found was striking: while poverty rates correlated with lower turnout among 18-year-olds, voter registration rates showed a much stronger connection to turnout than did poverty rates. At the same time, districts with meaningful efforts to promote voter registration and voting were able to achieve positive impacts including in low-income districts. The lack of consistent funding for civics education programs in low resource schools is disenfranchising the most vulnerable youth, denying them their most fundamental rights as Americans: to engage in our electoral system and advocate for their communities."

The vast majority of the participants earn less than $25 000 a year and often don't have a checking account. Participants learn about money habits, how to increase income, maximize savings and when and how to use credit. The aim of this training is to make them aware of how to make smarter financial decisions for themselves and their families, avoid debt, manage their spending and build a long-term financial stability, which they often did not experience while growing up. Upon successful completion of the training, participants are offered a year-long mentorship program, when a mentor is matched with a mentee in order to offer them support and advice in how to manage their money, no matter their budget.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Research and available data show that young adults who leave foster care face enormous challenges in everyday life and have a much higher likelihood (over 50%) of becoming imprisoned or homeless. Moreover, women face additional challenges, such as gender bias, in becoming financially independent. Historically, there has been a significant gap in female leadership role models, whether it is in business or politics. Studies and evidence however show us that female presence in leading positions is crucial to the success of the institutions they lead. The pay gap is another major problem for women, who earn on average 80% of what men earn for the same work and women of color earning as little as 60% of that. Studies show that women disproportionately need to overcome financial trauma which they experience at rates much higher than men. Women who grow up in foster care and underserved communities are particularly vulnerable and need support."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "As Southern Californians begin to opt for more drought-resilient, climate-friendly landscapes, the need for a knowledgeable landscaper workforce is greater than ever. However, many professionals in the industry do not yet possess the specialized knowledge to plant and care for native plants and California friendly gardens. Environmentally friendly gardens will not be adopted by the public until Los Angeles has a body of professionals who are adequately equipped to manage them and keep them looking beautiful. Our ten-part curriculum addresses key components of sustainability and gives landscape practitioners the tools and information they need to successfully maintain water-conserving gardens. This hones in on the potential that residential and commercial landscapes in Los Angeles have to save water, restore habitat and create resilience in the face of a growing population and an uncertain climate future.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "With the generous support of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) Community Partnerships program, and in partnership with CNPS and the US Green Building Council, LA we officially launched the CNPLC in the summer of 2020. During the one year pilot phase, the course was offered in Spanish and English, with priority given to sole proprietor businesses. To date, over 400 landscape professionals have completed the certification program. Interest in the program shows no signs of stopping; over the next twelve months, we expect another 200 individuals will complete this program. As the demand for this program grows, so do our needs for staffing and infrastructure to complete more trainings and support program alumni. See education.theodorepayne.org for more information."

The majority of our mentees attend Los Angeles Unified School District schools, where students are suffering “alarming academic harm” related to staffing shortages, shifts between online and in-person learning, and other factors related to COVID-19. In addition, the student-to-counselor ratio in California of 572:1 is one of the worst in the country. Teens often lack access to individualized mentoring and coaching at a critical juncture in their lives. From deciding on a career path to graduating from college, a lack of mentorship can result in the interruption of their career goals. In fact, our teens have shared how often they’ve been discouraged from applying to college or pursuing their career goals. Many times, WriteGirl mentors are their first experience working with creative professionals.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "WriteGirl has developed a layered approach for ushering teens into creative careers by providing a comprehensive program of mentoring, writing workshops, college guidance, publication and performance opportunities, leadership development, internships and specialized workshops in financial literacy, productivity tools, publishing and public speaking, all at no cost to youth. Overall, WriteGirl serves 500 youth annually throughout LA County and trains more than 400 professional writer volunteers annually to mentor teens. WriteGirl offers in-depth college entrance guidance to WriteGirl teens, and provides ongoing support, mentoring and resources to program alumnae, ages 18-24, to help them graduate from college and enter the workforce. WriteGirl also provides creative writing workshops at LA County alternative schools, juvenile detention facilities and community centers for co-ed teens and is a founding member of the Arts for Healing and Justice Network. WriteGirl currently supports 150 mentee-mentor pairs, offering teens the chance to work in one-on-one writing sessions with professional writers. Jamilah Mena, a WriteGirl alum, shared: “I was raised in South Central LA by two hard-working Garifuna-Honduran parents who preached the importance of education to progress in life. WriteGirl afforded me the opportunity to build technical skills as a writer and provided a safe environment so I could develop confidence in myself as a Woman of Color with a lot to offer the world.”",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Teens in Los Angeles County are a vital resource as future leaders, producers, writers, artists, teachers and more. We see the powerful impact some of our teens have already had in the region (Amanda Gorman, several Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureates – all WriteGirl alums). When teens find careers they love, we’ve seen firsthand how they have inspired their family and community to pursue their own academic and creative goals. Companies and organizations across LA County benefit greatly from direct connections with their communities and we continue to connect our teens and volunteers with internships, panels, specialized workshops and behind-the-scenes conversations with entities such as Lionsgate, NBCUniversal, NBC4, Los Angeles Times, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Disney and Warner Bros.

Within the next 20 years, 47% of all jobs are likely to be eliminated by technology. Sixty-five percent of children entering school now will work in a job that does not currently exist. Entrepreneurship education prepares youth for an uncertain future.

Water shortages, heat islands, and weather extremes will get worse. For our health we need to increase our green spaces and use them for exercise, cooling, and community. But they are suffering, and past practices need to be changed: -Our non-native street trees use six times more water than native species. -70% of residential water use in Los Angeles irrigates (primarily non-native) landscaping. The fertilizers used for non-native plants are a big source of runoff pollution in LA's urban watersheds and Santa Monica Bay. -The LA region consumed 25% more water in April 2022 than April 2020. -Leaf blowers and lawn mowers cause air and noise pollution. -LA has lost over 90% of local butterflies and songbirds since ~1900 due to replacing native habitat with non-natives. There is little awareness of the impact our \"usual\" practices have on our water supply and our health, or that we can change.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "As native plants replace non-native landscaping in residential yards and on public parcels, LA County would transition from urban hardscape to cities with vibrant patchworks of sustainable green spaces, which could survive our hotter and drier future. METRO would expand their use of native landscaping and model best maintenance practices. Anyone near a station could see what is possible and learn from what we have done. Water usage would be reduced while native birds, insects, and other animals would flourish and fewer pollutants would enter our ecosystem. Greenways would provide health and community benefits, and students of all ages could enjoy and learn from nature near them. Landscapers would practice maintenance and irrigation methods appropriate to the plants, and a beautiful yard would be a sustainable one filled with biodiversity.

Success of Part 2, the Coordinator, will be an evaluation of the planning and execution (including number and size) of community events, work parties, school visits, and workforce seminars. Records of outreach (numbers and populations reached), presentations, hands-on activities, and research reports will be maintained. One measure of overall success would be to obtain a commitment from the METRO Board to use sustainable maintenance practices, and direction to their contractors to ensure that. A second would be an increase in the number of local residents removing turf and installing native plants and mulch. A third would be outreach efforts leading to new Greenways being proposed in other parts of the City.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Westwood Greenway's vegetated creek treats urban runoff. The upland is landscaped with natives (adapted to dry hot summers and short winters), that add beauty and biodiversity to the city. The Greenway shows that we can reduce water usage and water pollution while increasing biodiversity, tree cover, and green spaces which cool LA. To multiply the effect, we want to: 1. Change what is seen as a beautiful yard: it is a sustainable palette of natives supporting wildlife, and a ground cover of leaf litter and mulch that feeds the soil. 2. Model changed maintenance practices and eliminate fertilizers and poisons. 3. Show our neighbors, elected's, and professional landscapers what this new landscape can look like and how to create it. Expose children to nature and science. The Greenway is a living lab. Located next to a Metro station, it is accessible from across the County. Part 1 of our initiative is a 350-400 sq.ft. mural visible from the station platform. The artist would collaborate with experts to design the mural with life-size wildlife and plants, highlighted with clusters of text on key points. School field trips, tour groups, neighbors, and workforce trainees would see it as well. Part 2 is to hire a part-time coordinator to plan community events, conduct outreach, and collaborate with maintenance professionals. The Theodore Payne Foundation, TreePeople, Natural History Museum, Surfrider, UCLA, and others will be invited to continue their involvement."

While our BIPOC population continues to grow steadily, only minimal increases have occurred in the percentage of BIPOC psychologists. In the last two decades, the percentage of Black Americans increased from 12% to 12.4% while the percentage of Black psychologists increased from a measly 2% to 3%. During this same time, the percentage of Hispanic psychologists increased 2% (from 5% to 7%), while the Hispanic American population increased from 12.5% to 18.7%. There are critical social implications from this lack of racial and cultural diversity within the field of psychology. Language and cultural barriers between client & therapist discourage BIPOC individuals from seeking help. BIPOC individuals with mental health disorders are three times less likely than white Americans to seek mental health treatment. This has detrimental effects on individuals, their families, and their communities.",

We will provide support services, resources, connections, and inspiration to increase the number of BIPOC psychologists. These individuals will advance in their careers and improve their incomes. These new BIPOC psychologists will help reduce the stigma against and increase accessibility of mental health services within their communities. These new psychologists will provide mental health services and help individuals, families, and their communities to thrive.

Initiative consists of four pathways: (1) provide support services (including support groups, 1:1 mentorship, and test preparation for the psychologist licensing exam) to psychologists in the early stages of their psychology training and careers. (2) provide micro-grants to up-and-coming psychologists of color through a dedicated grant pool; (3) enhance and expand our POC Job Board to connect exponentially more psychologists of color with psychology training and employment opportunities; and (4) increase awareness of opportunities for people of color in the psychology field through webinars, podcasts, social media, and our YouTube channel. The initiative will also enable us to build connections and relationships with academic institutions and professional organizations that will allow us to identify, locate, and reach up-and-coming psychologists of color who could benefit from these four pathways."

This is accomplished through an innovative human empowerment framework for direct services that is culturally relevant, goal oriented, and trauma informed. Working adults are screened using ERt’s cutting edge PPH (predicting persistent homelessness) tools. Cohort members are provided with housing and other necessities as well as academic, personal and behavioral health support. Project participants engage a nine-month colloquium that engenders success in diverse career settings. The sessions focus on achieving housing and employment outcomes, as well as scholastic achievement, financial literacy, and physical and emotional healing. Key demographic and experiential data are collected during and after the intervention to inform ERt’s ongoing research on solutions to homelessness in Los Angeles County and beyond. After the intervention, 83% of participants got job offers paying $20+/hour, and 3 in 4 accepted jobs and promotions. All reported increased career readiness, as well as improvements in other quality of life measures. Over 90% solved acute issues of housing insecurity. This pilot is proving to be the best way to address homelessness because empowering people to afford housing is a more sustainable solution than providing permanent supportive housing.",

The control group is being identified by creating propensity score matches based on screening probabilities for persistent homelessness. The Realization Project is demonstrating success through four key measures: 1.\tImprovements in personal well-being 2.\tObtaining and keeping living wage jobs 3.\tObtaining and keeping housing 4.\tReductions in public costs that offset program costs"

Our housing is just not a place to live or an address for those coming from jails, prisons, hospitals, the streets, or treatment centers. We strive to make our homes as beautiful and comfortable as possible. We want our clients to be proud of where they live and respect the house they live in. Our family-like model of living helps the men learn the necessary basics for the next step in their life whether it is to obtain employment, benefits or another type of help. Often, if one guy is going to school or has a job, others will follow their examples. Shared living teaches them to become more responsible in the basics of keeping the house.

After carefully evaluating the submission and funding request within 60 days, VISF works with these individuals to provide a grant that directly addresses the inequality present. There is no inequality too small. Examples of inequities include a need for new equipment, registration fees, facility rentals, unfair practice times compared to male counterparts, and more. We want to support and enable girls across every community. Upon Microgrant allocation, VISF also trains recipients in Title IX so that they can continue to lead and advocate in their communities. VISF administers a pre-analysis on measurable items regarding fund usage, Title IX inequalities, sport environment, etc. to Microgrant recipient(s) before working with recipient(s) to finalize payment, whether monetary or providing materials support (e.g. new jerseys).

VISF will track allocation of funds in determining impact. Prior to funding, we will work closely with accepted grant recipients to outline expected impact and later compare it to actual reach and objectives met. This also instills an internal feedback loop for VISF on ways to improve the Microgrant process and maximize long-term impact amongst communities.

However, it has been found that boys still get 1.13 million more sport opportunities than girls despite changes in legislation and funding allocation (National Federation of State High School Associations, 2018-2019). Additionally, 42% of families state cost as the leading reason their child cannot participate in sports (Whitaker, et al., 2019). Through the VISF x Los Angeles Microgrant Program, we can bridge the inequality gaps present in youth girls’ sports. We train girls in Title IX and educate them on identifying inequalities in their communities. Without VISF in the community, girls may not know where to go and how to find help when they face barriers to sport."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "ETM-LA began in 2006 with 2 partner schools, teaching 800 students. In our 16th year, we have grown to 42 partner schools, reaching 18,500 students across LA County. ETM-LA customizes its sequential, comprehensive program for schools, making it unique to the community and its specific needs. We ensure our program is top-notch and innovative by employing dedicated teachers that use music to nurture character development, self-esteem, and social skills. Music classes align with state/national core standards and are taught by trained teachers who implement a culturally responsive approach with a focus on social-emotional learning. We listen and respond to our partners so that our program evolves in real time to meet our schools’ needs. This includes STEAM-focused lessons, multimedia music, music technology, and a deeper focus on special needs, music therapy, and healing-centered practices. By working with school district leaders, we foster a culture of support within the school community to ensure the long-term sustainability of the program. We do so by providing professional development for school teachers to support the integration of music with the core curriculum, guidance for principals, and parent workshops to share the importance and benefits of music education. We have successfully advocated for the increase of full-time music teachers in school districts as showcased through past partner schools graduating from our model and hiring our music teachers.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "While CA once led the nation in arts education, Prop. 13 (1978) resulted in deep cuts in school music programs. The deterioration has been particularly jarring in LA, where 80% of elementary schools do not have the programs needed to meet state arts requirements (LA Times, 2015). “And now that [music is] gone, many administrators don’t know how to get it back,” says Patricia Wayne, former Prog. Dir., Create CA. Students enrolled in school arts programs have higher attendance and reading levels, fewer discipline problems, higher graduation rates, and stronger social-emotional skills. Yet, music education is unevenly provided across LA and oftentimes fragmented in approach. Because some children in public schools are getting high-quality arts education and others are not, “It’s no longer just a school issue, it’s a moral issue. There’s a huge equity gap.” (Laura Smyth, CA Alliance for Arts Ed)",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our vision of success begins at the ground level as evidenced through student/teacher/parent surveys, student journals, performance attendance, and school attendance rates. Measures of success include: • Increased student performance in and attitudes toward both the arts and school. • The ability of music teachers and academic teachers to integrate music with other subjects. • Broadened and deepened school/community understanding of and support for arts education. • School efforts toward sustaining programs independently. For our students – the majority of whom are at-risk – the benefits of music education are critical and life-changing. We are witness to the communal and holistic development in our students and partner school communities. Providing equity, access, and inclusion are vital to ensuring that children have a healthy, bright future so that they – our future leaders – can make Los Angeles the best place to create, play, connect, live, and learn in 2050.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "A recent external evaluation by Evaluation Specialists looked at ETM-LA’s school-wide approach to providing yearlong, sequential music education. Focusing on outcomes related to socio-emotional wellness and attitudes about learning music, the evaluation reported key findings such as: · 95% of ETM-LA partner school teachers believe music education should be offered as part of the core curriculum. · 92% of ETM-LA partner school teachers said their students were engaged in learning – a 40% increase in partner school teachers observing student engagement, compared to only 7% in control schools receiving intermittent or no music. 7th Grader Isaac, who struggled with expressing his feelings, shared, “I would be emotional and sometimes take [my anger] out on the wrong people. But when I’m doing music it calms me down.” Isaac found joy and motivation through music, confiding, “It’s made my anxiety better, because school’s kind of stressful. I had like 4 F’s…[now they’re] straight A’s.”",

Covid only accentuated the focus on the different set of values prevalent in this demographic. The standard progress of higher education after high school is not always possible or desired. There is a lot of re thinking and re-imagining of how business and spaces will be utilized in the future. There is a focus on entrepreneurship and the network of support necessary for these efforts to be successful. Secondly there is hesitancy or resistance in requiring a long term lease in order to implement their initiatives. Landlords are still reluctant to adjust to the new economic progress and do not offer shorter, more cost effective alternatives. Young business owners are not always ready to make a long term commitment to an untested idea and recent, rapid, rise in rental costs is a barrier.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "As a community resource center, we also serve as a platform for the implementation of new ideas and initiatives. We have sponsored over 30 pop up markets over the last 18 months. Our next step is to rent a storefront that will serve as the collaborative space for young entrepreneurs to set up an actual shop. The monthly costs will be split among the vendors with our organization serving as the master tenant. The youth now will have the ability to set up their shop at a minimum cost, get exposure since the storefront will become a destination location, and there will be no long term commitment as a way to help mitigate their risks. The young vendors will be supported by the creation of jobs for youth that are not focused on being entrepreneurs. These jobs will be a way to learn valuable work skills for jobs that will be in demand in the near future as they address the issues that youth feel so strongly about. We are already a work training site working with LA County WDACS program Youth at Work. We have trained over 100 youth to date, with great results, both empirical and anecdotal. We currently also partner on a small collaborative boutique in El Sereno. We seek to expand on our model and be able to showcase the entrepreneurial spirit of the area.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "It is working in a progressive environment and although there will always be some universal business constants, some ideas we are implementing have not been done before. The re-creation of how business gets done post Covid is still a fluid environment. This is a natural progression of taking what works economically such as our vendors in an outdoors market, and allowing the ones that have a successful business model to expand on their model and take the next step to having a more permanent location. There is demand from the citizens in our communities to embrace and help guide the youth in a way that best prepares them for the future, the growth of our organization's work is a measure of our success. We already have several success stories of our youth that came to us for training, found our environment impactful enough to want to implement their own ideas. and have implemented their ideas and now run a small business on their own.",

LA County is looking to upgrade several buildings along the surrounding blocks and is actively pursuing implementing several key components. The space has already been identified and is a partnership with a community reinvestment organization (CORE) backed by funding from Genesis LA, and our organization. Our success will be the transition and buildup of the space. Our success will be the roll out of the vendors and the subsequent economic impact in our community with the creation of support jobs, the training and certification of youth as they go through our training program. Success will be the creation of a destination location to work with the County to revitalize the area. It will help usher in a fresh wave of doing business to an area that was heavily impacted by the Covid closures."

One key element of the Epiphany Project is that we subsidize the cost of tattoo removal services for participants. While removing their tattoos, we provide job readiness training to help clients research vocational trades, resume building and mock interviews. Upon program completion, clients are given employment opportunities in places where previously marginalized, and most importantly, a clean slate and a second chance to succeed in our communities.

Through the use of cognitive behavioral concepts, we equip directly-impacted participants with tools and strategies to understand their decision-making and thought processes. When an individual becomes aware of the triggers and emotions that influence their actions, they are able to employ self-assessment and intervention strategies to modify their behavior. It is our goal for participants to realize their purpose and potential through exposure to resources and success strategies that include knowing their rights, understanding laws and judicial systems, exploring career opportunities, and setting goals. The curriculum consists of four phases: Awareness, Intervention, Rights, and Tools. Workshop topics include, but are not limited to, Trauma-Informed: Why Hurt People Hurt People, Self-Awareness & Leadership, Gang & Street Violence, Drugs & Alcohol, Mass Incarceration: Criminal Law & Procedure, War on Immigrants: Crimmigration & Mass Deportations, Pathways to Education, Pathways to Career Readiness, and Financial Literacy."

The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) estimates that 26% of people in homeless shelters have a serious mental illness. The rate is likely higher for those who are unsheltered. In Los Angeles County, that means that more than 17,000 homeless individuals likely have serious mental illness. Specific populations with mental health disabilities are even more prone to homelessness. Transition-age youth (TAY), for example, have higher rates of mental health disabilities and high rates of homelessness. Youth.gov reports that 50% of children involved in the child welfare system and 67% of those involved in the juvenile justice system have mental health disorders. Youth.gov also reports that youth who have lived in foster care have higher rates of mental illness.

During the grant period, MHAS will provide free legal services to 500 low-income individuals with mental health disabilities who are experiencing housing instability. Services will range from brief advice and counsel meetings to more in-depth and extensive legal representation that may last beyond the grant period depending on the needs of each client, legal issues involved, and applicable law. During the course of the grant period, MHAS will also develop partnerships with other community-based organizations to help us identify and serve more people with mental health disabilities who are housing insecure or homeless. Finally, during the grant period, MHAS will conduct at least four awareness and know your rights training sessions to help the Los Angeles social services community better address homelessness for those with mental health disabilities.

MHAS also tracks the outcome of each case, and more than 80% of extended services cases closed last year (direct and indirect housing issues) resulted in favorable actions or resolutions for clients and helped prevent homelessness. MHAS also tracks services for special populations, including an expanded focus on serving TAY with mental health disabilities. We piloted TAY-focused services over the past nine months and have so far helped 30 TAY resolve legal issues and avoid homelessness.

Addressing barriers that impede employment, government benefits, and access to mental health care as well as preventing housing discrimination yield short-term successes for clients. Educating Angelenos with mental health disabilities on their rights as tenants, consumers, employees, and patients is a long-term solution that empowers those with mental health disabilities to become more independent, achieve greater economic security, and improve access to mental health care. Short- and long-term successes will promote self-sufficiency and community engagement for at least 500 Angelenos during the grant period to help them thrive in the community.

Recognizing a lack of employment for young adults, particularly those transitioning out of foster care and/or the juvenile justice system with limited skills – this is an innovative solution for preparing youth for the workplace. Industrial arts job skills training combined with sectoral industry partnerships with aerospace employers reduces unemployment rates among youth and TAY, shifts poverty levels as youth receive living wage employment opportunities, and meets the local aerospace industry's growing and unmet need for quality entry-level employment candidates who know how to work with their hands.

MMCC delivers care to our patients while maintaining their wild nature so they may be released after rehabilitation.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "To date, MMCC has treated over 8,000 marine mammals that would otherwise be left to die on our beaches. MMCC delivers care while maintaining the animal’s wild nature so they may be released after rehabilitation. MMCC serves a critical need for marine animals and for public health. The communities affected would see a negative public health impact and substantial negative public relations issues, without MMCC intervention. If our facility did not exist, state and local governments would incur substantial public safety risks and costs to handle and transport hundreds of sick or injured animals found on our beaches with no local resource to take them in. Our sick animals (some as large as 500 pounds) cannot be left on our beaches to interact with humans – both species pose a threat to one another when they come in contact. MMCC helps mitigate that risk.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Critical to MMCC’s work is access to necessary medical supplies, equipment, and food sources the patients need while in our care. Patient care includes: Rescue: Our patients are brought to our hospital by our rescue partner MAR. Without our hospital there would be nowhere to take these sick and injured animals. Intake: Upon intake, each patient is given an identification number & a daily medical record is initiated to chronicle medical status, food intake, & notable changes in behavior during treatment. This information is used to assess how animals are housed within the facility and when they are ready to move to the next step in the rehabilitation process. Care: Initial interaction with the patient may be labor-intensive, including physical restraint for feedings and medications. As the animal regains normal health & strength, the care team is hands-off, and the animal interacts with people less and less. Our focus is always on keeping the animal as wild as possible to ensure its success upon release back into its natural habitat. Staff feed at least 3x per day, maintain a clean living space, administer medications, and take daily progress notes. Release: Return to the ocean occurs as soon as a patient recovers from its illness or injury, is at proper body weight, and can compete for food. This usually takes a few months after which our attending veterinarian must clear each patient for release, making sure they have met all their rehabilitation milestones.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Success for MMCC means being able to continue our work of rehabilitation for marine mammals stranded on the coast of LA County. We are a critical resource to our community and the only 365/24/7 marine mammal hospital in LA County. Without our work there is simply nowhere for these sick and injured animals to go. Our success is determined by the support we receive from our community to fund the vital role we play in the rescue and rehabilitation of our patients and in understanding the health of marine mammals in our coastal waters.",

Criteria for release are established by NMFS and include qualitative data on weight gain, resolution of medical conditions, ability to compete for food, blood parameters, and an assessment of readiness to return to the ocean. This data, along with quantitative data regarding the number and variety of seals and sea lion patients will be collected. Additionally, prior to release, each patient receives a small orange tag in one of their flippers possessing a unique number. These tags may remain with the animal for years; reports of tagged animals provide information about survival and location. Reading the tag number requires close proximity to the animal and is not always possible when the animal is healthy and surviving in the wild. To obtain more detailed post-release information, satellite tracking is used. Although extremely expensive, when feasible, satellite tracking provides critical information to our research team.",

Our young apprentice spent 10 days building a cargo bicycle for a local bread maker looking to sell her goods at farmer’s markets. The proof of concept was delivered and today our young apprentice will be entering a welding program at Los Angeles Trade Tech College and our client has since gotten rid of her car. This account exemplifies the cross-sectional impact that Re:Ciclos produces. Through miles traveled on our cargo bikes, materials diverted from the waste stream, greenhouse gas emissions reduced, car congestion lessened and more active-transportation space utilized, our program both helps our clients and apprentices lead by example and helps our city generate and track vital usage and mapping data on the environmental, social and political benefits to our diverse communities when we have access to clean, just and fun mobility.",

Our project strives to continue to create strong and impactful programming and to replicate its efforts around the county in community maker spaces, bicycle repair co-ops and educational institutions in an effort to provide this essential resource to as many communities as possible. The benefits of the Re:Ciclos cargo bike project include: >Reduced greenhouse gas emissions >More peaceful and healthy communities and community members >Youth empowerment and leadership building >Improved congestion, as 60% of car trips made are 5 miles or less >Active transportation and engaging civic life >Reinvestment in local economies by creating human-scaled cycles of commerce"

The play-based digital art and interactive media arcade is designed as experiential retail for the reduction of cognitive dissonance. After the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 Global Pandemic, millions of people across our nation are asking themselves, who am I? These last few years of deep suffering financially, physically, socially, emotionally, and mentally will require behavioral health interventions to be addressed. The posture many Americans took on to survive the pandemic will not help them thrive in a post pandemic reality. In order to combat the grief of job loss, loved ones passing away, severe isolation, and the \"shadow pandemic\" of mental illness people will need \"meaning making\" assistance. According to a recent study, African American boys between the ages of 5 and 12 are more likely to die by suicide than any other age group. Nationwide, suicides among Black children under 18 are up 71 percent in the past decade. Brain development, stabilized nervous systems, and cognition are built on foundations of pleasure and play whereas toxic stress like a global pandemic decreases executive function. Play is central to how we learn, explore and form community, and make sense of life. Our play stations can induce nervous system stabilization kin to mindfulness meditation and serve as a social support which is a top interventionist response to onset trauma."

While women are overrepresented in arts jobs, they are underrepresented in leadership positions (Data Dance Project). In Los Angeles, the largest, most-resourced dance companies are run by men. In the commercial industry, it is still commonplace for a cast of all-women dancers to work on a project entirely run by men. Women choreographers, especially in early/mid career stages, can struggle finding artistic development opportunities and platforms for their work to gain the same visibility as their male counterparts. ​​Cultural Consultant Harpreet Kaur sums up a broader issue: “When there is no democratic choice to express creativity equally for all, this also means that there is no freedom of representation and hence populism becomes politically arranged. If female choreographers are not given an equal chance to present their work this is not just a problem for the contemporary dance sector, but for society as a whole.”",

Once the meals have left our premises, the chef and volunteers, clean the kitchen, and organize for the next day’s work. We are a very lean organization. The chef and a part-time office manager, are the only paid staff. Everyone else, including the board, are volunteers. We share a kitchen with the local Presbyterian Church, for a discounted rent. We get donations of food and produce from local stores, bakeries, farmers’ markets and a local farm (yes, there is a small farm in San Pedro!). We also get cash donations from local residents and apply for any relevant grants. Other food programs are not local, and do not supply freshly made meals, nor do they give the human contact. Delivery volunteers stick to the same route, so they get to know our clients and form a relationship with them, often they are the only person that a client will see all day.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "San Pedro Meals on Wheels is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Pre-Covid we were serving 40 subsidized meals a day. We are now serving 120 meals. We have expanded our program to deal with this, without taking on any additional staff. In 50 years, we have never failed to deliver food. We also provide additional small gifts for Christmas, Valentine’s day etc. On the back of the weekly menu, we print interesting facts about San Pedro, or timely quotations. Client testimonials: “I was the only cook in the family. I can’t stand now, so I can’t do any cooking. I don’t know how we would survive without them. SP MoW has very nice people.” “My doctor says, you stay on Meals on wheels, it’s changed my life, it really has.” Since I started using SP MoW I’ve gained weight, I needed to, since I left hospital. I really count on SP MoW. I mean it’s changed my life. They really know what they are doing. It’s a God-send, and the people are so nice…they’ve saved my life.”",

We hope that by continuing to provide meals, people will not have to make the hard choice between food and needed medication or paying the rent. Funds permitting, we would like to expand this program to include those on the waiting list. Sadly, it is unrealistic to think that in the foreseeable future, there will be no need for this program, particularly with rising food prices. Therefore, our long-term vision is the same as our short-term vision. It is our fervent hope that as a result of our work, that there will be a few less sick and homeless people in Los Angeles County."

It also became more critical. The LA Times reported that nearly half of LAUSD students have been chronically absent in 2021-2022, and fewer than 1 in 10 students engaged in tutoring, despite its proven efficacy. The LA Times also reported that “more than a third of students didn’t have an appropriate and quiet place at home to study or participate in online learning.” During the safer-at-home stage of the pandemic, the gap in grades between Latinx and Black students, compared to their Asian and White counterparts, grew by as much as 21%.",

The campaign’s goals are to: (1) transition their schools and districts to 100% renewable energy; (2) commit to rigorous energy efficiency; and (3) secure environmental justice and equity education. STF members are raising their voices, pressing school administrators and district bureaucracies to act. “Individual actions are great, but we need more than meatless Mondays or riding our bikes to stop the climate crisis,” said one student leader. In addition to meeting with decision-makers, STFers are surveying teachers and students to identify access to climate education and encourage educators to embed it across subjects. Students believe the key to their advocacy starts with education. They will work with the STF team to develop curriculum, resources, and materials and support teacher professional development trainings. Students are also hosting experiential tent events, guest speakers, film screenings, workshops, and classroom presentations to engage their school communities in their advocacy.

    "summary": "Our vision starts with an anti-racist Claremont. Our goal is to make our community safer for Black and Latino residents by reducing unnecessary police interactions. We aim to achieve this by decreasing the policing budget and reinvesting in Human Services that can provide wraparound mental health, housing, and social services.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Nearly 60% of LA County residents live in small cities. That means that most policies and decisions in our county are happening in small towns like Claremont. We believe it is critical to develop a scalable initiative to build power in BIPOC communities. Our vision of success is as follows: CPD’s budget is reduced by 25% ($3.25 million) and reinvested in the Human Services department. The Human Services department has the capacity to provide wraparound mental health, housing, and social services to the Claremont community. The Human Services department can respond to nonviolent calls for services. That 35% of city leadership is comprised of people of color, equalling their demographic representation in Claremont. Success means that constituents know how to impact policy decisions and how to advocate on their own behalf. Success means that anti-racism is prioritized by city leadership, not only in sentiment but in writing.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 15,000",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Our police department (CPD) disproportionately interacts with and harasses Black and Latino residents. Data shows that 18% of those stopped by CPD are Black, yet they make up only 5% of the Claremont population. Data on the school resource officer indicates that Black and Latino students account for twice as many citations and arrests as their white counterparts. Testimonies and public comments from people of color in Claremont speak to the repeated harassment and lack of comfort and safety. National and local data make it clear that increased interactions between police and people of color lead to overcriminalization and punitive measures at over twice the rate of white people. While concerning, these data points are unsurprising given that Claremont’s budget allocates 54% of its general fund to the police department while Human Services receives only 7%. This means that Claremont is prioritizing a department that reduces the quality of life and safety of people of color.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our impact will be measured by 1) observing a lower disproportionality of arrests and profiling among Black residents using Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA) Stop Data, 2) reducing the number of calls for service directed and responded to by armed officers, 3) reducing the police budget while increasing the human services budget, and 4) increasing the proportion of non-white members in local leadership. To date, dialogue in our community has significantly changed due to our sustained efforts. We advocated for a more diverse and inclusive Police Commission, which resulted in its expansion from 7 to 9 residents. We have assisted two progressives in campaigning for city council seats. We have asked the police commission to complete an audit of calls for service. We led the effort and successfully advocated for improved community input when determining annual city priorities and budgets.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our goal is to reduce the frequency of interactions between police and Black and Latino people in Claremont by focusing on calls for service and the city budget. Our initiative has four stages. The first stage is to lobby the police commission to review calls for service in order to determine the percentage of calls for service that should not require an armed officer. Subsequently, we will be initiating a workshop series detailing anti-racism, how to engage city leadership, and how to build a budget that prioritizes the safety of Black and Latino residents. Then we will mobilize our community and build power to advocate for the redirection of funding from the police department to the Human Services department at City Council and commission meetings. This will focus on developing a robust Human Services department that can provide wraparound social services that are currently lacking in Claremont. The fourth stage is to improve representation within city leadership by resources and support for Black and Latino residents interested in running for open seats. The four stages of our initiative aim to recenter Black and Latino residents by building power through data, education, engagement, and representation in local government. This will result in decreased interactions with police and increased critical social services that improve physical and psychological safety.",

Nearly 90% suffer from bipolar, depression, anxiety, or PTSD, compared to 20% of the general population. In 2016, troubled by how many former foster youth were on Skid Row, entrepreneur Garrett Underwood launched a youth jobs program. Though it employed 100 youth in its first year, the death of a young man brought Garrett face-to-face with the fact that jobs aren’t enough. Cameron had advanced through the program to gain full-time work, housing, and a car, but later relapsed into substance addiction. He was soon homeless again. Garrett later learned on social media that Cameron had passed away. The isolation many youth feel as they exit foster care leaves them vulnerable to substance abuse and other trauma-bonding behaviors. In honor of Cameron, Garrett founded Seed House Project to help youth find not just jobs and housing, but hope.",

We connected the remaining 20% to a higher level of care to ensure they could continue to receive more intensive support based on their needs. During the pilot year of our new Purpose Therapy program, we will focus on developing best practices for the program by refining the specific workshops, activities, and therapeutic tools that are most effective for participants. We will solicit resident feedback on a continuous basis to improve the program.

We help our residents establish stability through housing, job training, internship and job placement, financial literacy coaching, and academic tutoring. But more than just stability, we are interested in transformation. Through personal development workshops, entrepreneurship and business coaching, and onsite creative resources – including a music studio and podcast equipment – residents explore creative outlets, build perspective and confidence, and develop a positive vision for the future. Year after year, the creative tools at our house have helped residents find solace and practice self-expression amid chaotic or challenging life circumstances. With their input, we are now launching a unique “Purpose Therapy” program to help former foster youth experience even greater personal transformation. Taking advantage of our onsite creative equipment, our Purpose Therapy program will leverage a variety of creative modalities including art and music, combined with trauma-informed clinical therapy, to help young adults build skills and perspectives to serve them over their entire lives. Residents will participate in therapy, coaching, and workshops, all geared toward help them process traumatic experiences, build resilience, and develop a meaningful life direction that includes both personal fulfillment and advocacy for positive change.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Finding self-fulfillment, achieving one’s full potential, and expressing creative needs are defined under Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs as “self-actualization” needs, the top tier of the hierarchy. We believe that by pursuing these higher-level needs, young adults can build the motivation and resilience that, along with adequate physical resources, can prevent long-term cycles of poverty, substance abuse, trauma, and despair. Many social services help individuals meet basic needs – food, shelter, jobs – but do not help them experience lasting change. The severe risks facing youth exiting foster care highlight that traditional “deficit-based” approaches are often quick fixes for deeper-rooted problems. Using an “asset-based” approach, our Purpose Therapy program will ensure that young adults exit foster care not just with housing and jobs, but with productive mindset and lifestyle habits to support them throughout their lives.",

In 2018 the fashion industry contributed 4% of the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions, more than the carbon output of France, Germany & the United Kingdom combined. Over 13 billion tons of discarded clothing and fabric is sent to US landfills each year. In addition to the environmental impact, garment workers, 75% of whom are young women, are among some of the lowest paid workers, both overseas and here at home. Despite all of this, the typical consumer is blissfully unaware of these devastating impacts. The EPA regulations have led large brands to take advantage of lax environmental laws and cheap labor overseas, keeping the majority of these practices far from western eyes. However, when taking a closer look at the fashion district in DTLA, it is obvious that these practices are just as common in our own backyard.",

When it comes to influence, Roboro is affecting global culture by highlighting upcycled, sustainable fashion on the global stage at events such as the 2022 Academy Awards. We produced a red carpet gown for producer Charlotte Sanchez, from the 3 time Oscar nominated film ‘Flee’. But all of this is fame, influence and exposure. In regards to measurable impact, we like everyone else jumped to help in 2020 when the Coronavirus pandemic hit. We instituted a mask sponsorship program for essential workers, producing over 3k upcycled masks and diverting over 200 yards of fabric, in a 3 week period.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "As a leader in the fashion industry, both here at home and abroad, Los Angeles stands to be an example of how we can improve industry wide practices and reverse the damage we are doing to our city and planet. Los Angeles is known worldwide for its climate, trend setting, art, culture and influence. We can use that platform to elevate our citywide goal to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions 40% below the 1990 levels by 2030. We can elevate the socio-economic standing of it’s more than 45,000 garment workers, who are primarily Lantino/a and Asian immigrants. We can improve the air quality for Los Angeles residents by implementing solutions to reduce our textile waste which requires enormous amounts of transportation. We can address the water shortage by identifying wasteful practices in fabric production, dying and treatments.

This project targets two issues which contribute to high incarceration and rearrest rates. First, the unemployment rate for formerly incarcerated people is nearly five times higher than the rate for the general population. LA2050 funds will provide stipends and cover fees for participants, which are critical in establishing financial stability upon release from incarceration. Further, incarcerated people in California receive 8-37 cents/hour in regular jobs and 30-95 cents/hour in prison industry jobs. When they are released, many people struggle to pay for necessities, so grant funding will allow students to focus on their studies and career instead of just surviving. Second, incarcerated people are more likely to have experienced abuse and trauma even before entering prison, which this project will directly address via trauma-informed, healing arts education and career pathways.",

We have high job placement numbers in the entertainment industry and high rates of participation in our arts groups. Impact can also be measured by the output of creative materials including performances, songs, and the placement of members into entertainment unions. The arts have been proven to be effective therapeutic interventions that support peoples’ reintegration into society post-incarceration. The most significant evidence of the efficacy of our approach is our Membership recidivism rate (defined as a new conviction within 3 years of release) of only 10%. This rate is low in comparison to the Statewide recidivism rate of over 40% for adults and >60% for young people.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Earthseed Lab will unite a cohort of young leaders (‘fellows’) - community college students and young activists - with experienced practitioners (‘facilitators’). Together the fellows and facilitators will complete a 10-week training followed by a project addressing a local climate issue. The goal is to grow capacity while charting a path forward through practical action. Facilitators will codesign a 10-week curriculum centered on local climate issues, civic engagement, and community organizing delivered through focus groups, workshops, and other interactive field activities. Fellows and facilitators will share skills and wisdom in both directions, each growing their practice as a result. And Earthseed will provide stipends to both, making a supportive space for creative problem-solving. After the training, the facilitators will guide the fellows through a structured process to identify a community campaign or project to work on. They will explore local climate adaptation needs, identify community priorities, set objectives, make a plan of action, and execute the project. Finally, the facilitators and fellows will evaluate the first year of Earthseed Lab and plan for the next. They will create a field guide handbook and online portal to share the 10-week curriculum and lessons learned with nonprofit, educational, and government actors. The facilitators will also provide continued support to the fellows as they identify next steps in their education and careers.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Earthseed Lab will give educational and professional growth opportunities to underserved youth, including mentorship for future careers in community organizing, civic engagement, and government. Youth climate activists will gain the tools to make positive changes across many intersectional community issues and will become aware of new pathways for environmental community work. This capacity and coalition-building program will foster a group of strong Angeleno leaders with the skills to adapt to unknown futures caused by climate change. Their experience with Earthseed Lab’s creative thinking framework will lead to innovative, new climate solutions. These leaders will guide Los Angeles towards a culture of civic engagement, bioregionalism, and community resilience. In addition, as organizations, educational institutions, and government agencies utilize our field guide and community portal, we will see a growing number of Angelenos step into these adaptive leadership roles.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We are entering an era of climate disruption. The only certainty is Angelenos’ lives will change forever in the coming decades. L.A. is already experiencing record-breaking heat and drought on top of local air and water pollution. Our vulnerable communities are ill-prepared for the massive and painful changes facing us. The choice is not if we transform, but how. At the same time, we are in a crisis of disconnection. Climate change is seen as a global catastrophe that ordinary people are powerless to stop. Many of us feel helpless and depressed, lacking the time, money, knowledge, or support to act. Swept up in the frenetic digital world, we forget our home: the local issues we can address, the wisdom and community we can find, the beauty we can all agree needs protecting. Instead of disruption and disconnection, Earthseed Lab is a place for continuity and connection to ensure a just, peaceful climate transition for LA.",

At the end of the project, year results will be compiled into a final evaluation report to measure success toward reaching project goals. The quality of the project will be measured by the following: Pre/post surveys for participants measuring skills, attitudes, and behaviors · Surveys for participants measuring engagement and project effectiveness · Surveys for facilitators measuring ongoing overall effectiveness from their perspective · Surveys for community partners to determine satisfaction and feedback · Focus groups with participants, facilitators, and members of partnering community- based organizations measuring overall effectiveness and suggestions for improvement",

The College Access Program serves students beginning in the 8th grade. For three years, students are equipped with the guidance and support of a mentor as they navigate through the challenges of high school and college applications. This extensive program provides at-risk youth an average of 360 hours of personal mentoring, 150 hours of enrichment programming, one-on-one tutoring and counseling as needed. Many of our volunteer mentors are actively involved in the community and offer OJS students the opportunity to participate in a variety of community outreach and extracurricular experiences, leading by example. College Success provides enhanced support to high school upperclassmen and college students. This program, beginning in the 11th grade and following students until they graduate college, ensures academic success as students navigate college admission and matriculation. Through College Success, high school juniors and seniors receive educational programming, case management sessions that address the transition to college for students and their parents, college application assistance, scholarships and support navigating the federal financial aid system. The students who have begun their college journey received emotional and financial support, academic guidance, alumni mixers and academic webinars.

Although the graduation rates have significantly improved in Long Beach for our population, those who do graduate are not always properly prepared to pursue a college education. OJS works to eliminate the achievement gap created when underserved students are not prepared for the educational rigor of college. In 2017, only 13% of 24-year-olds from the lowest income quartile and 20% from the second-lowest quartile had earned bachelor’s degrees, compared with 62% of students from the highest income quartile and 47% from the third-highest quartile (Pell institute, 2019).

The comprehensive interventions of OJS have proven successful over time. Every single graduate of the program has received an on-time high school diploma, 95% of those students immediately went on to college. Since 2006, 93% of our students began their education at a 4-year college or university, which significantly increased their odds of obtaining a degree. Our 6-year bachelor’s degree attainment rate is 75%. Most of our students reside in Los Angeles County following college and become active members and leaders of our community.

Our computer lab is outfitted with computers for students to complete homework with supervision and help. We keep students off the street, supervised, and supported. We are adapting this model for summer. Our summer school will use individualized programs to support each students’ specific needs. Students will first take tests to determine their level and what they need to strengthen their academic foundations.

Without transportation, getting jobs elsewhere is difficult. Many adults in the neighborhood also didn’t complete their education, which makes finding good jobs harder.When students get a high-quality education, their prospects for the future improve, but the education gap impedes this.There are a lot of reasons this gap exists, from the lack of funding for the internet and books at home to the inability of parents to help with homework.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Building increased employment in the community will stimulate the local economy.

Focusing on the economic and professional needs of adults builds a community with less need and more disposable income to infuse into the local economy. By supporting students, we hope to improve understanding, grades, and test scores. With increased literacy skills, better test scores, and better grades, students are more likely to complete high school and go to college. This lowers drop-out rates and increases employment. Having a good education and a safe space to spend their free time has also been shown to lower gang enrollment rates. The more people feel supported and included in their community, the more they support their community in return. Those who get the help they need are more likely to help others.",

We will also use employment and education statistics for adults to see if our programs, resource fairs, and events are having an effect on adult education, entrepreneurship, and career-building.To measure the effectiveness of our educational programs we will be looking at test scores and grades as provided by families and local schools. Our summer school program uses an individualized program that makes it easy to measure progress and track improvements in all school subjects. By looking at overall statistics, adult programs, and youth programs we will get a full picture of our impact."

This pilot prioritizes and tests person-to-person engagement led by community and Surfrider leaders to increase resident engagement in actions, while centering community-specific needs and voices. It provides on-the-ground, community-centered support for residents to take action by organizing communities for a more resilient future. To build on the Surfrider Foundation's strengths in citizen engagement and activism, this pilot leverages and tests the Dashboard.Earth platform as an organizing tool and vehicle for verifying measurable, ecological outcomes, with the aim to increase resident engagement in climate actions, reduce barriers to taking action, and therefore, increase ecological and social resilience in Los Angeles.

Survivors are underrepresented, oppressed, and have experienced trauma. They must navigate this system on their own, without attorneys, in court, face their abuser who has the right to cross-examine them.

All the burden of being a immigrant survivor falls on them. They call a hotline, call police, move out, change jobs, change schools, represent themselves in court- and while empowerment and taking control is critical, up to this point the survivor had no control over their own lives and now are expected to figure out the entire complicated system on their own. Integrated systems we support shift the burden to the community to truly support the immigrant survivor.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If our work is successful, there will be more viable career pathways and economic opportunities for youth within Los Angeles, supporting Los Angeles teams and facilities. Students’ minds can be opened to the various opportunities and successful career pathways that sports provide, all while staying local and continuing their education. A more engaged and economically prosperous youth will continue to support Los Angeles and foster a sense of civic engagement, pride and prosperity for decades to come.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Los Angeles is a city with an unmatched sports legacy, from the 1984 Olympics through the present day, with an abundance of professional sports teams, events, and facilities. There are so many fulfilling and productive educational and career opportunities to be had within the sports industry right in one’s own city, all requiring a diverse range of skill sets and interests. However, it can feel intimidating to break into the sports industry and secure various certifications needed to build a resume - this program seems to reduce those barriers by providing pathways and showing the diversity of thought, experience, and background that can be found in sports industry professionals. Through these career pathways initiatives, we can provide meaningful paths to employment and purpose, all right in our students’ own backyards.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We will initially measure success by the number of students who enroll in and complete these pathways, with the end goal of seeing successful job placements and career pathways. Like with any new pathway, it takes time for adoption, but we expect 50 students per school at 20 middle and high school campuses within the Compton Unified School District during the 2022-2023 school year to begin the program.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Our pipeline begins with the Coaching and Officiating Certification Program for Middle and High School students. In order to become a grassroots referee in California, there is a specific CIF certification required. We will work with CIF-accredited organizations, including the United States Tennis Association (USTA) and USA Soccer, to certify eligible students, as every sport requires a different process. We are preparing students to be eligible to get their certifications in various sports as they age-in. We view this as a workforce development opportunity as well as a leadership and character building opportunity. It will be free of cost for all students to participate in the training and receive their certification. They will then be paid by the respective sports bodies to officiate games. Our pilot will be ~25 students, with room to increase based on interest. This program will also serve as part of the Facilities Management College Career Technical Education (CTE) Pathway Course that will roll out at CUSD high schools in Fall 2022. This is the first of its kind sports facility-related CTE in the United States. Like with other CTE programs, students will receive college credit while in high school. This CTE will become a pipeline to the facilities management degree program we are implementing at Compton College in 2023.",

We will partner with preschools in LA County to ensure full access to the arts for all eligible children. From The Public Policy Institute of CA “In hopes of leveling the playing field…, California will expand Transitional Kindergarten to all four-year olds by fall 2025.Kindergarten students in CA have some of the largest gaps in school readiness in the country—and greater access to high-quality early learning is a proven way to reduce these disparities.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In the short term we will build the Pre-K program and prepare it for use in the 2023-24 school year. The immediate impact upon launch will provide a tool for teachers that gives our youngest learners a path to wellness - learning arts, self-awareness, identity and the ability to express their feelings in words. Building arts-based social-emotional programming into learning positively impacts children’s academic progress and workforce readiness. 100% of teachers using the Secrets of the Heart program for Kindergarten and 1st grade report their students cultivated a greater appreciation of culture and diversity. In the long term, early education that promotes taking pride in oneself and teaches respect for other cultures will result in a new generation where our citizens feel connected to one another and more comfortable with who they are and why they are here. This project drastically reduces the cost of enrichment for underserved communities and more children will be served in LA."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "LA County has over 20,000 children in foster care, second only to New York City. California consistently has the highest rate of human trafficking in the USA. Those most at-risk of being exploited and trafficked are the most vulnerable in LA County, transitional kids in foster care who are approaching 18 and will “age out” of the foster care system. The challenges these youth face are numerous: unstable housing or homelessness, an inability to access post-secondary education or job training, unemployment, a lack of healthcare, and much more. For a transition into adulthood to be successful, these youths need to have well-developed self-esteem and self-efficacy skills to prepare them to manage all the challenges they will face. Brave therefore developed in-person and virtual training programs specifically designed to address the unique needs transitional kids face, addressing issues unique to these young adults (identity, consent, the effects of sexual violence, mentorship).",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Brave seeks to expand into South-Central Los Angeles by hosting a Brave Empowerment Event and hiring an LA County Coordinator. Empowerment Events are in-person opportunities for youth to be inspired by motivational speakers (many of whom were foster youth and/or are sexual abuse survivors), entertainment, activities, food, and giveaways. The events also serve to bring together victims of human trafficking to reinforce the message that “You are seen,” and “You are cared for” by coordinating the caregivers, teachers, and service providers that rally to equip and protect LA’s most vulnerable youth. An LA County Coordinator will support the expansion of programmatic oversight to the LA region, as well as the services initiated at the event. LA youth will be connected to the Brave Leadership Academy (BLA), which gives victims intensive leadership and growth skills through a caring community and one-on-one mentor focused on public speaking, event planning, small group leading, peace making, and collaboration. Another key tool for success is providing the youth with Brave Journals, written by local women who endured and overcame difficult circumstances such as foster care, sexual abuse, and the juvenile justice system. They focus on identity, self-worth, healthy relationships, mental health, and boundaries through reflection activities, exercises, and empowering affirmations. This initiative will also focus on translating these effective journals into Spanish.",

Brave seeks to cast a spotlight into society’s shadows, where young people who have become callous to being neglected are cherished and restored to take power over their own futures. If implemented in South Los Angeles, Brave hopes to rally the voices of parents, caregivers, teachers, service providers, and the foster system as a whole to give power back to the youth who have grown up with little say over their day, week, or year ahead and empower them to be Brave for their communities in 2025, 2030, 2040, and 2050… and beyond.",

Over the course of the six business development seminars, eager and established entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to develop a business plan, gather best methods in securing funding, learn successful market entry strategies, create product value, become skilled at business financial bookkeeping, and touch on business law key points that every business owner should be adept. AltaSea will complement the program with expert speakers from the rapidly emerging blue/green economy who will introduce innovative and prosperous business opportunities within a host of ocean technologies. For instance, combatting climate change through carbon sequestration methods, producing food through regenerative aquaculture, and exploring the ocean floor using robotics. The renewable power industry is reinventing the way power is distributed, stored and consumed and green technology in solar, wind, wave and hydrogen power is limitless.

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We have created several measuring tools to help us understand the quantitative and qualitative impact around period poverty and menstrual health awareness. We have created numerous assessments to collect data from the public to be able to inform what needs to be included in our curriculum and programs. Our assessments have given us data around age, ethnicity, location, symptoms, treatments and even experiences with doctors. We also measure our #HappyPeriod for Self program with Pre and Post assessments. This helps us understand our program's impact with girls ages 9-17 and the education that is learned from the program. Evaluation results from the most recent workshop of 23 participants includes: - 8 teenaged girls said they did not know a lot about periods however 22 said by the end of the workshop they had more knowledge - 22 out of 23 felt comfortable sharing their thoughts about periods or details about their own period - 22 out of 23 learned something new about their body.",

According to a 2021 survey centered on the state of the periods of students in the U.S.; 1 out of 4 teens miss class because of lack of access to period products, 23% of students have struggled to afford period products, 77% of students believe there needs to be more in- depth education about menstrual health, 51% of students have worn period products for longer than recommended, 85% of students agree that public schools should provide free period products, and 65% agree that society teaches people to be ashamed of their periods. We know that low income women from racial minority backgrounds are disproportionately affected and from the 2019 census we know Los Angeles County minority population is “73%” , which is a large portion of the population that has a higher rate of being susceptible to reproductive health issues.",

This program is essentially an in-person event that includes a structured workshop with a comprehensive lesson plan. Participants will have an opportunity to learn in depth about menstruation including menstrual products, menstrual-related disorders, and self-care strategies. Participants will be able to take advantage of the workshop by not only going into detail about menstruation but also having questions answered by a facilitator who is knowledgeable in menstrual health. Each participant will also receive free period products to take home at the end of the event. With this program we will also present the option to install our vending machine, we named PPE, which stands for \"Period Protection Essentials\". This dispenser is suitable for public spaces like school campuses, libraries, community centers, or even shelters that are in need of menstrual products, like pads, tampons, and panty liners.",

The motion does not include educational resources so this is where #HappyPeriod's program could be most impactful and helpful to LA County, as there's an alignment for a partnership. We can work with the County to provide our program, including our resources and a dispenser, at select venues. This way communities will have access to menstrual care education and safe period products.",

We will also produce and distribute a wide array of forward-looking material inspired by interviews with visionary thinkers, experts and even futurists versed in these issues. The goal: provide an accessible roadmap for how we get out of this fossil fuel mess to alleviate climate change pressures. We’ve spent years highlighting inequality and environmental degradation, and now seek to leverage that experience into a probing search for solutions. We will send reporters into the oil fields of L.A. County, to convey which neighboring communities suffer most from the status quo, while we simultaneously explore the most effective efforts to transition to a cleaner, greener future. Collectively, we want this project to act as something of a roadmap for Angelenos, to help them see that this sort of change is possible — and how it might happen. Capital & Main co-publishes with media around the country — including USA Today, La Opinión, Newsweek, Fortune, Fast Company, L.A. Taco, and dozens of others — so we would seek to use the story of Los Angeles’ transition to inspire other cities. L.A. has often been at the forefront of change in America, and this is an issue where the city can provide truly consequential leadership. If car-culture L.A. can transform, couldn’t virtually any city?",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Powering Los Angeles without fossil fuels can seem unrealistic if only because we don’t currently know exactly how it will happen. Partly, this is due to a lack of practical imagination, but more so to a lack of an organized vision that brings together the disparate efforts in a coherent narrative. This is what we intend to do during the year we focus on this project. As fires, pollution, droughts and increasingly violent weather around the state make clear, we are in the midst of a climate emergency. We intend to produce powerful content for widespread distribution that will connect the dots for Angelenos so they understand the problems we face, how their actions play into them, what forces are aggravating the situation, and where plausible solutions reside. As journalists, we cannot directly solve the problems and move beyond fossil fuels in L.A. in a generation, but we can ring the alarm bells and provide coherent and convincing plans to convince voters and policymakers.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We face worsening climate-related risks due to fossil fuels we burn to power millions of cars, cook most food, and heat many homes and businesses. We also pump a great deal of oil in L.A. — some for use in the U.S., and some for export. All of this aggravates climate change. We are so immersed in oil in L.A., both geographically and economically, we rarely notice it. Oil derricks tower over us and burrow beneath our homes. At times, they hide in plain sight; just off the Fairfax High School campus, next to the Beverly Center, throughout the hills between Culver City and Inglewood, and around Wilmington, and beyond. As replacement technology and infrastructure improves, big questions about the renewable transition remain on financing, cost, equity, policy, incentives for energy producers and others. But ending oil use will result in a cleaner Pacific Ocean, better air, healthier food, and improved health for Angelenos, and more residential space to respond to the housing crunch.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We have been investigating and writing about climate change for years, and recently expanded such coverage. We regularly compile metrics on the audiences we reach on our own site, via social media, and through the audiences of our (100-plus) co-publishing partners. Our reach has grown exponentially in recent years, and we expect that to continue as we establish new media partnerships with publications, radio/podcasts and TV specifically tailored to the relevant issues (the environment, social justice, racial equity, urban renewal, etc.). Another measure of our work involves fundraising. At our recent annual Exposés fundraiser, we honored Oscar-winning Director Adam McKay for his climate-focused film, Don’t Look Up, and his generous support of our climate journalism. Mr. McKay brings attention and financial support to Capital & Main, partly by acting as a megaphone for our climate-related work.

From planting trees to cool streets and sequester carbon, to curating walks, to stimulating stakeholder engagement to effect local policy, our project will communicate that that environment is not out there, it is HERE. We will plant 100 trees in the tree wells and unimproved parkways on 10 streets that access the Hollywood Central Park. This builds a network of green streets enhancing residential streets, supplying tree canopy for shade, reducing heat island effects, absorbing pollutants, and promoting health and wellbeing. Extreme heat isn’t a joke (WaPo 6/17/22) reminds us of the importance and power of a newly planted tree. At each tree a QR code will provide tree specific information, useful facts and figures about street trees, such as trees in urban areas reduce the energy spent on heating and cooling by 7%. The trees planted closest to the Hollywood Central Park will speak to reconnecting our neighborhoods separated for nearly 70 years by the construction of US 101, providing a 38-acre park that protects the environment and provides a healthy quality of life and how this climate-resilient infrastructure project now in development, will craft a livable and sustainable community.

We must recognize that tree canopy is not just a beautification measure, but a central piece of our infrastructure.” Rachel Malarich LA's chief forest officer. The most severe harms from climate change fall disproportionately upon underserved communities who are least able to prepare for and recover from extreme heat and poor air quality. The obesity, hypertension, and diabetes rates among children under 18 within this area are among the highest in Los Angeles, due to physical inactivity. As the impacts of climate change get worse, people least able to prepare and cope are disproportionately exposed. This inequity can be changed through projects and policies that achieve both climate mitigation (green space, park access and trees) and adaptation (reduce the vulnerability of social and biological systems) in disadvantaged communities."

The Youth Ambassadors program provides direct services and focused experiences for high school students, ages 13-18, nominated by educators who oversee Genders and Sexualities Alliance clubs across Los Angeles. Providing skills, information, and the confidence to achieve, the program trains students to serve as Youth Ambassadors for LGBTQ history at their schools and offers LGBTQ+ cultural enrichment activities to their peers. Youspeak Radio is an extension project of the Youth Ambassadors program. It is sound-based exploration of intergenerational dialogs led by LGBTQ youth. As most youth do not share LGBTQ+ experiences with their family members, combatting teen suicide is the work of a whole community, across generations and in daily life including home, school, and extracurricular activities. Students acquire skills including storytelling, interview techniques, and technical experience with audio recording and production. With guidance from staff and podcast professionals, each participant generates one story recording. We aim to produce 10 - 12 recordings annually.

Youth mentoring programs are an important strategy for supporting and addressing the challenges that at-risk youth experience. A meta-analysis of evaluations of more than 73 independent mentoring programs found positive effects on the youths’ social, behavioral, emotional, and academic development, while non-mentored youth showed declines in some of the same areas.

Through our Operation Housing First Program, RightWay signs the Master Lease of scattered apartment sites around Los Angeles, provides first and last month’s rent, and subsidizes a portion of rent for one year while providing youth with intensive mental health support, employment services, and case management. Financial capability services are provided to guide youth through budgeting and saving the portion of rent that RightWay covers. With our partners, supporters, and sponsors, RightWay assists each youth in fully furnishing their new apartment to create a warm and welcoming home with all basic needs met. All participants become fully immersed in RightWay’s trauma-informed job-readiness program Operation Emancipation, designed to target areas critical to a foster youth’s ability to retain employment and progress on a path toward self-sufficiency. RightWay participants have direct access to trainings, stipends, financial assistance and employment opportunities. Youth are connected to paid internships and apprenticeships to strengthen resumes, build financial stability, provide meaningful work experience, and serve as crucial stepping-stones to full-time employment.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Youth involved in the foster care system experience a significant amount of trauma and instability without receiving the support that is critical to their healing, emotional well-being, and self-sufficiency. Studies show young people exiting the system encounter high rates of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), unemployment, homelessness, incarceration, and social isolation, citing trauma as an underlying factor. A 2019 survey conducted by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) revealed that about one-third of young people (ages 18-24) experiencing homelessness had exited the foster care system. A young person’s risk of experiencing homelessness upon emancipation increases without sufficient preparation to enter the workforce. Without trauma-informed job readiness support, past trauma can be carried into the workplace, affecting a young person’s ability to retain employment, earn a living wage, and maintain stable housing."

    "yearSubmitted": "2022",
    "organization": "JYBE, Inc.",
    "summary": "Reducing LA County’s solid waste and greenhouse gas footprints is as urgent as it is complicated. One method that would reduce both at the same time is through the replacement of single-use plastic (SUP) foodware at nearly 20,000 restaurants across L.A. County. An education campaign combined with assistance in choosing simple swaps for common products can spark meaningful change in the adoption of sustainable materials.",
    "goal": "LIVE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "All this waste has a measurable impact on L.A. In our first year, we hope to dramatically raise awareness of the problems with SUP and spur a willingness to adapt. Over the long-term, we hope to effect dramatic change in usage habits. Assume each of the 19,500 restaurants serves a reasonable average of 250 meals per day. If each meal includes 3 plastic food containers, two plastic beverage bottles, and two sauce ramekins or plastic pouches, that's 6 oz. of plastic; the total amount used would be 94 lbs. per day! Across 19,500 restaurants, that translates to 500 tons of plastic per day or 182,500 tons per year. Most of that would be either non-recyclable or non-biodegradable. So-called ‘compostable’ plastic doesn’t naturally degrade and requires a special processing facility that L.A. County does not have. Switching materials to paper – which will recycle or naturally degrade, or glass and aluminum, which are recycled at a rate above 50%, dramatically reduces landfill-bound waste.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Single-use plastic foodware is estimated to comprise about 40% of SUP waste in the solid waste stream, and is a major component of overall trash collection. The chemicals in single-use plastic contribute 2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually – as much as commercial air travel. We will focus on the 19,500 restaurants in the county that are not part of a larger chain operation. To meet state mandated reductions in landfilled solid waste, our single-use consumption habits have to change. Restaurants have relied on plastic because of its weight and durability. That waste – used for an average of 15 minutes – spends 1,000 years breaking down into dangerous micro-plastics in a landfill or our environment. Recycling rates for paper, glass and metal are about 8X-10X higher than SUP because of their economic value. Helping users items identify sustainable swaps for their plastic will reduce our region's landfilled waste as well as the associated greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This proposal reflects a public activation campaign that has been deployed in a few instances already, so straddles the line between an evidence-based approach and an early stage program. We are near completion on a nine-month effort on behalf of the City of Palm Springs, whose city council enacted a stringent list of foodware restrictions in January 2022. We have collaborated with the city’s project leaders to contact all of the restaurant and hospitality operations within their jurisdiction at least three times to make them aware of the new restrictions, offer help in choosing replacements, and delivered a compliance and monitoring mechanism through our app at app.gojybe.com, where area diners can report on the types of materials they receive in their orders. City officials received a comprehensive list of all contacts and their results, and will now be able to utilize our user-generated reviews to monitor compliance, saving time in where they direct their inspectors.",

Our effort includes a multi-prong approach to reach our audience electronically and with on-site visits. We offer both self-guided resources to understand any applicable laws in their jurisdiction, pending regulation changes and useful tools to update their purchasing decisions. For restaurants that need more help, we provide one-on-one support to help with their sourcing of new materials. Oftentimes a restaurant will provide a copy of their latest supplier invoices and have us suggest smarter replacements based on the specs. Other times we provide leads on where their own buyers can look for alternatives. All of the contacts we make, whether for self-directed help or our direct assistance, are logged and followed up so there is total transparency. If budget allows, we like to make samples of commonly used materials available to the restaurants to try out at no charge. We find this greatly enhances adoption and is a fair offer to make to smaller restaurants. There is no question that hospitality businesses will eventually have to adopt more sustainable materials. Helping these small businesses make smart choices to transition to better products is good for everyone.",

Dodgers Dreamfields, LADF’s longest-standing program, builds and refurbishes baseball and softball fields to give families across Los Angeles a safe place to gather, improving access to vibrant, safe parks in limited-income communities. Joining LADF’s 58 already existing Dodgers Dreamfields, our goal to achieve 75 by 75 is about bringing together families, volunteers, recreation departments, nonprofit organizations, advocates, resources, and donors in a big way, to create the ultimate dreamteam to ensure youth in under resourced communities have access to high-quality park space in their neighborhoods. Dodgers Dreamfields are game-changers, revitalizing green spaces to help re-energize the community’s use of parks, creating a renewed sense of belonging for local neighbors, especially after the pandemic. With Green Space, Park Access, Trees, and Community Safety being some of the highest-priority areas for Angelenos, we believe now is an opportune time to partner with LA2050 and the LA2050 community to ensure communities across Los Angeles will live in close proximity to vibrant, safe parks and have access to high-quality, sustainable open spaces for recreation by 2050.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "LA County Department of Parks and Recreation has just 11 fields per 100,000 residents, whereas the national average is 14.6 fields.

Lack of park access in racially diverse communities prevents youth and families of color from being part of their own community. When youth of color do not have positive environments where they can learn, grow, and develop, they are at significant risk of participating in unhealthy life choices that diminish health outcomes over their lifetime. Along with stressors associated with limited-income communities, such as poor or unstable housing, food and income insecurity, inadequate schools, high crime and violence, the lack of park space for youth of color are racial justice and public health issues."

The first, by advancing the field through presentation of new or rarely heard music - FASO is known for being the only musical ensemble in North America that presents Filipino music in the genre of orchestra music. Second, by supporting artists' livelihoods and ongoingly engaging the contractual orchestra musicians, guest artists, and composers. FASO engages a widely diverse body of musicians and is uniquely positioned to present multiple voices and a cultural synthesis of musical traditions that reflect America.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Greater Los Angeles is home to 606,657 Filipinos (374,000 residing in LA County), the second-largest concentrated population of Filipinos in the world, surpassed only by Manila. Filipino Americans are described as \"invisible\" or “forgotten minority,” with cultural and historical narratives that are virtually unknown to the American public. This invisibility comes with a cost - a lack of resources as the community often gets overlooked and subsumed under Latino or Asian; susceptibility to being taken advantage of, a lack of political clout, and lately, becoming the target of Asian hate. This program will increase literacy by building skills in instrumental and vocal performances, and increase awareness about Filipino indigenous music and instruments; foster a larger sense of community belonging among diverse communities of color through musicmaking; and, nurture individual self-esteem and confidence as a person of color, and instill pride in one’s cultural identity.",

FASO continues to embrace, redefine and celebrate its multicultural musical legacy with its diverse body of musicians and participants from all walks of life, inclusive of individuals with disabilities. From the beginning, FASO programming/services are built around a community-engaged arts practice - \"an approach to art making and community building that fosters collaborative relationships between artists and community members.\" (source: Toronto Arts Foundation's Neighbourhood Arts Network). FASO focuses its equity work by increasing the visibility of this minority and help integrate this predominantly immigrant group into the larger Los Angeles civic and cultural discourse.",

Youth participants from FASO's music education workshops (instrumental and vocal) learn about traditional Filipino folk songs through performance and composition. FASO will continue to advance its cultural equity work by further exploring and developing pathways to actively serve and engage underserved youth in communities of color ongoingly, despite of the pandemic, through its music and education programs. Also, FASO provides performances and music education programs to a wide range of audiences, with specific emphasis on underserved communities of color all across Los Angeles County and surrounding areas. With its Education & Outreach program, FASO intends to provide a healthy and empowering identity context for BIPOC youth in place of a victim of race narrative. Additionally, FASO works in BIPOC communities throughout Los Angeles County - Historic Filipinotown (majority are Hispanic/Latinx), Carson (majority are African American), and Glendale (majority are Armenians and Hispanic/Latinx). Within the next year, FASO plans to extend its reach to the San Fernando Valley in the Panorama City/ Van Nuys area (majority are Hispanic/Latinx). FASO also recognized that the Equity work cannot be addressed on its own and consciously sought partnerships with schools, organizations, governments, and media companies, locally and internationally."

Our village safety net changed their lives because they had a sanctuary that gave them the tools and a strong support system to thrive. Our success is Los Angeles' and theirs too. For one, foster and system-impacted youth develop protective factors, such as, self-esteem, problem-solving and coping skills, academic development, and community connections to prepare them for life. They know that they don't have to face life alone and that resources in their home communities are a life support and safety net for them to fall back on when needed. Finally, they have agency to manage the physical and emotional difficulties; garner \"life lessons\"; practice financial wellness, prepare for careers, complete educational goals, and give back by being productive citizens. .",

We have a small core team with more than 200 volunteers (most are STEM professiols) who serve as mentors providing 1:1 mentorship for each Scholar. We partner with more than 50 companies, including Farmers, Accenture, Deloitte, and Sony Pictures Entertainment, to provide paid internships and entry-level jobs. Professiol and industry organizations include Southern California Society for Information Magement and Women in Technology Hollywood. Many partners support multiple aspects of our program and promote to their Employee Resource Groups for volunteers to be mentors.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "We “level the playing field” by empowering talented students, who are mostly low-income, first-generation college students, with access to networks, employment, and economic mobility. Our program benefits the student (“STEM Advantage Scholar”), their family and community resulting in a generational impact and a clear path to address the gender and racial wealth gaps. We selected California State University as our first university partner because the CSU is the largest and most ethnically diverse 4-year public university system in the nation. Our comprehensive program includes: •\tPaid internships to help students gain real-world experience •\t1-to-1 Mentors to provide a role model, support, guidance, and coaching •\tScholarships to attend classes full-time and graduate with less student debt •\tProfessional development and career panels to prepare for their job search, and •\tCommunity providing a sense of belonging, support, and opportunities to build their network. Scholars and alumni “Pay It Forward” as role models and mentors for younger students. If they can see it, they can be it! Our program extends beyond graduation supporting alumni with a network of corporate leaders and career development to help them advance in their careers and build wealth. Plus, our Freshmen STEM Career Pathways program engages first-year college students, especially women, Black and Latinx students, provides exposure to STEM career opportunities, and drives persistence in a STEM major."

As climate change impacts become ever more severe, it’s predicted that many parts of LA County will experience over 100 extreme heat days (defined as exceeding 95°F) each year. Already today many of our most vulnerable Angelenos face potential heat illness or even death from extreme heat exposure. Extreme heat exposure has also been linked to poorer student learning outcomes, as well as spikes in violent crimes. Bus shelters can protect transit riders from extreme heat exposure, yet cities neglect to invest in such basic transit amenities. Bus riders haven’t had an adequate platform to demand the provision of such infrastructure - until now.",

On top of that, jurisdictions will have a better knowledge of funding streams and how to better incorporate community priorities into their transportation infrastructure. What does that look like? It looks like an older Angeleno being able to wait comfortably for the bus, and having access to parts of town they wouldn’t have dared go before. Teens having a place to sit and chat. A thirsty middle schooler grabbing a drink while they wait for the bus to go home from practice. By proliferating community-designed spaces with benches, shade, hydration stations, and other amenities we can create a more nurturing environment for Angelenos, and spur community movements to carry that momentum even further.",

The TM technique involves no focused attention or open monitoring, making it unique in its ability to reduce Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. (Weill Cornell Medical Center - New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City) - where a pilot study of physicians found significant reductions in physician burnout, insomnia, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress over a three-month period practicing TM).

(2003); Askeland, I.R. & Heir, T. (2014); Hosie J., Gilbert F., Simpson K., & Daffern M. (2014)]. Stress and trauma experienced in childhood and adolescence contributes to risk factors associated with higher levels of violence and poor educational outcomes including low grades, suspensions and dropping out of school. Stress can cause, and often exacerbates impulsivity, anxiety, depression, anger, bullying, lack of motivation, low self- esteem, low self-control, ADHD, inability to think critically, and proclivity for substance abuse. Toxic stress activates the fight-or- flight response, causing the prefrontal cortex, responsible for judgment, decision-making, and impulse control, to be deactivated. Under conditions of chronic stress, the prefrontal cortex becomes smaller and less effective, which may contribute to violent behavior.",

    "summary": "ePAVE is a patented, reflective pavement coating material engineered to preserve asphalt and concrete while reducing climate change impacts. Compared to traditional paving materials, ePAVE lasts twice as long, cures 20 times faster and is non-toxic with no harmful emissions. This grant will provide means to address some of the challenges we face to fully roll out the product in market (i.e. how to keep the surface reflective from tire tracks to continue decreasing the heat on the surface and therefore decrease the greenhouse gas emission.)",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Reflective pavement coating is a relatively new industry. The industry is facing a major challenge to keep the surface or the pavement clean and free of debris and tire marks. At ePAVE, we have successfully developed a reflective pavement coating that addresses many challenges. However, we are still working on finding ways to keep the pavement surface free of debris. This grant will help us to engage the best in the industry to tackle this problem, reformulate it, produce the product, test it in the lab, test it in the field, do a few pilot project and eventually roll out. The reformulation could be done by using some admixtures. The surface free of debris will help ePAVE pavement coating to continue being reflective and keep the surface and the ambient air cool (up to 20 degrees). This helps decrease the Urban heat Island and greenhouse gas emission.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The product needs to go through some changes by reformulation. A team of expert chemist could help us identify the changes. Then the product will be produced, tested in the lab, tested in the field, piloted to early users and then rolled out to public.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "When ePAVE is used on the surface of pavements, it helps decrease the heat on the surface of the pavement and the ambient air. Neighborhoods in LA County that suffer the most from Urban Heat Island, and especially low income neighborhoods that don't have access to trees and air-conditioning will greatly benefit from cooler air once ePAVE is used. ePAVE also is non petroleum and non-toxic. Asphalt emanates twenty eight different chemicals to the environment. Once ePAVE is applied on a surface of asphalt that is toxic, it will cap the toxic emission further supporting the clean air. Los Angeles County will greatly benefit from this technology by having a cooler and cleaner air.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We measure the heat on the surface and the ambient air by a hand thermometer on all our pilot projects. The data collected is entered in a spreadsheet and compared to a surface with no ePAVE coating. The collected data shows us the direct impact of ePAVE on the heat reduction . There are also independent labs that could measure the Solar Reflectivity of the surface with a special equipment. Also, thermal imaging could be done on those surfaces to show how much impact the ePAVE surface could have on decreasing heat on those surface. Thermal images that is done by NASA/JPL shows how cool pavements like ePAVE decrease the heat on the surface on the surface and what effect they have on the surrounding buildings. These satellite images could be requested to define and measure success.",

At the height of the pandemic, Casa 0101 fully embraced the transition to virtual programming. This was especially true in the case of its youth programs. After over a year of virtual programming, the youth were ready to come back for in-person programming. After securing dedicated funding, Casa 0101 was able to launch its first Youth on-camera Acting program. The idea behind the class was to consolidate all of the youth arts programs into a single overarching project that would showcase each class through a short film production. It would be youth-led and supported by BIPOC industry professionals, who would provide guidance and mentorship. The project took on the form of a short film that was written in the youth screenwriting classes, the performers were from the youth dance and acting programs, and the crew members were a collective of youth from both classes and other local youth interested in working behind the scenes. Casa 0101 dedicated its main stage for this program over the next 3 months and the youth participated in every facet of the production of this short film. The completed film, The Train, was accepted into the LA Skins Film Festival premiering that Fall at the historic Chinese Theater in Hollywood. Casa 0101 is looking to bring this program back again.",

When Casa 0101 was founded over 20 years ago, the perception of the community of Boyle Heights was oftentimes characterized as dangerous and blighted. News reports were almost exclusively about gangs and crime, while completely neglecting the art, culture and history of the community. This view has continued in large part, while simultaneously being seen as desirable for its proximity to downtown LA and its cultural authenticity. This has led to real threats of gentrification and displacement. With the success of our work, Los Angeles County will be different because there will be a generation of youth who take pride in their community. They will find agency by being the protagonists of their own stories. They will be the ones who rewrite the narrative of Boyle Heights as a community rich in arts and culture. And they will be the ones who protect its history and identity.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We measure the impact of our work in the countless testimonies of youth from our community, many who faced severe challenges, that have benefited from our programs. Some have gone on to pursue careers in the arts and have established themselves in the industry, others have gone on to pursue careers that are not directly arts-related but have experienced the many benefits of having been exposed to the arts. We have found that many of the youth are very happy to tell their stories and share how Casa 0101 has positively impacted them (see video link below). Quantitatively, Casa 0101 sends surveys to all participants at the end of its classes and productions to measure the impact of the programs and seek ways to improve. Additionally, Casa 0101 is able to measure the impact of its programs through its theatrical productions. Many participants in Casa 0101's educational programs, whether as writers, performers or crew, find their first real stage credits on Casa 0101's stage.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We understand that both issues, Access to Creative Industry Employment and Income Inequality, are interwoven and issues that Casa 0101 has addressed for many years. This work began in 2000 in a small converted bridal shop in an historically underserved community. The early years of Casa 0101 were focused on presenting theatrical productions that were for and about the community: they were stories that focused on the experiences of the working-class, primarily immigrant, community of Boyle Heights and were written by and featured BIPOC artists in roles that showcased them as the protagonists of their own stories. Over the next 20 years, this ethos of equity and representation has grown to create a pipeline to the creative arts economy for many local youth and aspiring artists. This was done primarily through its free arts education programs that were originally focused on performance arts, but have since been expanded to prepare youth for all aspects of creative work.",

WHS has a Digital Media Arts (DMA) pathway and a schoolwide civic engagement curriculum called the Civic Action Project (CAP), offered through a partnership with Constitutional Rights Foundation. We will integrate these curricular elements into a 3-day per week STEAM after-school program with these key components: 1) ASAS-LA’s Life Service Action (LSA) program: Students will develop social responsibility and civic awareness through the design and execution of their own STEAM-focused community service projects. ASAS-LA staff will work with a regular day science teacher to develop a year-long STEAM service learning curriculum that allows students to apply what they are learning in their science classes to service learning projects that they design. 2) DMA training: Students will learn additional DMA skills as they work with ASAS-LA staff to create final project presentations. 3) Career Awareness: Students will go on field trips to local STEAM organizations to learn more about how the skills they are developing through their STEAM service learning projects align with potential STEAM careers.",

In the near-term, students will develop service learning projects that address STEM-related issues in the Southeast LA community, such as food justice projects to address the lack of healthy food options for families. Simultaneously, we will open students’ eyes to possible future STEM careers. STEM is a key driver of the CA economy, but the Black and Brown students that we serve are underrepresented in STEM fields. Latinx workers comprise 17% of the overall workforce but only 8% of the STEM workforce, with a similar level of underrepresentation across STEM fields. Black workers make up 11% of the workforce but only 9% of STEM jobs, with significant underrepresentation clustered in engineering (5%), life science (6%) and physical science (6%) (Pew Research Center, 2021).",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Over the short-term, the underserved Southeast LA area will be directly impacted by the students’ STEAM service learning projects. We cannot provide project specifics since students will determine their project focuses, but have found that environmental justice and food justice resonate with students so we anticipate projects related to those issues. Students will team up to develop projects; with an average of 4 team members there will be 10 projects. If each project touches an average of 100 community members, over the grant period 1,000 LA County residents will be positively impacted. Students will deepen understanding of how science learning connects to being a community change agent while gaining valuable foundational skills that enhance their career readiness and gaining insights into STEAM career pathways.

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Although LAPF and ASAS-LA have a long-standing partnership, the STEAM focus is new so there are no evaluation data to provide. Moving forward, our vision for success entails having students further develop foundational skills developed through CAP, by building intrapersonal, interpersonal and institutional skills that prepare them for STEAM careers and the work world overall. We will define and measure success through several key metrics tied to civic engagement, skill building and STEAM career awareness: On a student survey, at least 75% of students will report increases in: -understanding of unjust policies, practices or social norms that can be impacted through STEAM -critical thinking and problem solving skills -belief in their ability to effect change -ability to collaborate with other students and communicate effectively -sense of agency (CASEL SEL core competence: self-management) -awareness of STEAM career options -interest in pursuing a STEAM career",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our greatest marker of success comes from client stories as it paints a full picture of each survivor’s journey, rather than merely capturing statistics which can be helpful to understand the effect on a group but dilutes the impact on each community member, and their unique case. In one instance, a 67-year-old Korean woman sought escape from her abusive spouse. Our attorneys supported her by navigating legal processes for divorce, securing her immigration status, and applying for naturalization with a disability waiver for her dementia. In November 2021, she became a US citizen. In another, a client sent an inspiring message to our attorneys: “I wanted you to know that the work you do has made all the difference for me […] I can now raise my children with all the necessary tools, free of violence, and without the fear of deportation.

Our linguistically/culturally sensitive services extend a supporting hand to these clients in a way that recognizes the unique barriers they face, helping survivors build more rapport and trust with us and our resources – immigrants become more integrated into our communities when they experience intentionally mindful and inclusive support like this. Each case that we are successful in is one step closer to seeking justice for immigrant survivors; it opens the opportunity for them begin a new life and to begin thriving, rather than just surviving. It is then that they can begin to fully engage in society, and when that is possible, LA County becomes a safer and more hopeful place that they can call home.",

There is a significant shortage of AAPI language capacity legal aid in LA County, and although courthouses offer self-help services, service capacity is limited and inconsistent in AAPI languages despite having a substantial and growing AAPI population. To bridge this gap, Advancing Justice – LA is unique in providing the most AAPI languages (intake hotlines in Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, Vietnamese, and English; staff attorneys also have Spanish, Punjabi, and Armenian fluency to accommodate other populations in the region). The integration of immigration and family law services allows us to serve a niche set of immigrants who have been survivors of domestic violence, sexual abuse, and trafficking, to name a few. The complexity of these types of cases requires a comprehensive service delivery model that spans court assistance, legal representation, in-depth assessment and explanation to survivors about family law and immigration remedies, community outreach to allay survivors’ fears, and general education for public awareness. Our strong interdepartmental and interagency referral network ensures that our clients not only have access to legal services, but also to resources that will empower and support them in their journey to new beginnings.",

This can make starting a new and safe beginning seem distant and unachievable for them. Isolated by language and culture, with limited job skills and little knowledge of their rights, immigrant survivors often fall into a cycle of violence. According to a 2020 report, an upper rate of 55% of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women report experiencing violence during their lifetime, as well as barriers to seeking help with language, immigration status, and unavailability of services as the top reasons. Compared to other groups, this population was less likely to have an opportunity to obtain needed support, including help staying in the community safely (64% with access compared to 83% of other racial groups) and help with court cases against abuse perpetrators (38% vs. 80%)."

As demand for housing has increased in our region, the percentage of California’s housing stock in wildfire-prone areas has increased exponentially as urban sprawl has pushed more people out from job centers in search of more affordable homes. Unfortunately, Angelenos who bear the greatest burden of climate change are also most likely to be excluded from housing decisions. In today’s climate paradigm, a new American dream is necessary for Los Angeles when it comes to housing. Protecting residents from the consequences of climate change and reducing our carbon footprint as a County is imperative. To achieve that, Abundant Housing LA is reshaping housing narratives and training Angelenos to advocate for climate-resilient housing change.",

As a result of this effort, our local chapter members, local climate activists, and local policymakers will advance policy solutions that address LA’s climate and housing needs at the same time. To date, there has been little effort in LA to engage the public and local decision-makers in discussions and planning at the intersection of our two most urgent needs: housing and climate resilience. Angelenos are paying greater attention to housing as a result of the homelessness crisis, and housing also needs to be understood as an intersectional issue with a climate lens or else we are at risk of promoting change that harms our environment further. The Climate Ready Neighborhoods project will connect these issues and advance solutions to keep LA's housing future safe from the harmful effects of climate change."

In line with this abysmal statistic, only 13% of SLA residents possess a Bachelor's Degree as compared to 36% in Ls County. What this depicts is that high levels of poverty and low educational attainment are typically inherited. Minority women in South LA are uniquely impacted because they also bear the responsibility of managing children and home life. Employment opportunities in South LA for women include low-wage service jobs that often pay \"under the table.\" For minority women who do not speak English opportunities are especially limited. This is a gross injustice for women in South LA. Even though they may have the skills, talent, and ideas to accomplish professional feats, their opportunities are limited.

As an overlay, women deserve to accomplish their professional goals and have a healthy, balanced home life. Women are capable business leaders, groundbreaking researchers, and solid contributors to the workforce. As such, their skills will be nurtured with VSEDC's program tailored for women. Unfortunately, many women currently occupy low-wage service jobs with little or no room to grow or break through. Our work will impact women throughout Southern California by preparing a larger talent pool to perform its jobs, especially at the heels of the 2028 Olympics that will see a significant surge of contract jobs in the region."

With more than 450 active gangs in LA and a combined membership of 45,000, these system-involved youth are at significantly higher risk of offending and reoffending when re-entering their communities from correctional or residential facilities. This risk has only deepened due to inconsistent access to in-person support for school age students. While the LA Unified School District is back to in-person education, arts, career-support, academic enrichment, athletic, and other extracurricular programs remain inconsistent due to the pandemic, a risk factor to gang-involvement. Without intervention, these justice-impacted youth will continue to face these barriers to education and employment as well as the trauma of system-involvement and exposure to gang life and violence that impact their ability to thrive as adults.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Given that 25% Homeboy Industries' constituents have historically been 14-21 years old, we recognized the need to focus intentionally on juvenile reentry and launched the Youth Reentry Center in 2020. Annually, the Boyle Heights-based center provides 250 youth participants with support and resources related to education, employment, housing, basic needs, legal support, and others, in a cohort-based 12-month program. An integral component of our youth programming, the Homeboy Art Academy, provides community-based art programs that inspire hope, provide a commitment to transformation, and cultivate resiliency through a unique, culturally competent approach. The Art Academy’s work is strongly aligned to the Youth Reentry Center’s overarching goal to reduce recidivism among youth and young adults by providing opportunities for healing and access to the creative economy. The Youth Reentry Center reaches some of the hardest to engage youth in LA County. Due to the high density of gangs, many of our participants have been directly exposed to gangs by family members, friends, and members of their community. Youth in our community look to gangs as a place where they can feel seen and safe. We offer something else. For 34 years, Homeboy Industries has modeled an alternative to the revolving door of gang-involvement and incarceration in LA by offering a healing place for system-involved Angelenos to be seen for the first time, shifting the way they see themselves in the world.",

Homeboy Industries began tracking postsecondary education and employment following graduating from the Youth Reentry Center in 2020; thus, we currently have two years of data to report on for this metric. Among Youth Reentry Center participants, the vast majority did not recidivate nor have recidivated, and only 17% (or 27 out of 157) have been incarcerated at any time since their enrollment date. Homeboy Industries continues to refine how we evaluate our youth programming. Our Chief of Research Evaluation & Strategy and on-staff Data Analyst oversee our evaluation of our outcomes on a quarterly and annual basis, including participant high school graduation rates and 12-month Reentry program impact results, among others.

Through tailored service plans, our programming helps end the generational cycle of violence and incarceration for young Angelenos. Our success is most clearly seen in stories like David’s. When David was released from a Camp Community Placement, he returned home to find his mother in a nursing home and his father in the hospital. David was referred to the Youth Reentry Center and, after expressing an interest in workforce development, began job training at Homeboy Electronics Recycling (HBR).

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Through our outreach team and community partners, we connect with families that are living in their vehicles and even camping tents. Funding would support our 90-Day Emergency Shelter program. This is the inspiration for the organization as it provides unsheltered households with safe, secure overnight shelter off of the street, access to laundry & shower facilities, and the opportunity to meet with case managers on a daily basis. Although we serve all family configurations, a great number of our clients are single parents (87%), this includes veterans and single fathers, some of those families are fleeing domestic violence situations (34%). In addition to temporary shelter and in an effort to meet the growing needs of our community, Home Again LA (HALA) provides households with intensive counseling and case management, housing advocacy, financial literacy workshops, employment resources, rental assistance, and finally transitional housing with the ultimate goal of permanent housing. The most difficult part of climbing out of homelessness is generating enough income to save for the initial costs of securing housing, as most landlords require salaries to be at least 3x the rent amount. Removing that hurdle and advocating for our clients by providing cash payments directly to landlords with the help of this grant, would ensure our families are given an equal opportunity to secure and retain employment for at least 6 months and succeed despite their previous setbacks.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "HALA uses pre-surveys that include a family's vision of success and what that means to them.

The 90-Day Shelter program was created with major benchmarks in mind and the amount of time it takes to achieve said benchmarks such as the date employment is secured, and the date housing is secured. Each family member works 1:1 with a case manager, developing a strategic plan to return to work, locate affordable housing and increase household income. We use an internal software to track enrollment dates and growth of household income. When families exit the program, they receive one year of supportive services. We are proud of the results of our hard work & our commitment to bringing families home again: In 2020 185 families received access to shelter and supportive services; 175 remain housed In 2021 282 families received access to shelter and supportive services; 275 remained housed to-date",

We believe the opportunity for a more stable community becomes greater with self-sufficient households contributing to our economy. We are dedicated to helping families in need by offering one year of supportive services after exiting the program, allowing households to become financially independent and confident in their own ability to support their families. By continuing to offer these services, we help Los Angeles County thrive with more community members returning to the workforce, and more children enrolled in school, enabling families to escape the cycle of poverty and remain together as one household, therefore decreasing homelessness in LA County overall.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Due to the COVID19 pandemic, we have witnessed an increase in homelessness since the eviction moratorium was lifted. Many still owe back rent due to loss of employment and income. This has made securing permanent housing a great obstacle for those households that are not chronically homeless but solid family units that are trapped living on the streets or couch surfing due to no fault of their own. There are hundreds of once hard-working community members, now arms-length from barely sustainable human basics such as rent, gas, and groceries. Thinking of homelessness, we typically call to mind a single person, suffering from a substance disorder or mental health challenges. That is chronic homelessness. We rarely envision the difficulties families face when living paycheck-to-paycheck, but an unforeseen medical bill, car repair, or employment termination can quickly lead to eviction, then living in your vehicle. It really is that simple."

The average American youth that grows up in a biological family home will either live at home or receive support/resources until the age of 27. In contrast, foster youth without family to lean on are sent into the world at the age of 18 or 21 without the resources or networks needed to thrive. Without proper support, 24% of foster youth graduate high school, only 3% graduate from college, and 20% experience homelessness upon emancipation. These conditions are further exacerbated by COVID-19. The Field Center for Children’s Policy, Practice & Research reports that 7% of youth ages 18-23 were without shelter, 55% reported food insecurity, and 31% lost access to academic support due to the pandemic. Foster Nation exists to bridge the gap in the transition from foster care.",

Our pre-, mid- and post-program surveys measure content retention and program effectiveness. Our evaluation will measure the extent to which foster youth: 1) feel confident in achieving their career goals using CareerX lessons and resources; 2) understand their personal finances (i.e., credit score, ability to file their own taxes); 3) can competently access and organize important documents (i.e. state ID, work identification, voter registration); 4) feel confident in their ability to access public/private benefits; 5) feel equipped to set meaningful and attainable personal/professional goals; and 6) develop soft skills (i.e., time management, responsibility).

Now there are almost 40,000 youth in foster care in L.A. County, the largest of any county in the nation. Approximately 10% age-out of foster care annually. “Aging out” means that a youth will no longer have their needs met by the state and must quickly become self-sufficient – identify and maintain housing, find a job, and manage their own finances. Within 18 months of emancipation, about half will become homeless and one-quarter will be incarcerated. A lack of basic home furnishings is one of the factors that causes homelessness or housing instability for transition aged youth. “Furniture poverty” is the inability to access or afford furniture or home goods that are essential to achieving the most basic standard of living.

Yet, 10% of households in Los Angeles are food insecure. Throwing food and carbon-based organics into landfills not only squanders water and energy, it releases potent greenhouse emissions that fuel Los Angeles’ rising temperatures, drought and wildfire emergencies. Facing disproportionate food and climate impacts are Los Angeles County’s densely populated, low income and Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) communities, made vulnerable from historic disinvestment, environmental racism and food apartheid. Even as municipal and commercial waste haulers mobilize to meet federal and state food waste reduction requirements, their large-scale systems alone cannot foster community restoration of food systems, green spaces, and human connections to the land, soil, and one another.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "During this grant period LA Compost will engage over 2,000 volunteers around compost and providing 6,000+ hours of direct climate action, facilitate 30 accessible community education and engagement events reaching over 500 residents, divert over 1.3 million pounds of organics from landfill, generate over 130,000 pounds of local compost amendment for urban food production and green spaces, and provide compost access to 6,000 individuals. Long-term, our work will continue to promote food and environmental justice through climate action. We will continue to invest in neighborhood beautification and a green workforce, increase organics diversion from landfill and reduce large scale truck hauling within neighborhoods. Our compost production will continue to restore living soil ecosystems through fostering microbial, fungal and insect diversity, increase soils’ carbon, air, nutrient and water-holding capacity, and provide healthy food access within LA’s most food insecure communities.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Educational workshops include garden demonstrations and community compost turning events. These events are key as they ensure community members have a heightened understanding of their current waste system, where organics are either sent to landfill, exacerbating greenhouse gas emissions, or are driven 70 miles outside city lines for anaerobic digestion, removing them as a community resource. Volunteer opportunities allow individuals to compost, gain environmental understanding and outreach during farmers’ markets and other events. Programs include our Community Compost Coaching Program to provide technical assistance for communities seeking composting, food waste reduction and soil stewardship efforts in their neighborhoods, and Soil Farmer Program to support the leadership of South Los Angeles residents to improve their local green spaces. Food waste diversion services include our Farmers’ Market Drop-off and broader Community Partner Drop-off services for individuals to divert kitchen organics at farmers’ markets, and other community locations, Community Hub Program for households to divert kitchen organics, fuel composting and food production at community gardens, and Regional Compost Hubs which utilizes public parks and urban farms to process large volumes of organics into compost.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "A SEED school addresses two key opportunities in LA. Resilient youth served by LA County need an educational model with enhanced services not currently available in traditional schools. Concurrently, LA Metro estimate more than 778,000 new jobs over the next 40 years. There are limited options for underrepresented youth to connect and prepare for the jobs. LA County provides welfare services for nearly 36,000 youth and supervises approximately 10,000 youth through the Probation Department. LA County has determined these youth could benefit from an enhanced academic model that includes educational enrichment and intensive social services to attain a degree and career. In South LA 7% of local high school students are performing at grade level in math and 25-30% are at grade level in language arts. 58% of young people in foster care graduate from high school and only 3% from college. More staggering, 50% of young adults who age out of foster care end up homeless or incarcerated."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Over the last 10 years, Film and Television production increased over 300% with no shift in hiring practices, but while increasing diversity above the line has been a focus, there have been no increases in diversity within below-the-line programs. 95% of industry jobs are the technical behind the camera, but BIPOC editors comprise only 5.7% of editors. The Motion Picture Editors Guild estimates less than 2.5% of union members are African American. We believe that if more youth of color have the right technical and soft skills training and develop key professional networks, which are critical to accessing job opportunities, they can secure postproduction employment. Another challenge we address is that film schools do not train for the skills used in Television. 95% of television programming is edited on Avid systems, while most schools teach on Adobe platforms. That’s why we use Avid systems and industry-trained instructors in our training and pre-employment programs.",

We will target newcomers seeking a new career path and candidates must demonstrate basic proficiency in an editing platform to enter Phase 1. Phase 1 [4 months]: Using social media, community partners, we will recruit and assess 30 youth for phase 1. Youth receive state-of-the art software instruction from working industry experts, and soft skills from staff to determine their proficiency to enter advanced training. Phase 2 [4 months]: Participants learn advanced software skills key to tv/film postproduction jobs: 1. Unscripted, scripted and applicable remote workflows. 2. Media/project management. 3. Technical training taught on professional edit platforms. 4. Practice drills and mock interviews to prepare trainees for real world experience. 5. Job readiness soft skills essential for placement with partner companies as assistant editors and/or story producers. 6. Trainees are carefully evaluated by instructors before job search and placement. Phase 3 [4 months] Placement includes networking with employers who have committed to hire graduates, interviews with employers, and post-placement mentoring and support to ensure job retention.",

They will also have access to paid internships with production companies where they will apply skills learned in training as a path to employment. Participants also learn soft skills-communication, conflict resolution, resume/portfolio preparation and interviewing-that increase the likelihood of employment and retention. Our past successes indicate that beyond employment and economic benefits to participants and employers, the community will experience a greater sense of pride, increased family stability and a reduction of involvement in the judicial system which presents greater risk for unemployed youth."

When Union Pacific Railroad left in the 1980s, the land was left with decades of contamination. The soil is polluted with lead and other toxins that spread to surrounding neighborhoods through wind, stormwater runoff, and eventually groundwater. As climate change intensifies storms and flooding, these issues will only worsen. The site has been identified for extensive wetland restoration, an effort that requires full remediation. The ultimate benefit: healthy soils and habitats that sequester carbon and cool temperatures. The community is also concerned about the dust caused by the movement of contaminated soil and the City of Los Angeles is concerned about the astronomical cost of full remediation using traditional methods. Phytoremediation is the most cost-effective, low-impact solution to meet this community need.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If successful, this project will make a significant impact on Los Angeles County and set a statewide precedent for nature-based soil remediation practices. Currently, DTSC relies on expensive and environmentally destructive soil excavation practices or caps land with concrete, which entombs the contamination, leaving it to seep into our waters. This project could be groundbreaking for public health and for working soils that can sequester carbon. It also has the potential to make a significant case for cost effective, low-impact remediation of toxic lands in urban environments. In the short-term, the project will connect youth to STEM careers and the community to the potential of a healthy environment. Residents will also increase their knowledge of environmental education and engagement with nature.

This project will test the efficacy of phytoremediation on one-riverfront-acre of Taylor Yard G2 and will use this effort to connect local communities to an otherwise inaccessible issue and property. The project will evoke the public’s imagination and make visible what is possible on this fallow land. What makes this project unique is the use of native plants and fungi to extract site contaminants. Plants and fungi have the natural ability to filter toxins directly from the soil and this project will test their ability to remove harmful toxins, including lead and other heavy metals, from the soil. If proven effective, phytoremediation can then be applied to the remaining 41 acres of Taylor Yard G2. The project will be conducted from 2022 to 2024, and project activities include: plantings, collecting soil samples, providing regulatory updates, workforce development for 10 local youth in phytoremediation, hazardous substances, and science communications, as well as public multi-modal public engagement (digital, onsite signage, events). By the end of the project we will have engaged community members and youth on the possibilities and importance of soil health, nature-based solutions, and their power to advocate.

A client file is created for each student using the completed forms in their enrollment packets along with attendance data and report cards from the school. Students who withdraw are asked to complete the CBM CARES Posttest survey. At the end of the school year, every student completes the Posttest survey. Another measure of CARES impact and success is more parent and school staff engagement with project facilitator. We will continue to fine tune our program assessment tools to develop benchmarks and indicators that more definitively show progress on achieving student learning outcomes and measuring program effectiveness, particularly, digital skill learning outcomes."

We are an intervention program that helps youth deal with their anger challenges in a healthier, more prosocial way. Our goal with them participating in our various programs is to become high functioning members of society and to contribute to this growing and thriving city. Many of our youth and young adults use their story to help others like them, become public policy change advocates in local, state and federal campaigns, go to school to become social workers or other chosen fields. We are giving youth a second, third, fourth, and even fifth chance to become the best version of themselves and productive and contributing citizens in their communities.",

We are one of the first programs to be offered inside LA County’s juvenile hall. Weekly classes are conducted by Teaching Artists in a trauma-informed, strengths-based curriculum, focused on positive youth development, and promote resilience and healing in a culturally responsive way. Classes are reflective in nature and focus on the youth’s past, present, and future and encourage original writing that helps them speak their truths in authentic ways. The Teaching Artist also serves as a positive role model and mentor and assists with transitioning from Juvenile Hall to IOW. We find that youth with severe trauma, neglect, and other ACEs related issues benefit from our classes since it allows them to be vulnerable and learn positive ways to advocate and express themselves. Our Alumni Program provides holistic re-entry services for youth returning home from incarceration. We provide counseling, mentorship, workforce development, academic re-engagement, field trips, and other services as well. Additionally, we provide at-risk youth diversion services that includes: school-related goals, civic engagement, social justice, behavioral health, recreational activities, creative writing, and work-related placement.",

Youth who come into contact with the justice system or are at risk for arrest and incarceration in Los Angeles County face numerous challenges, including educational disengagement, social isolation, unemployment, homelessness, and complex medical health and/or behavioral/mental health conditions. Leading research on adolescent brain development and effective interventions for Youth highlights the importance of holistic, developmentally appropriate, trauma-responsive, community-based programming that is designed to respond to the strengths, interests, and experiences of each Youth. Our 3-decades of experience has allowed us to obtain first-hand knowledge on how to work with this population and work with their various traumas. These youth experience higher rates of high school dropouts, increased suicide, substance abuse, chronic disease, gang involvement, shorter lifespans, and other negative outcomes.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our Writing Program inside the Juvenile Halls is currently servicing around 170+ youth. We know our program works because of the number of participants, since our program is purely voluntary for them to attend. Furthermore, the quality of their improved writings, and their desire to have their writings published in our quarterly InDepth Journal are just a few examples of the measure of success. We host an annual Writers’ Retreat, which provides youth an environment to showcase their original writings. Additionally, youth fill out a Pre/Post Survey that provides insights on whether their needs and services have been met. Moreover, each youth is provided with an Individualized Action Plan that includes their goals for completing high school and advancing to college."

Annenberg Institute confirms the problem: “Hollywood movies perpetuate a lack of inclusive representation of those from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, girls and women, the LGBTQ community, and individuals with disabilities.” In Variety, Dave McNary wrote, “Men comprised 68% and women 32% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on films in festivals in 2018-19.” He added that on films directed by women 72% of writers and 45% of editors were women as opposed to 11% & 21% on male directed films. To end the gross underrepresentation, we train and support youth early in order to penetrate the odds that are stacked against them.

As future content leaders these underrepresented students will gain access to industry jobs, inspire more girls, shape the stories told and help define our culture. To attain equity, we include diverse groups of girls and non-binary youth ages 12-18 and provide financial hardship scholarships. Our workshops and 3-week summer film intensive are taught by top professionals, some Emmy-winning, who volunteer in all areas of production providing crucial training. Students form groups in a safe, virtual, collaborative environment and use smart phones and cutting-edge tools to create festival-ready films that are screened at our virtual global festival. This underserved demographic gains exposure and participates in a Q&A with the audience. Many of our alumni are currently studying film at top universities and most serve on our Youth Advisory Board, which is open to all alumni and serve as mentors and producers along with our Board of Directors creating networking opportunities at an early age. Using skills learned during our 3-week intensive and our teacher training, several alumni, including one from Mexico will be teaching film classes for and funded by our partnership with LAUSD Steam Collective enrichment program (LAUSD SCEP)."

School children are less active than any previous generation, in part because they are walking and biking to school less (18% now compared to 50% in 1970) with more cars going to school sites every day. As a result, obesity and heart-related health issues continue to rise, while traffic and traffic safety continue to worsen, especially at school sites. Additionally, low income Latinx, Black and immigrant youth have less access to secondary education and employment options due to limited access and expense. Unfortunately, a lack of local, affordable resources is a barrier to a simple solution for low income families: bicycles. A lack of access to bicycles means limited opportunities for transit, recreation and employment. This also results in less opportunities for kids to be active outside, explore their independence and develop responsibility, problem solving skills and community awareness.",

We will also track their financial trajectories, e.g. investments raised for their production companies and the size of deals they secure, to the extent they feel comfortable sharing.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 1,060",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "To address this disparity, WIF will program educational workshops to build confidence and competency for female and gender expansive business owners in the screen industries. WIF will host 6-8 digital sessions to expand financial literacy, covering topics like: -how to structure and ask for capital -running your business as a freelancer -creating networking roadmaps and connecting with potential financiers Through these trainings, early and mid career professionals will gain the skills and confidence to secure their existing businesses, pursue entrepreneurial endeavors and win new sources of funding. Through education we aim to confront the risk-factor associated with entrepreneurship that often keeps women on the sidelines. Half of the sessions will be targeted to the 74 WIF Fellows who are selected to receive intensive mentorship from WIF each year. These female and nonbinary creatives are majority people of color from all backgrounds and abilities, across various roles including writers, directors, producers, editors, and cinematographers. Half of the sessions will be open to the public and reach a wide audience of diverse female and nonbinary screen industry entrepreneurs. This will be WIF’s first initiative addressing the study’s findings under a new banner of programming called Entrepreneurial Pathways. Additional programs will follow to combat the disparate distribution of capital and address the other three barriers identified in our research.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In 2021 WIF commissioned a first-of-its-kind study by Alicia Jessop (Pepperdine Univ) looking into the experiences of female screen industry entrepreneurs when accessing capital. It was inspired by the experiences of WIF board members who despite their vast successes each could not secure outside funding for her entrepreneurial endeavor. The study found that on average, men-owned screen industry businesses receive SEVEN times more funding than those owned by women. It identified four barriers women face that contribute to this outcome, including a lack of self-confidence in their own abilities to structure financing, compete for funding and ask for the capital they need. Women entrepreneurs need resources to come equipped to the negotiating table, win funding, and shift power dynamics in the screen industries. Hollywood is a creative industry driven by financial capital; true gender equity will only be achieved once both the creative and economic sides of the equation are addressed.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "WIF is a fifty-year-old organization with deep ties to the diverse communities of Los Angeles. Our ultimate goal is an entertainment industry that reflects the population in front of and behind the camera. This program will shift the distribution of money and power in one of Los Angeles’ largest industries so that historically underrepresented people have equal access to funding, capital, investment and in turn, opportunity. If we are successful, Los Angeles will boast the nation’s largest and most diverse screen industry workforce. The sector will reflect an inclusive and equitable distribution of capital. More women and gender expansive people, in particular people of color, will own a percentage of businesses in the screen industries. Barriers that have historically kept women from starting their own businesses will crumble, as the Los Angeles’ business community will encourage expansive investment for women and nonbinary people, in turn promoting creative and economic prosperity.",

Our approach provides hardcore street-based mediation to stop or prevent violence between gangs and the concurrent redirection of individual gang members and their families to improve lives. The first prong requires Resilient to use our trained Community Intervention Worker (CIW) to implement strategies that maintain peace between rival gangs, develop local and regional truces, defuse rumors, and provide crisis response and safe passages in the community and schools. The program will cover the areas from Washington south to Florence, and from the 110 freeway East to Alameda. Resilient is highly qualified to do this work because of our credibility and strong License to Operate in these communities and our past effectiveness in being able to engage the most violent and those at risk of causing harm. A License to Operate (LTO) is integral to effective community violence intervention. CIWs earn their LTO by establishing trust within the communities they serve and acting as credible messengers to cool tensions. Often, CIWs earn their LTO through lived experience and training in intervention. Because of their personal connection to the work combined with the knowledge of best practices, they are the most successful at guiding individuals to reach ceasefires and create non-aggression agreements that curb violence and allow for peace.",

Our goal is to connect 150 gang-involved and justice-impacted youth to support services where they will gain employment and the life skills needed to maintain employment and ensure positive outcomes. Successful implementation will lead to a reduction in violent crime and shootings, the creation of safe passages for youth to get to and from school, and an overall increase in feelings of safety. Resilient will leverage our LTO as credible messengers and community leaders to engage those who are prone to cause harm and stop violence at the root. Families of gang-involved individuals are often close to the occurring conflicts, which leads to an abundance of needs. Resilient will build relationships with families and offer resources such as PPE, food banks, and other services to provide an umbrella of community safety.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Resilient measures and reports our impact with success stories, participant case notes, and monthly documentation reports, as well as measuring the number of contacts and services case managers provide for each participant until program completion. When a youth or participant is referred to Resilient, a baseline assessment is administered to identify needs, strengths, barriers, risk factors, and a plan of action for short-term and long-term goals. The participant completes an assessment at the 6-month mark and 1-year mark to assess if behavioral risk factors are reduced, barriers removed, and strengths enhanced. Resilient’s leader has managed LA City and Mayor’s Office of Gang Reduction & Youth Development (GRYD) contracts since 2007, with extensive experience managing database requirements for LA County’s Community Health Worker Outreach Initiative. We plan to continue strategic documentation and reporting to ensure the effectiveness and our programs and identify areas for growth.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "As an organization, Resilient has four years of experience in the field of community violence intervention, contributing to the decrease in violent crimes in Los Angeles. We have provided case management for 300 gang-involved and at-risk youth with an 85% success rate of participants graduating the program in the areas of South LA and Echo Park. Resilient is passionate about community violence intervention because we understand that a lack of effective safety in communities contributes to the rise in gun violence. For example, since the onset of the pandemic, violent crimes have steadily risen in Los Angeles by 31% bringing the total number of murders in Los Angeles to 397. Of those who passed on, 47% were Hispanic and 37% were African American. Resilient's work as community interventionists allows us to keep the pulse of the community by utilizing our level of influence and established trust to reduce shootings, retaliatory efforts, and ultimately create local and regional truces.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Replate will address food waste through two meaningful approaches. We will reduce food waste by scaling our food recovery to serve a larger base of businesses. Second, we will develop our source reduction technology to proactively reduce the level of excess food generated. By recovering food waste and preventing food waste at the source, Replate will meaningfully reduce the amount of edible food sent to landfill, which will reduce pollution and improve the environment for Angelenos. Funding will support Replate’s expansion to serve a greater number of partners in our active markets. We are targeting to sign at least 100 new food donor businesses within LA in 12 months. Our goal is to deliver at least 800,000 meals annually through this program. From an environmental perspective, this target means we will divert at least 1,400 tons of CO2 emissions and save over 370 million gallons of water from being wasted on additional food production in 12 months. The funding will also support Replate’s unique source reduction technology. Replate’s platform tracks the sources of food waste from businesses and provides insights into reducing the amount of waste generated. For example, if a food donor consistently generates an excess supply of rice every week, Replate’s technology will highlight this trend so that the ordering team can begin reducing the volume of rice sourced to align with demand. In better managing resources, businesses are able to effectively reduce environmental harm.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Pursuing this mission has never been more important, as food waste is one of the largest instigators of the climate emergency. According to a study conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, “if food waste were a country, it would be the third largest emitting country [of greenhouse gases] in the world”. ReFED, a national nonprofit dedicated to ending food loss and waste across the U.S. food system, performed extensive research and found that in 2019, the U.S. let a huge 35% of the 229 million tons of food available go unsold or uneaten. And that uneaten food in the U.S. consumes 18% of all cropland use and 14% of all freshwater use. Given the size of subsequent environmental impacts, the U.S. government has set a 50% landfill diversion goal, that aims to cut the amount of food that goes into landfills and incineration in half by 2030.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Short term: Replate will build relationships and resources for LA businesses to better manage food supply. Tangibly, LAC will no longer send ~35% of food produced to landfills and in doing so, Angelenos will not be exposed to as many pollutants that deteriorate community health. Replate will support LAC’s implementation of SB1383 targeting reduced food waste. Long term: LAC’s food chain will be more resilient, with technology to connect surplus food. By improving the food supply chain, LAC will benefit from a more circular economy. Resources that would have been put towards landfills can be dedicated to communities. The ecosystem will be less strained for land, labor, water, fuel, and more; energy that would have been spent on additional production, transportation, and distribution of food will be conserved or dedicated to more impactful uses. When there is less extraction and overconsumption, the environment can heal and Angelenos will be able to live at their highest potential.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Replate’s impact measurement is inherently supported through our platform. We intentionally designed our technology and processes to capture data in order to quantify our community impact. We collect metrics on the type and volume of food. This data is translated into pounds of food rescued; using industry standard conversions we calculate the number of meals delivered, amount of water saved, and tons of CO2 emissions diverted from the environment. We’ve rescued over 3 million pounds of food, diverted 3.3 tons of CO2 emissions, and saved 900M+ gallons of water. Through this same data collection process, Replate will track and exhibit the trends in food donations over time so that businesses can empirically understand which sourcing practices generate waste. Thus, in addition to measuring the amount of harmful emissions that we divert from the environment to determine our success, Replate also will measure the reduction in the level of surplus food generated by businesses over time.",

Laundry, sweeping and cleaning of our spaces is an important aspect of preparing to one day possibly living outside of the family home. Art and music are a staple at GHR, many of our Ranchers do not verbally communicate and expression through art is a wonderful medium.

In addition, a lack of employment and employable skills exacerbates the cycle of domestic violence (DV) by limiting viable options for self-sufficiency.

Traditional high school systems leave behind students that need support. More than half of California’s Latinx high school graduates are not eligible for admission to the state’s public four-year university systems because they were not offered or supported to complete the A-G courses required (2021 State of Higher Education for Latinx Californians). An equal number of students face a variety of barriers, which have forced them out of traditional educational spaces and often leads to drug use and gang involvement for a lot of the youth in the target area; and as a result involvement in the criminal justice system. The program will recruit youth from the greater East Los Angeles area because of their historically distressed conditions, history of involvement with the juvenile justice system, high rates of arrest, high poverty rate, high rates of housing unstable youth and high dropout rates."

A grant from LA2050 will enhance our model by codifying our curriculum and aligning experiential learning opportunities in four career tracks. While other vocational programs focus on menial tasks, we use music as a vehicle for change. Music therapy is well-established as effective for children with ASD.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "An estimated 5.4 MILLION adults in the US have ASD. The CDC estimates CA is home to the largest population (701,669). Knowing that LA comprises 25% of CA’s population (2021 census), we estimate there are over 175,000 Angelenos with ASD. This population is growing. Each year, 50,000 teenagers with ASD across the nation turn 18 and age out of school-based services. Upon leaving school, there are few services available - ¼ receive no postsecondary services. Adults with ASD struggle with social interactions, making employment difficult. This renders over 90% unemployed or underemployed. Lack of employment leads to loneliness - adults with ASD are 4X more likely to experience loneliness than neurotypical adults. This means 10% or less of adults with ASD have a financially stable, meaningful life. COVID-19 has led to more unemployment and social isolation in the ASD and neurotypical community. Reflecting on how JHFA changed their life, one student said, “without JHFA I feel lonely.”",

Between 2020 and 2021, there was a 21% increase in the number of work opportunities. Additionally, there was a 125% increase in earnings. This program improves the lives of adults with ASD. One student commented, “JHFA has enriched my life for the better. It has given me the opportunity to express myself and opened doors for me to meet new people.” Another student commented that “JHFA helps me connect with the world.” Building on this success, JHFA will track the progress of the aforementioned goals. We use a combination of pre/ post-tests, teacher surveys (compiled into monthly reports and report cards every trimester), self-reported outcomes, audience reports, and employer surveys.

When we put this mechanism to an initial 6-month test in Miami, we saw participation from up to 50 youth per week from organizations like the Lotus House, the largest shelter for children in the United States. According to the Children’s Law Center of California, LA County has 33,000+ foster youth in care; meanwhile, only ~ 7,000 of them have direct access to resources like the Foster Youth Achievement Program (designed by LAUSD) that can effectively showcase the educational and therapeutic benefits of the arts – most specifically: dance.

We plan to recruit and train up to 25 local dancers, under the age of 25 and actively seeking employment, to teach dance in community venues, including youth shelters, that we make accessible weekly to individuals under the age of 18 living in foster homes. This initiative is a pilot program that we are conducting in LA County after testing our model that democratized dance education for up to 50 foster youth per week for 6 months in Miami. This 9-month program will take place between December 2022 and August 2023. Dancers will be recruited in October 2022 and will be professionally trained to engage with youth in November of 2022 with the arts educator coursework provided by our training partners like Dancewave.org. We have selected an initial group of dance studio partners to support our program including the West Coast Dance Theater, MovEssential Studio, and Art Box.

If we achieve similar success in LA County, we will increase commitments to healthy lifestyles among foster youth and increase self-esteem and earning potential among dance instructors and students alike. Our Program Manager Felicia Amon will conduct the program evaluation by using a stakeholder approach. We will design a pre-test and post-test for youth participants to: (1) calculate enrollment in scholastic arts programs, (2) measure the number of mentor connections, and (3) quantify sentiments about healthy lifestyles and self-esteem. Our class registration dashboard will measure student attendance and Felicia will conduct semi-annual interviews in a longevity study to measure increases in earning potential."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Beat the Odds® (BTO) is an evidence-based, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive program that integrates activities from group drumming and group counseling to build core strengths via a positive youth development approach, unlike deficit models typical of published research. Unlike traditional arts programs, BTO emphasizes process and not performance. It includes a therapeutic dimension such as positive affirmations, emotional coping strategies, and guided interaction with rhythmic activities serving as a metaphor for life, followed by reflection and dialogue. Research has shown that reflection leads to greater reductions in physical and psychological indicators of stress, and it also makes learning more explicit – which is central to the most effective social-emotional learning interventions. BTO empowers educators, mental health, and other school personnel with tools for supporting student mental health—without the stigma of therapy. BTO is an eight-session program delivered weekly for 40 – 45 minutes, with an easy-to-follow scripted manual. The program serves a whole classroom of diverse students at a time and is sustainably designed for delivery by school personnel or others without musical experience. BTO can easily be adapted for any age group and also serves as an effective tool for community building with staff and families. This project will also train students to deliver the program in a mentorship model that we have found effective in school settings.",

We also saw decreases in behavior incidents across the board. In year 2 of the above project, we developed an adolescent version of BTO centered on addressing bulling and meanness, after surveying all students about their greatest concerns. We found a significant improvement in a composite index of all 5 social-emotional goals just after two sessions. Teachers have reported drumming to be impactful for students with self-regulation challenges (e.g., they stop throwing furniture when invited to drum with someone else). BTO increases classroom participation by students with disabilities or by those who are shy. Shared drumming experiences broaden social circles among neurodiverse populations.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Youth needs for social emotional support escalated during the pandemic and impacted their ability to learn in school, especially students with existing academic, health, economic, and/or racial disparities. As schools forge a path forward, investing in student support and helping them heal will be crucial. Shared creative arts experiences, such as drumming, offer organic opportunities to develop empathy, meaningful dialogue, and connection. Drumming enables non-verbal self-expression and engagement when speech is limited by stress, trauma, ability, language, or culture. Active music making engages large areas of the brain, which calms lower-brain stress reactivity and, in turn, enables upper-brain learning and constructive behavior. Moreover, rhythmic synchrony stimulates a reward center of the brain and leads to positive behavior toward others. It encourages positive risk taking and growth mindset development essential to learning, classroom participation, and academic performance.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "As Los Angeles County continues healing from the long-term impacts of the pandemic, increased social-emotional student success will have a ripple effect throughout the community: Kindergarteners sharing eagerly and listening raptly to one another’s stories of kindness towards others. A classroom of grieving students smiling and laughing for the first time in months, finding resilience in knowing there is something they can do to feel better. A music teacher witnessing a group of 6th graders stopping a bully with a stare, after discussion of the affirmation “I am special, I am valuable.” Students with disabilities being included. Middle school students becoming better friends with their classmates, feeling happier and more relaxed, and finding relief from their pain. Students stopping fighting with each other because “you don’t beat up a member of your group.” Each session with students opens their hearts, changes their lives, and gives them tools to live life by, now and in the future."

In addition to promoting positive behaviors and relationships, participation in these enriching activities provides meaningful educational, social, and developmental advancement. Despite the recognition of the importance of extracurricular involvement, the policies and practices within the child welfare system, including insufficient case planning, limited judicial and legal advocacy and lack of funding, have created barriers to youth access.

Happy Trails understands that the “extras” in life matter. We have designed our programming to help propel youth participants to succeed academically, personally, and professionally. Happy Trails for Kids champions our overnight camping program. Youth overwhelming report the positive impact overnight camp has on their lives, and how they are empowered by the experiences at camp – and taking those new skills and confidence with them long after camp ends. In addition to overnight camp, we offer a range of services and support to youth throughout the year A critical component of our programming model includes our staff structure. Connections to camp counselors, the majority of whom have had lived experience in foster care, create opportunities for campers to develop meaningful relationships with role models. Over 70% of our camp staff understand, first-hand, the challenges of growing up in the child welfare system. This insight not only strengthens the trust and connections developed between youth and counselors, but also contributes enormously to our programming approach and priorities.",

Classes are taught by world class, 1st generation African instructors using custom curriculum aligned with core standards. As well as in person instruction, we provide custom written materials and access to videos for practice outside of school. Benkadi is structured as a once-a-week, in-schedule arts program. In each class, students explore 4-5 drum rhythms and dances per semester, and learn about the history and culture of the countries where the rhythms originate. Benkadi is: Relatable: African rhythm is at the heart of popular music and is relatable for young people which translates into more active engagement. Accessible: a very low barrier-to-entry activity compared to more traditional western art forms and is accessible for students of all ages, abilities, proficiencies. Good for Mental Health: drum and dance is proven to have positive impacts on mental health and reducing anxiety and depression. Our classes get people moving and are fun. Increasing Cultural Awareness: Benkadi promotes awareness of African arts, culture and heritage. A full LA2050 grant would provide a weekly 1 hour class for 25 students in each of 3 grades for a full school year in 2 schools.

In class testing confirms academic progression with regards to cultural content. Students demonstrate competency and mastery through performances for the school and other communities. Self Reporting: Benkadi gives questionnaires to students, parents and teachers at the beginning and end of semesters for the collection of subjective and self-reported impact statements. Analysis: Benkadi works with the schools to review before and after grade, disciplinary and attendance records to discern any correlations between class participation and impacts on that data. Our data shows increased motivation in students to learn and attend school, increased focus and patience in given academic tasks, and a positive attitude in handling challenges in school.

The challenges of providing quality arts education in schools are long standing and increase disproportionately the lower the income of the community served. They will only increase in this time of falling attendances and economic downturn. The impact of arts program participation on students from low income backgrounds is profound - 5x less likely to drop out, 4x more likely to receive a bachelor's degree, 30% more inclined to pursue a profession, according to California Alliance for Arts Education data. In the context of youth arts programs LA needs to increase the diversity of represented cultures and backgrounds and deliver content accessible and appealing to all students.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "All of our programs aim to help systems-involved young people exit the child welfare and justice systems as soon as possible, avoid re-entry or recidivism, heal and cope with their trauma, safely return to their communities, and have long-term supports in place for their futures. Youth in foster care in LA County who are matched with CASAs are linked to more supportive services while in the system, perform better in school, are more likely to be placed in a stable home and are less likely to re-enter care. LA County foster care currently operates as a pipeline into homelessness, poverty and the prison system and will continue to do so until fundamental changes are made to how we care for our community's most vulnerable kids. We believe that a Los Angeles in which every young person in child welfare has an advocate and the opportunity to thrive in education and all areas of life is a safer, richer, more successful LA for all. Every day our team works hard to make this LA a reality.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "CASA/LA utilizes an internal data monitoring system called Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) to track individual case progress and measure overall program outcomes. In FY2021, CASA/LA served 1,360 children (5% increase from FY2020), recruited 324 new CASAs (17% increase) and organized 1,119 total CASAs (6% increase). During the same period, CASA/LA delivered the following advocacy outcomes for CASA youth whose cases closed (370): - 67% of youth in nonpermanent placement at assessment were in permanent placement at case closure - 62% had improved educational outcomes - 68% had improved mental health outcomes During the pandemic, CASAs stepped in to combat the educational obstacles that arose during homeschooling. This included helping youth access technology and internet so that they could participate virtually in school and extracurriculars; helping caregivers define their own roles in the child’s virtual learning; connecting youth directly to high quality academic services; and much more.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "A grant from LA2050 will allow us to train and organize more CASA volunteers to serve more systems-impacted youth with vital educational advocacy. We match CASAs one-to-one with youth who have been identified by the courts as having acute educational issues and are at risk of falling behind or dropping out of school. CASAs attend Individualized Education Program (IEP) meetings, gather educational records, and communicate directly with school staff to ensure youth have all the supports they need to succeed. CASAs monitor credits and attendance and link youth to appropriate classes, credit recovery and tutoring programs. CASAs can also advocate for a child to move to a different school (such as a smaller school with smaller classes) that support their individual needs, often leading to better academic performance and ability to connect with classmates and teachers. 41% of CASAs hold educational rights for the children they serve, allowing them to make decisions about school placement, advocate for IEPs, and link children and caregivers to external services. CASAs also connect youth to non-punitive and prosocial activities that promote healing. For older youth, including Expectant and Parenting Youth (EPY), CASAs ensure they have what they need to achieve self sufficiency, including supporting them in achieving post-secondary and occupational goals. In the case of EPY, CASAs also make sure these young parents have what they need to keep their own babies out of foster care.",
    "Describe the specific role of the partner organization(s) in the project, program, or initiative.": "Though we are not submitting a collaborative proposal, CASA/LA works with many community and government partners to deliver services, promote the welfare of children in dependency care, identify the needs of our clients and of the child welfare community at large, and prevent duplication of services. Our established service linkage and referral partners include: DCFS; Children’s Law Center; Alliance for Children’s Rights; Public Counsel; Disability Rights Center; Children’s Hospital LA; Butterfly’s Haven Housing Facility for EPY (includes free child care on premises); Youth Advocate Programs; First Step Staffing (helps CASA youth find employment); Cypress College's Foster Youth Program; Pasade City College's Foster Youth Program; and more."

The lifelong health problems associated with poor nutrition (particularly in childhood) are another way in which existing economic racial inequities are perpetuated and increased, but it doesn’t have to be this way. One part of the solution is ensuring that every eligible family in LA County enrolls in CalFresh and access the thousands of dollars available. We will pilot and test a new model for increasing awareness and utilization of CalFresh benefits, with a focus on low-income Black women and their families. Over the grant period, we anticipate reaching 35,000+ women with information about CalFresh and helping 240 or more women apply for the benefit program. Longer-term, we hope to prove our approach works and scale our efforts, thereby vastly increasing awareness of CalFresh generally and raising CalFresh eligible participation rates to as close as 100% as possible.",

    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Pilot or new project, program, or initiative",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "We seek to address food insecurity and food access for low-income Black women in LA County, particularly in South and West LA. From a recent poll taken by community members who participate in our bi-weekly Food Distribution program, we know that 45% live in households earning $40K or less. With inflation and a recession looming, it is nearly impossible for most of our community members to purchase produce and nutrient rich food that will aid in the health and wellness of themselves and their families. Food has become increasingly expensive while wages have stagnated and income inequality increased, which too often forces our community members to make food choices based on cost rather than nutritional value. As a result, our members are at greater risk for health related issues, chronic illness, and obesity. CalFresh dollars can help improve healthy food access and reduce the impacts of racial income inequities, but too many eligible families don’t claim the funds available."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "During the pandemic, Housing Works frontline workers quickly assessed that their most elderly and ill participants were, quite literally, starving due to the issues listed above. In response, we launched Food Boost, a life-saving intervention that delivers a hot meal and a grocery box to people living in permanent supportive housing who are assessed as being food insecure. The food delivery also provides an extra \"check in\" to ensure that participants are safe, eating and able to communicate. We now consider Food Boost to be an essential component of our housing retention supports continuum. We partner with EFSP, the Hollywood Food Coalition and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet to offer twice-weekly deliveries to 200 individuals. Given the vulnerability of our service population, we know that there are more people who would benefit from Food Boost, but we are limited by our delivery capacity. Housing Works is seeking an LA2050 grant to purchase a Ford Transit Delivery van, outfitted with a parcel delivery interior system and an attractive exterior wrap to promote Housing Works and LA2050. This van is easily loadable and can carry more than the cars we're currently using meaning that we can provide Food Boost to more people thanks to greater delivery efficiency. Housing Works is its participants' support system and connection to the world. Our staff is specially trained to work with people with mental illness, ensure their safety and housing retention.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "While there are segments of the population of people experiencing homelessness who are able to get back on their feet with relatively little assistance, Housing Works recognizes that there are some members of the community who are simply too mentally or physically ill to ever fully care for themselves without significant help. It is crucial to ensure that the people who are the most chronically homeless retain their housing and do not cycle back into homelessness at ground zero after significant resources have been dedicated to their housing. If we are to end Los Angeles' homelessness crisis, we need to find and fund multi-dimensional solutions that address the the different realities of homelessness. Food Boost may look simple on the surface, but housing retention supports that keep folks housed and healthy provide a tremendous return on investment in the form of savings to our safety-net systems. Food is a basic human right. Healthy, fresh, culturally relevant food is human decency.",

We slam the revolving door of homelessness shut, ensuring those who overcome extreme barriers to become housed will retain that housing for good. The 700 people we support in permanent supportive housing remain extremely at-risk, living on the margins on fixed incomes far below the poverty rate. They suffer from disabling physical and mental health conditions and are vulnerable to illness, injury, crime and food insecurity. Many are afraid to leave their apartments, struggle to navigate public transportation, and live in urban food deserts requiring travel out of the area. Food services, such as Meals on Wheels, are far too expensive and they are unable to access food banks. In ill health, they deserve fresh, healthy culturally relevant food options."

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "For generations our city has depended on the government to provide the solutions to societal challenges. Unfortunately the solutions typically benefitted those with means and failed at-risk populations. The need for change was critical. The Pandemic dramatically accelerated the need for change. Tragically, the Pico Union area suffered the second highest number of COVID cases and deaths of any community in Los Angeles. The spread of the virus was attributed to cramped, unsafe living conditions and lack of access to health care. We saw the Pandemic as an opportunity to bring a broken community together through jobs and shared responsibility. Groupo Verde gave people hope, a paycheck and a way to break the cycle of despair and poverty. Similar to the ways in which Neighborhood Watch was successful in engaging affluent communities, we believe Groupo Verde has the potential to build healthy, proud communities in at risk neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In the 1960s Lyndon Johnson launched his War on Poverty. The plan was to shrink dependence on government handouts and increase people’s ability to support their families. 50 years and $25 trillion later, we are still addressing the same issues, in the same way with systemic poverty worse than ever. Research shows there are two key factors impeding the chance of upward mobility. The first is opportunity - things like home life and a job. The second is quality of life - things like no access to grocery stores, green space, transportation or safe streets. Groupo Verde bridges these two challenges giving people the opportunity to work in their own community at jobs that directly improve the quality of life in their neighborhood. If COVID taught us anything, it is that we are stronger together. The sky is the limit when businesses, politicians, nonprofits, faith groups and government work together to create a more promising and equitable future.",

Closing the Achievement Gap: Using the Environment as an Integrating Context for Learning). A study by WestEd, the Lawrence Hall of Science and SRI International showed that 40% of elementary teachers spend 1 hour or less teaching science each week and only one third of elementary teachers feel prepared to teach science. The study was completed before the pandemic, which has created an even more urgent need to support STEM learning, particularly in marginalized communities.

We’ve discovered that over 25% of students attending a free field trip to the Roundhouse Aquarium are visiting the ocean for the first time. Over the past several years we’ve seen that through the participation in our hands-on programs students have gone from over 55% of them littering before the program to over 65% of them picking up trash after their field trip. There is also a significant increase in the number of students interested in a future career in science.

In fact, the average American elementary classroom devotes less than 20 minutes per day to science, but nearly 90 minutes to English/Language Arts and nearly one hour to mathematics, according to the National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education. Making science a fundamental part of K-5 instruction leverages students’ natural curiosity about the world, according to a 2021 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report. Furthermore, ensuring elementary school students, starting in kindergarten, spend sufficient time learning science each week is essential for the future STEM workforce and the pursuit of living wage jobs. Yet, the nation has a poor track record of advancing students of color out of K-12 into postsecondary learning opportunities and on to STEM professions. In fact, people of color make up 36% of the U.S. adult population but occupy only 11% of STEM positions.",

PS Science delivered its foundational science curriculum to 5,400+ K-5th grade students (the vast majority of whom are Black or Latinx and 76% come from low-income families) at Title 1 elementary schools throughout L.A. County during the 2021-22 school year. Weekly lessons include 60-90 minutes of engaging science experiments and hands-on activities that invite students to use their own curiosity and observations to “figure things out.” Our PS Science Instructors are content and teaching experts who work in coordination with classroom teachers to deliver a blend of biology, physics, earth science, chemistry, and engineering curricula—all fully prepared hands-on lesson materials are included and delivered to classrooms each week. Our instructors also provide customized teacher training and coaching, including instructional video lessons and email support. Beyond in-school programming, youth are engaged outside of normal school hours via after school science and coding clubs, family science nights engaging the whole family, spring break and S-TEAM Rangers summer camps, and enrichment classes, which further enforce science education PS Science delivers in school.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our unique model builds a bedrock of science knowledge among students at under-resourced elementary schools through hands-on, in-person instruction and customized teacher coaching — equipping schools to be able to offer a vibrant STEAM curriculum for cohorts of L.A. County students to come. Our standards-aligned science lessons not only give students the foundational science skills needed to thrive in upper-level science coursework, but also help them actualize STEAM professions as viable career paths and see science as a source of joy that ignites their imagination. With a grant through LA2050, PS Science will bring STEAM education to 6,000 under-resourced students — an 80% increase in students since the previous school year — and professional development to their teachers throughout L.A. PS Science will utilize funds to serve up to 50 additional classrooms of K-5th-grade students — equipping the next generation to pursue higher education and thrive in the future STEAM workforce.",

Additionally, we find that some people do have an understanding of these benefits, but lack the knowledge on how to effectively participate in decision-making processes. Unfortunately, the communities with the least access to this education are often low-income people of color, resulting in the perpetual marginalization of these communities and silencing of their collective community voice. Through our People’s Planning School, we have found that hundreds of our graduates are now well-equipped community leaders who have the tools they need to become active participants in progressive planning, policy, and politics, and possess a critical awareness of their built environment issues and opportunities. Taking People’s Planning School on the road can help to reach a broader audience who do not have a similar curriculum in their community.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "City Fabrick plans to broaden the reach of our program, which originally started to educate and empower Long Beach residents, by taking People’s Planning School on tour. This will involve retrofitting a van to both transport curriculum materials and activities to schools, parks, libraries, resource fairs, and other gathering spaces as well as to promote the program in new communities we travel to. Through data analysis, we will identify an initial six communities throughout the greater Los Angeles region and host two free classes (on housing and transportation) to educate the community about the history, opportunities, and tools to get involved in local planning and policy. Pop-up educational material will be developed in multiple languages and designed to be highly visual, interactive, and fun, increasing accessibility to people of all ages. City Fabrick will work with local partners to identify a planning or policy issue going on in their community to increase public awareness and involvement. City Fabrick will also identify and stipend local experts and activists to support in this effort, providing local residents with increased knowledge about how cities form and evolve as well as the political and policy forces that effect those changes. City Fabrick staff, who are highly skilled in design, planning, and policy, will also support in curriculum development.

Joe saw his clients deteriorating and dying. After suffering from work related depression, he gave up on outreach work. His experience is not an isolated one. According to the 5th annual “Global State of Frontline Work Experience Study” 50% of frontline workers are contemplating leaving their jobs. 58% cite burnout as the #1 reason. In homeless services, outreach workers are trained in trauma-informed care but in the context of their clients. We focus on the job-related trauma that the staff members experience. With a profound shortage of housing, their clients are deteriorating and dying before a unit is available. This takes an overwhelming toll on staff. Additionally, staff are reporting health challenges- depression, anxiety, trauma, and burnout due to the challenges of their jobs. When staff suffers, it affects the unhoused, the agencies, and ultimately, the communities.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "California has the highest number of homeless in the US. In LA alone, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) reports at least 63,700 unhoused living on our streets. Outreach is one of our city’s most difficult and demanding jobs, and agencies are losing staff at an alarming rate. In 2021, Westside Coalition identified a gap in services, and we were one of the first non-profits to offer self-care for the staff of our agencies. Our plan forward is to continue to provide free trauma informed care trainings and support to our frontline staff. We will have a mental health professional lead each training. We will also teach varied self-care modalities, knowing not everyone is drawn to yoga or meditation. This allows attendees to choose what works best for them. And we will provide enhanced networking. Having a peer who understands the same challenges provides an additional level of support. Each training can stand alone but each topic will build upon the overall program. For those who can’t attend our trainings at the designated times, we will upload YouTube videos to our website so they can participate on their own time. This program has been met with great success in 2021, and we plan to continue it indefinitely. Supporting frontline workers will not only benefit the staff members, but their clients, agencies and ultimately the communities. Our aim in supporting these heroes is to help them stay in their jobs and flourish, so our communities can flourish once again.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "With a vast population of unhoused in LA that continues to grow, the outreach workers are an essential component to keep our city operational. If we lose them, we will lose our fight against homelessness. What the public doesn’t realize is that a shortage of outreach is one of the main reasons for our homeless crisis. No amount of housing and shelter beds can help if there are no outreach workers to take on the cases- to help people get IDs, clothing, food, jobs, and services. It is needed to help the displaced take the necessary steps to go from the streets to shelters. We have to improve the working conditions for our service providers to keep them in their jobs. The first step in doing that is to do welfare checks. For our staff to help others, it’s important they don’t forget to help themselves first. Our trainings will ensure our staff cares for themselves as they care for others. This will encourage them to remain in their jobs so they can continue the essential work they do.",

Youth are eligible to participate in ITSP for up to 24 months during the ages of 16-21. A CII Transition Development Specialist (TDS) partners with each TAY to shape the program curriculum to best address the youth’s strengths and responsibilities. The TDS meets with each youth at least two sessions per month, with sessions ranging from 4-5 hours. Youth are also supported by an Employment Specialist who works individually with each youth to develop career paths and secure employment. They also coordinate group employment activities, such as career fairs, resume writing workshops, mock interviews, etc. The Education Specialist plays an additional role in the success of TAY as they offer personalized college guidance counseling and FAFSA/scholarship workshops. CII is also piloting a scholarship program to help youth attend college. To complement the individual work, ITSP youth also participate in two group activities- TAY Talks and the Fostering Social Skills Group. These groups provide critical opportunities for youth to build informal social support networks with their peers while also engaging in topics related to young adults. The newest support group (The Bright Room) was created to support the LGBTQ+ population within our ITSP program, which was identified by the youth as an area of additional need.",

Approximately 2,000 youth in foster care exit the system each month, including transition-aged youth (TAY). The vast majority of TAY leave the foster care system ill-prepared for the most fundamental aspects of adulthood. About a third of former L.A. County foster youth are homeless and more than half are unemployed within 2-4 years of emancipation. Across the nation, 50% of the homeless population spent time in the foster care system. A key factor behind unsuccessful transitions is a lack of educational attainment. The graduation rate for foster youth in LAUSD is around 52%, well below the district wide rate of 77% and below the state’s foster youth average of 58%. TAY are simply not meeting the minimum requirements for many entry level employment opportunities. Moreover, only 20% of foster youth will attended college, and only 9% will graduate.",

In addition to using the results of the assessment to individualize ITSP services, all program staff have a working knowledge of adolescent development, particularly how trauma and out-of-home placements can impact development. The following features of adolescent development are of particular importance: physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. Together, these developmental changes create the backdrop for the context of the staff-youth relationship. The CLSA has measured the following ITSP outcomes last fiscal year: 97% had no barriers to self-sufficiency, 90% had knowledge of how to obtain safe/affordable housing, 94% increased self-advocacy skills, and 85% developed permanent connections/relationships with trusted adults, family and/or friends."

Jim De Pompei, Director of Programs, conducts on-going program evaluations. This enables us to revise and adjust programs, based on feedback and stated needs of educators. Time and time again, we have parents participate in our public programs who are excited for their children to experience the same activities that inspired them as children. All of these things combined show us we are making an impact.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "By combining science and fun, we inspire exploration, respect and conservation of Southern California marine life. Jacques Yves Cousteau said it best, \"People protect what they love.\" That's why we incorporate activities into all of our education and outreach programs that will help spark that love. During an ocean outreach class, children have the opportunity to touch ocean animals. During Spring Outdoor Classroom, children sit in the sand close to the ocean. During our grunion run events, families hatch grunion eggs and see fish born right before their eyes. All of our programs include our famous interactive \"do-it, do-its\" where people dance like a jellyfish or swim like a grunion. After participating in Cabrillo Marine Aquarium's education and outreach programs, Los Angeles County students of all ages will have a greater appreciation and respect for the ocean and will be more likely to take actions to help protect the coastal resources we all benefit from.",

Less than half of principals say they believe their schools are adequately prepared to meet state science standards. Meanwhile, the public is inundated with depressing doomsday messages about climate change and the environment. Our programs make science come alive for students of all ages and bring fun and excitement back to ocean conservation. For example, a lesson by our Ocean Outreach staff gives students the opportunity to learn about and interact with live ocean animals at school. Many of our student visitors tell us they’ve never been to the beach before their field trip to Cabrillo Marine Aquarium. Our goal is to pique their interest with programs that meet state science standards and then lure them back (with their parents) so they can take a deeper dive if they so desire."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "It is well established that experiential and active-learning educational programs lead to positive youth development and improved learning. Furthermore, studies show participation in outdoor education programs leads to less aggression, better emotional regulation, higher cognitive function, more adept social skills, involved environmental stewardship, health benefits, improved classroom engagement, increased academic achievement and motivation, and a broadening of career interests. LAMI's Sail the Course incorporates all of these positive attributes while also being specifically tailored to teach strategies to strength mental health, communication, and competency. forty-five youth between the ages of 11 and 16 will be selected by a juvenile diversion mediator to participate in the program. Each young person will participate in four 3-hour sails over their time in the program, each sail with 15 participants, a small group so that instruction can be individualized. The activities of each sail will be specifically and intentionally created to build on past learning and advancing knowledge and maturation. Education Crew will be trained in specialty areas of instruction through workshops prior to the participant sails. Infused throughout the sails are intentional encouragement on self-discovery, peer-relatedness, and communication. Ultimately it is the sailing and the sea that creates an applied and emotional connection to learning for the students and institutional memory.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Heartbreakingly, many youth are subjected to disproportionate challenges as a result of social, cultural, and economic stressors, resulting in behavioral and mental presentations that jeopardize their participation in meaningful academic, home, and societal experiences. These system-impacted youth face an uphill battle in acquiring the life skills and support that keep them on course to mature, stay safe, and develop into productive members of society. For some, damaging mental distortions and/or behaviors have lead to criminal or serious school violations, only decrease the likelihood these young offenders will attend school, graduate, and avoid a life subjected to drugs and incarceration without some form of intervention.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles County will be introduced to a new model intervention program for young offenders that uses somatic active learning through a challenging but safe medium of tall ship sailing. Sail the Course will be further proof that the investment in an at-risk child through an immersive experiential program will be far more valuable than the potential cost that is attributed to an unproductive citizen or one whose future includes incarceration or societal harm. For these youth and their radius of contact, including family and community, a child kept on course for a more healthy development and future, the outcome is priceless - including graduating from school and joining the workforce.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "LAMI will work with consulting experts to create a pre and post survey to gauge participant attitudes and understanding of present and future self reflections, perceptions of others and differing environments, and projections and conclusions of the program. We will also track longitudinal impacts from the program on the participants, including but not limited to school attendance, academic performance, support received, and future activities."

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Through LBIRC’s organizing, power building, and leadership academies, our project goals will include the following: build the leadership and advocacy skills of undocumented community and non-detained individuals in deportation proceedings; provide community members in our leadership pipelines with political education on topics like: history of imperialism, systems of oppression, history of detention in the U.S., patriarchy, transformative justice, criminalization of Immigration; and create the conditions to ensure immigrants have the education and resources they need to flourish and build power. LBIRC’s leadership pipeline and academies will equip community members to build power amongst one another, push for local policy change and budget advocacy, and change the ecosystem in their own communities. Concurrently, community members will gain access and support their own health via resources to safety net programs including LBIRC’s own mutual community care hub which addresses food apartheid in Long Beach, and nourishes more than 600 families a year. Furthermore, community members will deepen their leadership skills by engaging in advocacy opportunities to apply learned material to local, statewide and national campaigns, participate in legislative and advocacy opportunities.Ultimately, through this programming, community members will build power and lead the cultural shift necessary to build and sustain an immigrant led movement, enabling every immigrant to thrive.",

At the LA county level, 36% of the 10 million residents are immigrants and 24% are undocumented and face disproportionate and layered challenges. Illuminated by intersectionality as a lens, these challenges are byproducts of multiple systems of power such as racist nativism, colonialism, and classism. When it comes to the divergent needs of immigrant communities, resources alone are not enough to create a healthy, vibrant, and thriving South Bay for immigrants. It is through dynamic leadership investment, political education on systems of power, pedagogy on how to shift policy, community centered power building that we secure the necessary fortitude to have conditions where all immigrants flourish.",

The Community Wellness Clinic opened its doors In 2019, in partnership with Saban Community Clinic, and serves as a safe and extremely low-barrier referral point for emergency and primary healthcare needs for people experiencing homelessness. More than 50% of our participants identify as people of color, 14% identify as transgender, and over 65% are Chronically homeless, meaning they have lived on the streets for a year or more. Often, those who have sought medical care at The Center’s on-site Community Wellness Clinic have not sought primary care for years, sometimes decades. The Community Wellness Clinic is beginning its third full year of operation, and as we move out of the chaos that was the pandemic, we are dedicated to reinvesting time and energy into reimagining and improving healthcare delivery for our city's unhoused residents.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "While there are thousands of agencies dedicated to homelessness in L.A, The Center utilizes a radically different approach to solve the problem. The Community Wellness Clinic gets results by focusing on relationship rather than transactional interactions. Daily groups provide the unhoused a safe place to re-engage with society, and extremely low-barrier practices allow folks to obtain healthcare without ID cards, signing in, giving their name, or even having to be inside the building (clinicians will meet clients on the curb if requested). By reconnecting to healthcare and community, folks are more able to pursue permanent housing. In terms of measuring success for this project, we will track the rate of initial appointment and follow-up appointment attendance for clients, number of clients that move in to permanent housing, number of partnerships with outside agencies, and how many new, innovative methods of health care delivery are created and implemented.",

Even more concerning is that these numbers are up by 13% from 2019 homeless count data. If this trend continues, by 2050 there will be upwards of 325,000 individuals experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. The Center's vision is that there will be less than 5,000 people experiencing health crises and homelessness in Los Angeles county by 2050. In the long-term, The Center aims to meet this goal by sustainably scaling-up our unique programming model so that the healthcare and housing success that our clients enjoy can be experienced exponentially throughout Los Angeles. In the short-term, The Center plans to expand the on-site Community Wellness Clinic to help unhoused clients move towards holistic health and permanent housing to get people off the streets for good.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "CS occupations are growing faster than average across the labor market (BLS, 2020). Yet women and people of color remain widely underrepresented across CS fields. As of 2020, only 18% of software developers are female, and only 6% are Black or Latinx (BLS, 2020). A key driver of these disparities is a lack of access to early, consistent, high-quality CS education in public schools. In 2016, the federal Computer Science for All initiative recognized CS as a “new basic” skill set “necessary for economic opportunity and social mobility.” Yet the 2021 State of Computer Science report estimated that only 7.3% of elementary school students have access to CS courses and that Black, Latinx, and female students remain widely underrepresented. CS education opportunities are typically geared toward high school students, but reaching children early in their education has powerful implications for marginalized students’ building their identity as problem solvers who belong in the STEM world.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "9 Dots’ original K-6 Get Coding curriculum challenges student stereotypes about who can and should engage in CS. Through Get Coding, youth build self-confidence in their unique capabilities and identities as coders and problem solvers. Students develop proficiency in CS concepts and practices across grade bands through Get Coding, starting with unplugged activities in Kindergarten and progressing to introductory JavaScript by the 5th grade. Get Coding is structured as a one-hour standalone class, taught once a week during the standard school day for thirty weeks (the academic year). Aligned with Next Generation Science, Common Core, and the new California state CS standards, each curriculum level consists of three modules of ten lessons. The final module consists of an interactive project such as creating interactive stories and drawing emojis with code. In other words, Get Coding is an engaging and dynamic way to reach underrepresented students who are less likely to elect to participate in an after-school coding class or club. By offering CS classes as part of the standard school week, 9 Dots ensures that all students gain an early foundation in technical, computational thinking, and problem-solving skills, encouraging students to feel empowered to evaluate and drive future innovations. The confidence and competence students gain through Get Coding allow youth to build an identity as people who can and will pursue CS higher education and careers.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Get Coding success is measured against several service-related goals: 1) completing K-6 pathways at our partner schools; 2) graduating 75% of Level 2 teachers to independent coding instructors; 3) 60% of our Get Coding students reaching grade-level proficiency. Progress towards these goals is measured using quantitative and qualitative data. 9 Dots tracks the number of teachers, students, and schools we serve to measure impact. We will have 28 partner schools for SY 2022-23, 14 of them with full K-6 CS pathways and we are on track for 75% of our Level 2 teachers to graduate to independence for SY 2022-23. Student proficiency data is collected through the 9 Dots platform, tracking student progress through each lesson throughout all modules. At the end of each module, Level Up challenges test mastery of previous lesson content and measure proficiency in the coding and problem-solving skills required to complete the challenges successfully. Student proficiency is currently exceeding 60%.",

These efforts work together to bring consistent, sustainable CS education to thousands of students throughout LA County. Our goal is to expand Get Coding to four new Title I partner schools in LA County next year, serving an estimated 10,000 students and 340 teachers.

The reasons are complex and unaddressed by current education and nonprofit programming. According to the Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Black and Latinx students are significantly more likely than their white peers to identify social change as essential to their career goals. Black and Latinx students’ disproportionate interest in social justice is causally linked to their underrepresentation in STEM. Additionally, the myth that STEM is for older students, which has been debunked by research supported by the National Science Foundation, has contributed to funding being concentrated in higher grade levels, depriving students of a critical foundation for future learning. Filtering Black and Latinx students out of STEM can impact the trajectory of their life and perpetuate social injustices in need of technical solutions.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "STTF addresses this dire STEM career pipeline gap by delivering social justice and STEAM-based learning experiences in structured after-school and summer school settings within the community that invites parent and/or caregiver engagement. Our Theory and Practice (TxP) programs are student-led initiatives in which youth combine justice, STEAM, and activism as they work together to reimagine and create the communities they want and deserve. They are guided through the process of (1) creating a clear vision for the world they want and deserve, (2) using STEAM to develop projects that support their vision, and (3) connecting with the community and grassroots organizations to build and implement their projects. For this request, we are expanding our STEAM Residency program, which pairs TxP youth with STEAM practitioners and activists. Our STEAM residents will lead students through project-based learning experiences that are aligned with their profession and help meet an unmet need in the community. We are prioritizing practitioners and creatives who are Black, Latinx, and live or work in the same communities as our students. We’ve piloted this approach through our TxP initiative, Build’ Em Up Robotics, where Black and Latina girls were taught coding and robotics by two women of color both of which were engineers.

Additionally, we will begin analyzing our outcomes data so that we can refine our curriculum so that we can scale through sharing resources and teacher development and ultimately serve more youth. If our work is successful, Black and Brown youth in Los Angeles will be creating the pathways to liberating their communities. We envision more educators holding spaces like ours where students can dream up the world they want and deserve. More youth deserve the opportunity to live in those spaces and to be exposed to community organizing at a young age, in their own communities. They will have discovered the strength of the community and that they have the power and ability to create the world they want and deserve.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "STTF defines success through evidenced-based student learning and engagement outcomes, including: -100% of students were able to identify at least 3 contradictions in their community. -100% of students were able to use STEAM to meet at least one unmet need in their community -100% of students enjoyed classes that were taught by STEAM Residents from our community partner, Sustainable Economic Enterprises of Los Angeles (SEE_LA) -100% of students who attended our community partner events, including a mutual aid event with Japanese Town Action and Solidarity and our pop-up store with All Power Books, said that they wanted to do more of these events. Given these successful outcomes, especially the success we have had with every child identifying unmet needs in their community and working with peers to create something that addresses that unmet need, is evidence that our approach is working.

The situation in Los Angeles is particularly dire. We’ve attempted to get people into sober livings to no avail; no beds are available, or the cost is too high. For many women struggling with substance use disorder in South Los Angeles, poverty, lack of education/employment, generational trauma, and the high cost of housing hinder positive life changes. Providing a recovery residence with full-service Recovery Community programs free of charge, will remove the barriers that have kept women in South LA from receiving desperately needed peer-to-peer recovery services.",

As LARC’s community and standing grows, former residents will have the support of the LARC Community to help sustain their recovery. In turn, they can serve new residents/community members. We are replacing a cycle of addiction with a cycle of connection and support."

Equitable access to these places would advance public health, beautify civic life, and foster community connections as well as individual engagement. They would also address climate challenges and environmental resiliency by functioning as neighborhood emergency kits in times of need. NRG program elements include: environmental education (STEAM for students of all ages); disaster prep based on government resiliency recommendations (off grid electricity, water, food, communications hub, community leadership); drought tolerant gardens (color, scent, food, compost); organizational resources as well as inspiring examples of best practices. Overlaying shared use of open spaces such as existing schoolyards, parks, libraries, vacant lots, etc. with resiliency hubs could quickly and efficiently activate NRGs in neighborhoods throughout LA. Identifying and collaborating with established organizations by aligning their missions (education, environment, gardens, public health, safety, social welfare, water) would amplify the impact of their initiatives and resources (projects, programs, locations). NRGs cultivate and sustain healthy, beautiful, and resilient common ground to uniquely connect neighborhoods and advance healthy community life.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The impact zone of each site extends well beyond individual locations to serve entire neighborhoods: Fostering community connections offer opportunities for more individual empathy and empowerment, increasing neighborhood bonds and safety. Environmental education provides students of all ages access to critical information for improving their own health and well-being as well as the Earth’s. Neighborhood Resource Gardens engage individual and community groups at the local level while connecting with larger entities in LA and beyond (government, NGOs, residents, philanthropies, foundations, businesses) to connect resources that help activate, program, maintain and network these sites. Successful implementation of the NRG program would improve the health and sustainability of environments and neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles in both the short and long term.",

This particular field, called Tommy's Field, was uniquely designed with no fence or lock to ensure free and unstructured play for all. Already, the field accommodates hundreds of free play users- children and adults- every day, which is a rare treat in our city. Tommy's Field has also allowed Westwood Rec to offer new affordable and creative youth programming - including holiday camps and a youth flag football fall and spring program that already has over 250 children playing in it every week. The field has also become a place where adults exercise and play with their peers and it has further inspired other communities in Los Angeles to collaborate and pool resources for the benefit of public parks and schools in their own neighborhoods. The model is already a success. We can't wait for Vista and other parts of LA to further benefit from it.",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The TM23 Foundation believes that now, more than ever, it is critical to provide safe and beautiful spaces in Los Angeles where children can engage with their community and play. Our city struggles to provide enough field space for athletics and free play. Soccer, for example, is the #1 youth team sport in our city, and among the most diverse, and yet Los Angeles has only four (4) public soccer fields (used for multiple sports) for every 100,000 residents compared to 16.7 fields per 100,000 residents nationally. Traditional grass athletic fields are virtually impossible for schools and parks in our city to maintain due to our region's history of drought, escalating maintenance costs and hazards associated with fertilizers / chemicals. This field refurbishment fully supports our Mayor's Park Proud LA city-wide initiative to convert grass athletic fields for the benefit of our environment and to support more types of recreation and the increasing demand our city has for play.",

During the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years, UEC created the HOS program with both a virtual and in-person learning platform for family homes throughout the City of Compton to build culturally relevant projects that highlight science, technology, engineering, art and math for students in grades K-6. Over the course of nine months, weekly family cohorts gathered for online instruction and community building. Monthly, Compton HOS families showcased their home-engineered projects at Family Fun Days and explained the creation and execution process of each project. Selected projects included a large Paper Mache Exploding Volcano, Catapult, Lava Lamp, Zoetrope, Paint Rockets, Growing Caterpillars into Butterflies, Building & Coding an mBot Robot and creating a variety of electrical circuits. A marine biologist and a mechanical engineer volunteered to be on staff. For 2022-23, to address the oversaturation of online learning hours for Compton families, HOS will build on accomplishments of previous years and become a supplemental academic hybrid program for 50 K-6 Compton youth & their families to experience STEAM education through hands-on training, building projects, attending field trips & speaking with BIPOC professionals in STEM career fields.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "According to the 2020 U.S. Census count, the number of people identifying as Asian in LA County grew by 11.4%, far more than any other group. That’s equal to an increase of 153,199 residents. The overall county growth in the last decade was 195,404 (a net 2% increase). Population growth and gentrification in Koreatown have created an unprecedented number of unhoused AAPI. Mainstream homeless service providers have been overwhelmed by the increase in unhoused English and Spanish speakers to keep up with unhoused AAPI. As such, AAPI slipped through the cracks. \"Count the Uncounted: Unhoused AAPI\" will shift the narrative unhoused AAPI and shed light on the issue. It will also help expand our existing outreach and services. Recognizing the real number of unhoused AAPI will bring additional services including housing. We want to make LA a truly inclusive and safer place for all by counting the uncounted in order to expand in-language, culturally competent support to unhoused AAPI.",

One month ago, we decided to include two more shifts in our outreach to focus specifically on unhoused AAPI. We define and measure our success by counting and mapping unhoused AAPI and getting them into a mainstream, grassroots, and ethnic network of homeless service providers. We will also use our count to advocate for an AAPI homeless service center in Koreatown. We already have a commercial space that we can convert.

They report linguistic and cultural discrimination by mainstream housing providers. They also report racialized bullying, harassment, or even assault by non-AAPI shelter residents. Mainstream homeless service providers like LAHSA, PATH, and SABAN often lack staff who speak Los Angeles's threshold Asian languages: Korean, Chinese, Tagalog, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Monolingual English-speaking or non-Asian language-speaking staff cannot do adequate outreach to unhoused AAPI. They also do not have the cultural knowledge to identify different AAPI or where AAPI might hide. Hence, unhoused AAPI are drastically undercounted.

In the long term, this early intervention will help transform children’s outcomes for life. We do mean “transform.” The achievement gap between foster youth and the general population is staggering, with foster youth trailing their peers in standardized test performance, high school graduation (in California, only 53% of foster youth graduate high school on time vs 83% of youth in general), and postsecondary education (only 3% of foster youth graduate college). Research shows that foster youth experience disproportionately high rates of homelessness (11%-38%) and commit more crimes (90% of youth with 5 or more placements become involved in the criminal justice system). The training we propose can mitigate those statistics.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We are applying a proven model to a new population: in post-workshop surveys, almost every provider praised the critical nature and effectiveness of our TIC training and expressed the need for parents/caregivers to also receive it. We also know it is timely through a recent annual survey of over 600 Early Childhood Care providers and teachers across LA County. While the full report has not yet been released, preliminary findings confirm that families in ECE programs are challenged by stress (69%), financial insecurity (58%), and joblessness (43%) – issues that are causing an increase in challenging behaviors exhibited by their children (37%), behaviors that already-stressed parents are less able to address with patience and understanding. While these results apply to low-income families in general, we worry that parental stress will exacerbate poor reactions in the case of foster families. In all, building trauma-resistant communities has become a critical goal for our organization.",

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Young children who suffer trauma experience long-lasting negative effects including brain impairments, problems forming attachments, and significant mental health conditions. They develop unhealthy behaviors and habits such as aggression and disobeying adults. LA County has 30,000 children in foster care – 30% under 5. Each of them has experienced trauma—often abuse and neglect, but at a minimum, separation from their birth family. Foster parents who do not comprehend this experience may misjudge the child’s negative behavior, addressing it with efforts that are ineffectual and damaging. Worse, they may inflict even more trauma by disrupting the placement (most children in foster care more than 24 months experience 3 or more placements). Foster parents are not routinely provided with an understanding of TIC. We need to change this, starting now, so that children in foster care can find the safety that will mitigate the effects of their trauma and transform their lifetime outcomes.",

Young children suffering from trauma generally have difficulty regulating behaviors and emotions, which may make them clingy, fearful of new situations, easily frightened, difficult to console, and/or aggressive and impulsive. They may have difficulty sleeping, lose developmental skills, show regression in functioning and behavior. It is vital that foster parents recognize these as symptoms of trauma and react with therapeutic procedures – and we must teach them how to do this. We propose a-3-pronged approach: trauma trainings, 1:1 consultations, and group programming. We would offer 2-4 workshop/seminars per month (in English and Spanish) to introduce TIC and offer concrete strategies to soothe a child exhibiting difficult behaviors and promote regulation and executive functioning, to implement routines and smooth transitions, and to reduce caregiver stress. The 1:1 consultations (20-40 per month, 30-60 mins each) would address the inevitable individual issues. And the group programming, part of our ongoing Family Engagement Initiative (4 events per month), would offer additional opportunities to build skills and discover tools to support their family’s resiliency, expand the social emotional development of children, and enhance the social connectedness of parents.",

Training will be guided by industry best management practices outlined by organizations such as the International Society of Arboriculture. This will be supplemented with earth and urban sciences to provide a holistic understanding of urban environmental systems. As a related field, wildland management curriculum and field training will complement arboriculture training and provide youth with exposure to more career opportunities in natural spaces.

House of Ruth uses an evidence-based model to respond to this public health crisis. The Domestic Violence Housing First model is an innovative approach that focuses on helping survivors obtain safe and stable housing as quickly as possible with the use of flexible funds, while providing ongoing supportive services to improve the overall safety and well-being of domestic violence survivors and their families.",

    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Housing First model is built on three pillars: Survivor-Driven, Trauma-Informed Mobile Advocacy; Flexible Funding Assistance; and Community Engagement. Advocates focus on addressing the needs identified by survivors rather than on pre-determined needs promoted by agencies. Advocates are mobile and are trained in trauma-informed practice. Many survivors need not only safe and stable housing, but also temporary financial assistance. They may need assistance with issues directly related to housing or funds that are critical to housing stability. Funds are targeted to support survivors so they can rebuild their lives. Proactive engagement with housing providers, other service providers and community members changes how the community responds to domestic violence. The model acknowledges participants have different needs to secure stable housing. Low need is a one-time funding request including food, childcare, utility bill assistance and one-time emergency assistance such as car repair costs, lock changes, limited vocational costs, healthcare costs and transportation. Medium need assistance includes any items in the low need category, rental security deposit, and up to 6 months of rental assistance. High need assistance includes all aforementioned items with up to 24 months of rental assistance to provide the opportunity to build savings, increase employment readiness through vocational or educational programs, and address trauma or other mental health needs during this time.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Since 2016, several domestic violence shelters in California have adopted the Housing First model, including House of Ruth. Impact is measured in several ways with the primary measure being number of participants who remained in stable housing upon exiting the program. Additional indicators of success include participants reporting that they learned more ways to plan for their safety and felt more hopeful about the future. These last two indicators may seem like small goals, but due to the nature of domestic violence, understanding safety planning and feeling hopeful about one’s future are critical indicators of a survivor continuing to live a life free of violence. Last year, out of the 56 participants in the Housing First Program, 20 found permanent housing and 36 received financial support to remain in stable housing. Upon exiting the program, all 56 participants remained in stable housing and avoided homelessness. 100% of participants learned more ways to plan for their safety.",

Survivors fleeing from domestic violence should not lose their housing as a result. Too often this is a reality for families impacted by domestic violence. Implementing the Housing First model in Los Angeles County means more financial and emotional support is available to survivors and their families. It will result in less homelessness as a direct result of domestic violence and reduce the likelihood of survivors returning to an abusive relationship out of desperation. When survivors have the financial support to secure their basic needs, while having access to mental and emotional support to start to heal from their trauma, they are much more likely to continue making healthy decisions for themselves and their families. Domestic violence is more than a familial issue; it is a public health issue impacting all of us. When individuals and families thrive, our communities thrive as a result.",

    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "Housing and Homelessness",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "On any single day in California, domestic violence advocates respond to an estimated 5,884 requests for services, and over 1,000 requests go unmet because of lack of resources, reported by the CA Census of Domestic Violence Services in 2021. Nearly half of these unmet requests (42%) are for emergency shelter and housing, the most critical safety service for survivors and their families. According to the 2018 Report on the Status of Women in LA County, over 42,000 calls for domestic violence assistance were made in LA County alone in 2017. In addition, nearly a third (30%) of all homeless individuals in LA County are survivors of domestic violence. These patterns reflect the need we hear from our community. Most of our clients (about 90%) come from low income or poverty level households and need to secure safe housing before addressing additional stressors. We start with housing because we know a person can only start to heal from their trauma when their basic needs are met."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed systemic problems in Los Angeles County, including decades of underinvestment in affordable housing, public transportation, and other infrastructure needed to build a more just and equitable society. Historic wildfires, the country's worst air quality, and the fact that 50% of climate emissions in California come from transportation put into stark relief the need to address our auto-dependence. And yet, our transit system can be slow, unreliable, unaffordable, and unsafe, especially for those who use it the most. For instance, 90% of LA Metro's riders earn less than $30k/year, and while the average Angelenos can access 2.8 million jobs in 45 minutes by car, African American Angelenos using transit can only access about 150,000 jobs within the same timeframe.

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "1. We are measuring impacts in partnership with the TransitCenter through their Equity Dashboard which tracks data on transit equity and access: https://dashboard.transitcenter.org/. Better infrastructure for buses, cycling, walking, and rail should shorten travel times and provide reliable service for riders, helping to address the significant racial access gaps to reach job opportunities. The impact can be measured by several factors but the most important is their ability to reach their destination in a timely manner. 2. Restoring Metro bus service to pre-pandemic levels, the Universal Basic Mobility pilot, and the fare-free student pass pilot program will have measurable results on ridership. For instance, student ridership has increased dramatically since the pilot launched last year. 3. State and local governments and nonprofits track housing production, homelessness prevention, and tenant protections, which should all measurably increase if our initiative is successful.",

The Forest will be open to ECF children M-F. All children will be welcome on Saturdays with their adult. With more resources we will increase the days it is open to all. During the grant period and beyond, children will learn about climate change, gardening best practices, organic and healthy living, growing their own food without pesticides in this garden and how to make their own gardens - even on a window sill - by planting the top of a carrot or clipping a head of lettuce or sprouting an avocado pit, etc. Children will learn to be environmentally conscientious stewards of Earth, realizing their place in it all. The Children’s Forest will be overseen and cared for by our gardening staff with additional volunteers as a weekly cooperative. We will hire a dedicated docent-gardener for upkeep, questions and helping at Saturday children’s workshops. Small bike paths will meander through trees and gardens while pollinators thrive.

This initiative is founded on the idea that shared information is a crucial part of economic development, particularly in a field which relies so heavily on specialty training. We believe that public libraries play a crucial role in disseminating knowledge, and we will provide just that: a staffed reference library housing the 2,336 books and aromatic molecules that the IAO has collected in its decade of operations. We'll supplement this with an online database of historic and contemporary perfume formulas, and commissioned or collected essays and training materials. Rooted in action, we will also implement a training program that emphasizes applied learning through business mentorships, industry speakers, classes, and a funded accelerator program supporting new L.A.-based BIPOC and women-led perfume businesses.

Working with scent has allowed us to communicate with one another and with our gods, and has been involved in important human activities like wellness, art-making, and so much more. With this said, the multi-billion dollar perfume industry has evolved along a model that places primacy on European modes of expression and commerce. This manifests at every level of the industry: how perfume is marketed, who gets trained, and who gets to participate in the business, as a whole. The field is ruled by several multinational corporations that discourage access through a combination of trade secret, controlled distribution of patented aromatics, and internal training schemes. As a result, this vital mode of expression has become severely limited in its scope. Nowhere is this more apparent than in representation for BIPOC and women-led companies, which are scarce, unsupported, and badly resourced.",

Participants will learn that the water challenge is winnable through smart planning and prudent investment in multi-benefit infrastructure projects like those funded by Measure W. We can do a better job of using and re-using the water we ALREADY have. We have boiled down our educational mantra to the three key easily memorable directives: Reduce – We need to cut back on the amount of water we use as a region. Reuse – We need to capture, cleanse and reuse water, such as urban runoff and stormwater. Recycle – We need to champion advanced treatment, reuse and recharging our aquifers with treated wastewater instead of dumping it into the ocean.

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We define and assess the impact of our programming by evaluating if the programs are working for the youth. Our organization frequently conduct surveys and assessments on youth and their families to determine how our Girls Club and Girl Scouts Troop program has impacted their lives. Our surveys have informed us of the youth and their family's opinions of our art programs. This has allowed us to make improvement to better serve the youth that are in underserved communities. Our assessments have informed us of youth you have academically improved and or may need academic assistance. We conduct surveys and assessments on a quarterly basis to track the activity and progress of youth that involved in our programs."

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "There is an average of approximately 30,000 foster youth in LA County. Once a foster youth ages out of foster care, many face being alone, without connections or relationships. Connections and relationships are considered part of the main foundation needed for a successful start in life. Without this foundation, foster youth face homelessness (36%), incarceration (every 1 out 4), Highschool dropouts (56%) and unemployment (51%). Within the population of foster youth, 50% identify as females and 78% are of minority decent. They will also face underrepresentation of minority women in professional occupations. Currently Black women earn 64 cents on the dollar and Latina women earn approximately 54% on the dollar in comparison to men. There has been slight improvement in the last few years and there is still a way to go regarding income equality. We have the opportunity to equip foster youth with the resources to succeed in the business sector.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Foster youth are a forgotten segment of society when it comes to business development training. There are many programs that look to support foster youth learning basic life skills. Bridges to Economic Empowerment addresses an additional need: Business and Financial Literacy. Our program focuses on creating a business foundation that consists of a working knowledge of financial concepts, how to start their own business and connections within the business community. Bridges to Economic Empowerment provides a platform for long term relationships within the business realm. It teaches foundational financial knowledge and exercises to cement the knowledge within each student. Our program then provides access to leaders in the business community creating connection and support for each participant. Bridges to Economic Empowerment will consist of a twelve month series of monthly educational workshops on financial literacy and business planning. The program will provide workshops in the community to teach foundational financial knowledge with exercises to instill the knowledge of each participant. Participants will learn how to start a business by launching their own business. Bridges to Economic Empowerment address business knowledge, professional dress/attire, emotional intelligence, relationships, access to leaders in the business community to create connections and potential internships to support the entrepreneurial or intrapreneurial goals of each participant.",

More young people will see business owners that look like them. This will encourage others to step out and go after their dream businesses or jobs. We can change the landscape of despair, to one of empowerment. People owning their power to create and grow. Whether it is opening a business or being an innovating employee, young people will know that they are valuable.

Empowering today’s foster youth who have persevered through many of life’s challenges is to teach them that true success is just often found beyond temporary defeat of what many have already faced in life. We can measure success by how many have started their own businesses, were they able to obtain summer jobs that transitioned into full time employment, or did they obtain internships that connected them with lucrative offers and working and personal relationships to be successful in their future endeavors. A successful partnership with this grant will yield success rate of a minimum of 90% in the following areas: •\tCareer planning and preparation •\tSocial and business competence •\tNetworking, building community •\tHigh School graduation",

From 2010-2019, reported crimes against street vendors in the city of Los Angeles rose nearly 337%. Latina and Indigenous youth still have some of the highest rates of domestic and sexual violence and are targets of systemic forms of oppression. The burden of of creating safe and thriving communities falls on immigrants and community members themselves since they are often criminalized by law enforcement. KLBRI partners with Los Angeles street vendors, youth serving organizations, mental health service providers, and the social justice community improving outcomes for immigrants and youth.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The goal of this project is to bolster intergenerational social and emotional connection, community safety, and well-being through an inclusive community care model rooted in healing-centered leadership development. Project THRIVE intends to shift our current ecosystem of trauma to communities that thrive. Overcoming the racial and systemic trauma that has impacted communities is a long-term process that requires multi-year funding, capacity building and healing. Project THRIVE begins to lay the foundation for creating everlasting change for impacted communities as well as those that work to support immigrants and refugees. The short term intended impact is the introduction and integration of these healing- centered practices and strategies. The intermediate impact is the building collective communities based on interconnectedness. The long term will be the implementation of these practices in organizations and communities.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "LA County is experiencing a housing and homelessness crisis. In the LA Metro Area alone, there are an estimated 647,000 tenants at-risk of being unable to pay rent. More than 80% are BIPOC. LAHSA estimates that each day some 207 people exit homelessness—but 227 others take their place. Prior to the pandemic, LA County landlords filed more than 40,000 eviction or Unlawful Detainer (UD) cases annually. This is expected to increase now that eviction protections are gone. It’s estimated tenants lose by default in 40% of cases—meaning that tenants did not file a response within five days. According UCLA’s Luskin Institute on Inequality and Democracy, “only a small proportion of tenants in eviction cases are represented by lawyers, compared to 95% of landlords.” Prevention is best way to end homelessness. Providing tenants with the tools to fight eviction is crucial to helping low-income Angelenos maintain housing and avoid homelessness.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Tenant Power Toolkit is a collaborative project between Inner City Law Center and the Debt Collective that will prevent homelessness by helping low-income tenants stay housed. The online Toolkit informs tenants of their rights, and connects them with an eviction-defense attorney - free of charge - so that they can fight eviction The project involves three components: 1. Creation, operation, and maintenance of the Tenant Power Toolkit, a web-based platform that allows tenants to file responses to eviction notices. The tool prepares not only an Answer (a defendant’s response to a legal filing) but also the paperwork necessary to obtain a Waiver of Court Fees, a Declaration of COVID-related Financial Distress, and (when appropriate) a Demand for Jury Trial. The tool electronically serves and files these legal documents. 2. An outreach and education campaign about tenants’ rights and the availability of this tool conducted through media, phone calls, texting, canvassing, community and collaborative partner meetings, and government partnerships. 3. Free, full scope representation in LA County courts. According to a 2019 STOUT study, 95% of people facing eviction who have full scope representation have a “high likelihood of avoiding disruptive displacement.” Simply put, evidence shows that full-scope legal representation is the most effective way for a tenant to avoid eviction and possible homelessness.",

The digital nature of the tool will allow the Debt Collective to receive extensive data about how tenants are interacting with the tool. We will regularly convene meetings that involve all team members to discuss evaluation data from the toolkit, outreach efforts, caseloads, and case outcomes. We will adjust the project as needed to ensure that quality is maintained and the project reaches its intended goals. We will receive and share feedback from our many community partners about the tool, including how the Toolkit can be made more accessible and more effective. ICLC eviction-defense attorneys who take on these cases will provide invaluable feedback about how the Toolkit is functioning. The successful submission of a UD answer will be deemed effective if it allows a tenant to stay in their housing long enough to link with a lawyer and local tenant organizations.",

It is shockingly common for ICLC to see clients subjected to harassment and illegal eviction attempts by landlords who want tenants out so they can increase rents. Countless more don’t reach us in time. The project will serve vulnerable, low-income people who would otherwise lack legal representation and the ability to file a response within the required five business days. Our project will help tenants avoid homelessness by informing them of their rights, providing them with a way to respond to eviction notices quickly, and connecting them to legal help they would otherwise not be able to afford. Short term, we will help low-income Angelenos at risk of eviction stay housed.

Put simply, we do not teach STEM early enough, often enough, in enough delivery modes, or equitably among girls and communities of color. Each year, we graduate thousands of non-STEM-proficient young people who will lead less fulfilling lives, feeding the ever-widening income gap which aggravates our social/racial/political divide.

Instead, we have an ever-widening income disparity gap due in part to a job market that favors more educated workers. In Los Angeles, the most diverse, most inventive city in the country, we can start to apply a more relevant way to teach STEAM and begin to reverse these troubling statistics.

Lower-income students and recent graduates cannot afford to work without compensation in order to enter creative industries. A 2021 article shared by the National Endowment for the Arts asked analyst Bonnie Nichols to review existing data on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in arts and culture industries. Data on actual staffing in these industries was sparse, but the available results were worrying: members of racial/ethnic minority groups own arts businesses at a lower rate than they own businesses in general.

    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "In our predominantly Hispanic/Latinx community, we’ve seen the disparity of arts education plague students for years. Even before COVID-19, our local schools struggled to reach the state-mandated arts curriculum requirement while wealthier schools were 40% more likely to receive funding. According to the LA County Arts Education Collective, schools with higher numbers of English learners, students of color, or low-income students receive fewer arts opportunities and lower quality instruction. There's a dearth of equitable and affordable artistic options where students who could benefit the most are getting it the least. We're located in the heart of East LA, an area that's been impacted by high crime rates (74% higher than the national average) and one of the worst COVID-19 infection rates in the nation at the peak of the pandemic. Furthermore, 19% of our region is experiencing poverty, and 92% are without a Bachelor’s degree or higher (based on adults 25 years or older).",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "The Tuition-Free Music Ensembles program directly responds to racist and classist policies that fund policing and encourage the school-to-prison pipeline while ignoring productive, artistic alternative opportunities for students to thrive. The program aims to directly combat East LA adversities without diluting or displacing the vibrancy of our community by providing weekly, free music instruction through eight ensembles including the Choir, Advanced Choir, Orchestra, Mariachi, Advanced Mariachi, Jazz, Strings and Advanced Strings. To address the systemic inequities that make lasting impact on students' academic, social and behavioral development, LAMusArt offers the Tuition-Free Music Ensembles as an affordable, equitable and accessible option for students to engage in musicianship and thus, collaboration, confidence, and creativity. The program offers instruction, rehearsals and performance weekly for 49 weeks per year and there are no barriers to join. Students are eligible for a free instrument loan if needed. Over the course of the year, 125-150 students engage in 75-100 hours of music instruction and performance annually. The program employs 10 paid Teaching Artists, and is supported by a staff of 9. The program boasts a 90% retention rate, with some students enrolled as long as eleven years.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The artistic vision that drives us is an arts ecosystem that's inclusive, diverse and equitable, and is designed to replenish and recreate productive alternatives for our community to develop themselves holistically. We believe that encouraging students to place value on arts learning, and enabling audiences to witness the arts by offering these opportunities without barriers, is imperative to a well-rounded education and the wellbeing of the community as a whole. Offering students the artistic education they've been denied is our way of diversifying the artistic landscape of Los Angeles. Our unique mix of classical chamber/choral music and Mariachi/Jazz strikes a balance between the complex and historic elements of Western and/or Eurocentric arts learning, and the cultural significance of traditional Latin/Hispanic art forms that celebrate people of color. We embrace diverse modes of pedagogy, and work to recontextualize elements of historic codes that weren't made for POC.",

The Framework, as well as the Pedagogical Understandings, were collectively created using our staff and teachers with the guidance of a facilitator. With this framework, we evaluate the development of crucial life skills each student garners with a unifying approach to arts instruction across music ensembles in the program. In addition to this evaluation method, LAMusArt assesses metrics based tracking. We measure (and document) successful outcomes by counting the number of students who come back after their initial lesson, the number of lessons given, the amount of students increasing their level of participation (joining new ensembles or adding private lessons to their learning slate) and the number of audience members at recitals."

Justice-involved youth represent some of the most under-served and marginalized populations. Boys and girls of color (ages 13 through 18) are vastly over-represented within LA County’s juvenile justice system. A common thread among the system-engaged children TAGYP work with is early childhood abuse and trauma. As a result, many of them engage in impulsive, risk-taking behavior and substance abuse. In the beginning of the workshop, many TAGYP participants are skeptical and have had life experiences which have taught them not to trust people in authority or those that do not come from the same background. Communication in general and writing in particular are stress points.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "For more than six years, TAGYP has provided direct arts services to Los Angeles County youth in the juvenile justice system. TAGYP offers ensemble theater as a tool for behavioral transformation and rehabilitation and utilizes the documented power of the arts to re-imagine ways to engage with and support children who are currently incarcerated. TAGYP collaborates with Arts for Healing and Justice Network (AHJN) and Los Angeles County Probation (LACP) for permission and clearance to deliver 10-13-week programs. TAGYP attempts to break the generational and cyclical issues associated with youth incarceration. Workshop participants are introduced to ensemble work, heightened play in four fundamental states of emotion (happy, sad, afraid, and angry), and to 14 archetypal characters of the Commedia dell’Arte. This ancient form of theater - which is the shared vocabulary of TAG - serves as a vehicle for safe exploration. Most of the Teaching Artists (TAs) are Prison Project Alumni. This common ground lays a foundation for trust and vulnerability necessary to explore and play. The TAs inform participants that they are partners in this work, they don't have all the answers, and they will \"figure it together,\" as peers. TAs ask participants what they need to feel safe, to participate, to feel respect, and to have fun. The answers turn into the “agreement” and becomes the group's guide to which everyone will be held for the duration of the program.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The vision for TAGYP moving forward is to introduce a mentoring element to the current programming. Mentoring will take place at youth facilities and at TAG's Ivy Substation when possible and appropriate. TAGYP will provide 10-week sessions of alumni-led programming for participants. The weekly classes will be 75% alumni-led ensuring participants have access to mentors with lived experience. Alumni TA’s will facilitate classes, track attendance, and create observational reports for each class. Participants engage in this profound emotional exploration through agreements, mindful sharing, theatrical games and exercises, relaxation, writing, improvisation, and TAG Style work. By the end of each session, participants will develop emotional awareness and expression, communication skills, team building skills, and self-confidence which will assist in educational ambitions and/or obtaining employment.",

These seedlings will be specially cultivated to thrive in Los Angeles' climate in an outdoor urban setting, while also honoring the unique cultural heritage of our region's agricultural history. This will include indigenous and native plants, popular staples from the time in the early 20th century when Los Angeles was the top producing County in the country, to present day reflection of our communities' demographics. By choosing to make this mobile, the project not only reduces overhead and transaction costs, but enables built-in distribution and ease of participation in local farmer's markets, events, and community pop-ups. We can serve a wide radius covering South LA, Central LA, and East LA, which is home to an increasing number of urban farms, but lacks a reliable seedling supplier. As added value, the Seed Shuttle can operate as an educational and workshop tool for schools, conferences, and other event opportunities.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Urban agriculture is growing rapidly, providing myriad benefits ranging from increasing food security to climate resilience. In Los Angeles, there are currently over 200 urban farming sites, largely operating uniquely and independently. Crop Swap LA fully believes in the transformative power of urban agriculture, and is committed to supporting this continued growth in a healthy, sustainable way. Tackling this supply chain issue in the South LA communities we live and work in helps ensure this opportunity is available to everyone, minimizing a key barrier to entry. Satellite heat mapping and dedicated studies have indicated low-income neighborhoods and underserved communities average almost 10 degrees hotter than more affluent areas of the City, largely due to the lack of green spaces. This is in addition to these areas' status as food deserts, lacking quality food and nutrition options. Expanded support for urban agriculture in these areas helps solve for both.",

More broadly, fruit and vegetable seed genetic diversity has plummeted over 90% in the last 200 years as a result of industrialized agriculture. This lack of diversity in food production translates to a lack of adaptability, a large challenge in the face of rapidly changing climate and growing conditions. This is most salient in the form of the ongoing megadrought plaguing California, causing agriculture operations to reassess or stop growing altogether. Drought tolerant vegetables, particularly those in the crucifer family (Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, kale, kohlrabi, mustard, broccoli, turnips and watercress) do very well growing in Los Angeles.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Legacy LA will train and engage 40 youth leaders to continue the campaign for the Ramona Gardens Natural Park. Once built, the Park will serve as an anti-pollution green buffer to reduce the impact of air pollution from the Interstate-10 Highway adjacent to Ramona Gardens. Legacy LA youth began this campaign by conducting environmental studies on air quality (2016); and conceptualizing a Natural Park to mitigate air pollution. Youth engaged 500 community residents, who provided input on park design. The Park campaign is now in the design development phase including obtaining environmental clearances. A technical team prepared reports on the conceptual plan, schematic design, and air pollution reduction measures. With the LA2050 grant, Legacy LA will build a new cohort of youth leaders to advance the Park campaign and enhance community capacity to address emerging environmental issues. Legacy LA will provide 40 youth with 80 hours of leadership and environmental justice training over 8-10 months including (a) 30 workshops, 2 hours each, on leadership, environmental justice, and how to engage stakeholders, public agencies, and elected officials; and (b) Youth Leaders in Action meetings focused on environmental justice and Park campaign updates. Youth will update residents on the Park campaign through community and house meetings. Youth will plan and facilitate a culminating town hall meeting for community, elected officials, and environmental justice organizations.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The proposed project will advance environmental justice in a low-income primarily Latino community in Boyle Heights. Forty youth will participate in 80 hours of leadership and environmental justice programming, and help advance the campaign for the Natural Park. Youth will engage community residents, elected officials, and environmental justice organizations, resulting in the adoption of a Community Plan to build the Park. A key project outcome will be enhanced community capacity to address emerging environmental justice issues, promoting youth participation in civic life and local decision-making. Once built, the Park will serve as an anti-pollution green buffer to reduce the impact of air pollution from the adjacent Interstate-10 Highway. The Park will help protect 2,000 low-income, primarily Latino residents from chronic health conditions due to transit-related air pollution, while providing green space for play and fitness, restoring native habitat, and recycling stormwater.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 40",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "Air quality in Ramona Gardens (in northern Boyle Heights) is among the worst statewide, according to a CalEnviroScreen map, due to transit pollution. The 15-lane Interstate-10 Highway, El Monte busway, and Metrolink rail line are immediately adjacent to Ramona Gardens. Per US Census data, 37.7% of families in the area have income below poverty & 86.5% of residents identify as Latino (zip code 90033, census tracts 2031 and 2033). In comparison, those figures are 14.3% and 48.2%, respectively, countywide. Research from UCLA shows “Black, Latino, Asian American and low-income communities are exposed to substantially more air pollution than other demographic groups in California”. “Long-term exposure to air pollution related to traffic is associated with elevated rates of coronary heart disease, hospitalization and death” (Jocelyn Apodaca Schlossberg with Dr. Lara Cushing, “Air Pollution: A Health Equity Issue”, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, November 2021).",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "East LA",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Legacy LA measures impact at the community and individual level. At the community level, youth leaders conceptualized the Natural Park campaign and successfully outreached to 500 residents to gather input on park design. As a result, the community now has a resident-driven design for a Natural Park including features that will reduce air pollution, increase green space, and provide play and fitness areas. At the individual level, Legacy LA has trained 40-60 youth/year in leadership skills and environmental justice over the past three years. In 2020-2021, 89% of youth agreed “I have learned about the benefits of the Natural Park Anti-Pollution Solution”. In prior years, Legacy LA youth leaders successfully advocated for installation of a $400,000 air filtration system to improve student health at Murchison Elementary School. Jacky Rodriguez, Legacy LA program alumna and staff, was appointed to the Air Quality Management District Community Steering Committee for East LA."

VCH has recently started moving into new neighborhoods within the county of Los Angeles. To support these efforts, staff have developed a thorough community engagement process that begins with local relationship building. Currently, VCH is partnering with Santa Monica Community Corporation, Liberty Community Land Trust, and Downtown Crenshaw on three of its new projects. These organizations have been active in their respective neighborhoods for years, and their teams have provided valuable background information and introductions to community stakeholders. In addition to developing formal partnerships, VCH’s staff performs extensive neighborhood outreach, hosts community events, and solicits local design feedback during each step of the development process. This ensures that neighbors and impacted community members are involved in decision-making and see their needs reflected throughout the building’s creation. When complete, each development should honor the neighborhood’s existing identity and culture. VCH’s Community Design Manager and Community Engagement Coordinator oversee this work, but all staff contribute in unique ways, from assisting with local networking to knocking on doors and facilitating community listening sessions.",

VCH also recently broke ground on Journey Apartments (40 units) and is in various stages of pre-development for additional projects in Venice, Santa Monica, Crenshaw, South LA, and unincorporated LA County. To move these projects forward, VCH has activated its base of tenants, unhoused and housed neighbors, and community organizers. VCH facilitated over 100 large and small-scale meetings in a three-year period where Venice residents familiarized themselves with key policies and became educated supporters. As a result, approximately 2,227 individuals have mobilized in support of four of VCH’s projects over the last two years. In July 2021, VCH was named a 2021 American Institute of Architects Los Angeles Presidential Honoree."

Industries like fashion and manufacturing can help alleviate that pressure by creating opportunities, jobs and careers. Much of that process starts with youth. We have begun hosting and offering classes to young people who are interested in fashion in order to offer a forum where people can bring their creative ideas, learn how to bring them to fruition in the form of a real product, and even learn the basics of bringing the product to market. LA also has creative minds currently in the workforce trying to bring their ideas to market. These people need a support structure that can offer them know how, tools and strategic opportunities to test their products, all in one place.

We have identified the need to support young and creative people with real talent and huge potential, to create products/brands that can have an economic impact both on the jobs market and the fashion market. The problem identified is a lack of opportunity and support to grow ideas and help bring them to market. We know the need is there because we've talked to young people in the profession, we've helped launch two startups and we are currently helping professors who want to bring the resources of La La land to current students. We will measure success by the number of creative startups we enable with support from conceptualization to sample development, corrections, market testing and finally market offering. This process entails many steps that involve not just creativity but business planning, financial forecasting, market research and finally industry trade familiarity."

STEM programming is an exceptional way to help students achieve academic success, ultimately setting themselves up for improved career and economic outcomes after graduation from high school. In fact, data has shown that STEM encourages critical thinking, makes other subjects in school more exciting, promotes an entrepreneurial spirit, and paves a way for future economic stability (Science Explorers, 2021). Additionally, when coupled with physical activity, sports, and social-emotional learning principles, STEM is less intimidating and students feel higher levels of excitement around STEM concepts (Underwood, 2021). On average, those who enter STEM fields make 26% more than their non-STEM peers (WPU, Accessed 6/12/22).",

The Outkast Academy heavily believes in collaboration and since our founding, we have prioritized partnering with various grade schools across the city who lack arts education and funding for arts-based extracurricular activities. By hiring more teaching artists, we increase our organization’s margin to impact more schools and therefore, more students. Our vision is to play a small part in making the arts more accessible to youth who otherwise would not have the opportunity to. We believe this internship will create many more Los Angeles artists who seek to make our city a better place for all.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We first measure the impact of our internship by taking into account how many students successfully complete the program. Our internship is very similar to what the position of a fully-hired Teaching Artist entails. Therefore, once our youth complete our internship and our team finishes up evaluations, we get a clear picture of whether or not this position is fit for them. As of 2022, 100% of our current Teaching Artists have all expressed that if it were not for participating in our programs and completing our internship, they would have pursued careers completely different from the arts.

This internship has given many students the opportunity to train with our team of professional artists to learn the ins and outs of teaching dance, choreographing work, helping youth build their creative abilities, and assisting in classes to work personally with students. The internship consists of a leadership curriculum that emphasizes the importance of work ethic, professionalism, communication, problem-solving, and adapting to a team. It also consists of rigorous physical training in order for interns to feel comfortable teaching dance, switching up teaching methods and strategies, and creating work that is both physically demanding yet meaningful. We take pride that this internship is available to students who participate in our programs, on-site and off-site at our partnering schools, and is completely free. Upon completing our internship and evaluations, they are offered an employment opportunity to work with our organization as Assistant Instructors to continue their training while receiving a paid position. Overall, our internship program is available for youth to help them decide whether the arts is what they desire to pursue professionally while allowing them to gain the skills necessary to succeed as teaching artists.",

On average, 85% of our students are meeting or exceeding grade level standards, compared to only 43% of LAUSD students. Additionally, nearly 80% of students return to our program each summer, building upon their academic and social-emotional achievements year after year. We also utilize surveys to measure scholars’ self-confidence and feelings toward reading and learning. Not only do we want scholars to learn from our program, but we want scholars to enjoy reading and learning.

Students from low-income backgrounds lose more than 2 months in reading and 2-3 months of math achievement, while their peers from middle-class households make slight gains. The disadvantage is cumulative; by the fifth grade, lower income youth may fall more than 2 years behind their more affluent peers. The pandemic has exacerbated the achievement gap, materially affecting Black and Latino students—the students served by our program. Current research demonstrates that frequent, intensive tutoring, like our programs, is one of the most effective ways to help students make up for academic gaps.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative this grant will support to address the issue.": "Success Stories Program is an alternative to prisons that builds safer communities by delivering feminist programming to people who have caused harm. We are proposing to bring our 12-week program to 2 LAUSD schools with the hope that long-term we will scale out to become a resource across the district. Since its founding in 2014, SSP has been an impactful vehicle for transformation and long term change and has supported over 2000, mostly incarcerated people, to address harmful beliefs about power, relationships and violence. Our program has also shifted culture in middle and high schools by addressing beliefs and patterns that can lead to suspension, expulsions and imprisonment. Our model centers the unlearning of destructive behaviors rooted in patriarchy and focuses on the building of new patterns around love and responsibility. Participants identify their top 5 most important people and goals and explore whether their actions and behavior serve it. This happens through a “Relate – Investigate – Recreate” model where facilitators relate to participants by sharing how they’ve personally dealt with or deal with similar thoughts and behaviors, while challenging students to investigate how these beliefs harm themselves and others and then support them in creating new perspectives and plans of action. This is all done in a safe environment where vulnerability and accountability are modeled, practiced and students bond peer-to-peer and with relatable adults (facilitators).",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "The school-to-prison pipeline is the process that pushes students into the criminal legal system through policies and practices that punish maladaptive behavior with suspensions, expulsions and juvenile court referrals. Once suspended or expelled, students become three times more likely to end up in the juvenile system within a year, and are 67% more likely to be incarcerated before age 25. The most common reasons cited for suspension are physical and verbal aggression and insubordination (Burker and Nishioka, 2014). Punitive measures isolate and stigmatize young people rather than offering them alternative ways to deal with complex emotions and social dynamics.This deepens trauma responses that lead to cycles of community, interpersonal and gang violence and ultimately incarceration. Young folks get stolen from their communities and put in cages at alarming rates resulting in Los Angeles County being one of the most carceral places in the country.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We are currently running our 12-week program at University Middle School and Oakland Technical High School. The program has proven to resonate with students and successfully equip them with alternative tools to navigate complex situations. For instance, one of the participants was in conflict with another student, and instead of handling it by fighting, the student reached out to one of the SSP facilitators and talked through some of the things learned in the program and then was able to handle the situation in a non-violent way. In expanding our programming into LA County schools, we expect similar positive outcomes. We expect to see a decrease in the number of suspensions and expulsions related to physical and verbal aggression and insubordination, as well as an increase in faculty reports of positive behavior. Our research team will analyze pre and post participant surveys that measure qualitative and quantitative impact, interview faculty and students and debrief with facilitators.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We envision a thriving LA County that uses models of accountability and belonging instead of suspensions and expulsions to address misbehavior in schools. Adolescence (ages 10-19) is a critical time in human development that sets the stage for long-term outcomes. During this time, young people learn a lot about themselves and the world around them. It is crucial that they receive positive messaging about who they are and what is expected of them so that they go on to become positive members of their communities. With LA County having the second largest school system in the nation, there’s a huge opportunity to be a leading example of how healthy, happy communities are made by supporting adolescent development. SSP is an innovative, impactful way to support this development as the model nurtures transformation by equipping students with healthy ways to deal with relationship building, conflict and self management while connecting with fellow students and the facilitators."

Black women want the best for their families and work tirelessly to provide for them financially. Limited time, low earnings, and savings levels foster an elevated need for resources and ways to help their families advance. Local policies cause obstacles rather than pathways for racial equity. Single parent family structure and aging parents cause undue childcare burdens. Many engage in business ventures to bolster their income, accounting for the dramatic increases in Black led female-owned businesses over the past few years.

Expert speakers or incredible individual volunteers come into the classroom to discuss these topics in further detail. Individuals go over real world experiences and scenarios to help bring the information to life so that students have a better understanding of what they are going to face once they graduate. During the presentation, students engage in team-based critical thinking activities to connect their own environment. The last five years we’ve run our program in after school programs and realized our program is more impactful inside the high school. Therefore, we emphasize working directly with students during school hours.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In running our program, we will be evaluating the short-term success of students based on their performance through their quizzes and test scores. We can also keep track of attendance and record participation to gather data to analyze the effectiveness of our program. Our underlying goal for these students is to ensure that they have a better understanding of the weight of their financial decisions as they leave high school and become adults. In the long-term, we will evaluate long term success with our students executing a better blueprint for their future financial and career decisions. This means that students are going to the right schools rather than to the ones that are more prestigious, accessing scholarships/grants to graduate debt-free, using their degrees when they enter the workforce, and not falling into financial distress as adults. Our city and state will prosper if students are given the chance to grow as the wealth and opportunity gaps drop.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We see Los Angeles County looking like a place that all students would want to stay, grow their lives, and be proud to call themselves Angelenos. Students who once were in our program will leave with an abundance of knowledge to make better financial decisions not only for their lives, but for everyone around them. We see our former students returning and becoming helpful interns or volunteers for our programs' younger generations. Our program will also result in more Los Angeles students giving back to their communities, pursuing the proper degrees so they can enter the workforce right after college, less student loan debt, less individuals falling into homelessness, and lastly, but most importantly, ending the cycle of poverty which has plagued our great city. Our program will also make LA County a safer place because the students will gravitate towards legal activities because they will have the help, resources, and the incentives they need to stay away from illegal activities.",
    "What is the primary issue area that your application will impact?": "K-12 STEAM Education",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 710,000",
    "What is your understanding of the issue that you are seeking to address?": "BBFK is seeking to eliminate generational poverty within underrepresented communities. People living within these communities are affected by certain determinant factors: Socioeconomic status, environment, and race. Having financial issues, lacking access to resources, and facing discrimination, plays a part in pre-determining the type of future the younger generation will have. These are roadblocks that hinder the true potential of high school students who easily become dropouts, criminals, unemployed, and impoverished. Although students are given the opportunity to go to school, they are not properly advised on what resources they can take advantage of to improve and excel both academically and socially. Essentially, high school students are not presented with enough options to succeed in life and we know this when around 70% of college graduates are not using their bachelor degree when they enter the workforce."
