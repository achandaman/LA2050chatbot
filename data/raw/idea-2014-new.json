    "goal": "LEARN",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The two greatest lessons that propelled me build the FLY Yoga Arts program, and in proposing the program to LA2050 are: First, I have learned there is a formula for every child to learn, thrive and reach their highest potential. Whether a child excels most through creativity, physical games or complex puzzles, the thing every child has in common is their need to play and create. This realization led me to action- we must bring our right-brain gifts of abstract thinking and connection back to education.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "FLY is already partnered with many LAUSD schools through LA’s BEST Enrichment Program. This program provides the staff, the schools, the students and the system to bring our tools to the masses!",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The first foreseeable barrier will be placing the FLY program into immediate effect. Since we will not know if we’ve received the award till the end of September, much of our preparation time will be cut short, as schools are already in full swing starting early August.",

    "goal": "LIVE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This project will benefit the larger population of Los Angeles. By improving our efforts to increase our local water supply and reduce our water consumption at the neighborhood scale (as well as the city scale), we can work towards obtaining water security for the city as we grow in the coming decades.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "This proposal seeks to address issues related to drought by creating a digital platform (app & website) that will increase the public’ s awareness about water-related projects throughout the city and encourage them to get involved. The platform will use interactive mapping to geolocate projects throughout the city as well as priority areas for new projects to occur. It will help users find opportunities to connect with, volunteer for, or donate to current projects as well as allow them to propose future water-related projects to get community support. By increasing transparency and promoting awareness, this tool will provide incentives for citizens to become active in larger-scale water conservation projects to help fight the drought.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "I. Develop the Digital Platform using open source GIS data as well as research and mapping already in progress.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Mia Lehrer + Associates: Project management, project inventory and mapping, civic engagement,",

    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "- Amount of contributions volunteers and dontations",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "We have seen lots of organizations work to help solve this problem, but they often act in silos. We have learned that the best way to tackle large-scale problems is by working as strong communities. We hope that this project will help strengthen the large network of people and organizations working to solve this water crisis.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The test pilot is achievable as Arid Lands Institute (ALI) already is very active in the San Fernando Valley. ALI has already done a lot of research on water related efforts in the community and has a large network of community partners in the area. We will be building on the knowledge and connections of water related organization in both private and public sectors. Both MLA and ALI have a background in mapping and creating powerful graphics to show environmental issues in a clear, informative and evocative manner. Within the next 12 months, we feel confident we can build a prototype for the platform, find participants in the San Fernando Valley, test and evaluate the program, and finally work to make improvements on the app. We hope to find future funding to expand this program to the larger metropolitan area in the future.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "ML+A promotes the practice of designing innovative landscapes while building healthy environments and sustainable communities.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Drought has always been a significant problem for Los Angeles, but this problem will only be exacerbated over the next few decades without a major intervention. By 2050, LA’s population is projected to increase to 40 million, placing a much bigger demand on an already minimal supply. In addition, climate change is expected to reduce the snowpack in Sierra Nevada by 25%, which is a key contributor to LA’s water reservoirs. LA currently imports 85% of its water. As population increases, we need to improve our efforts increase our local supply of water so we can be closer to water independence.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "This app will help LA increase our local water supply and conserve water by assisting landscape improvement projects and other conservation efforts. This will help increase the amount of open space, improving water AND air quality, providing increased wildlife habitat throughout the city. Through a more networked community, this app will promote awareness, education, volunteerism and support. Ultimately, this will help create a more resilient and healthy Los Angeles."

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "South LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The vision driving our Center for Sustainable Communities involves a broad spectrum of issues, and at the center of this focus is the need to pursue sustainability and help create resilient neighborhoods. Tying employment, housing, place, business, and lifestyle is critical to building sustainability, and the Center will serve as a catalyst for achieving broader community and personal empowerment goals that will help low income families in South LA most adversely impacted by economic divestment.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Utilizing the community development model of \"What Makes Community?\" as our planning paradigm, NHS is working with the City of Compton, Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation, and Metro CDC to create the first of several Centers for Sustainable Communities in South LA. The CSC will offer community resources for low-to-moderate income families in Compton deal with impacts of economic divestiture by serving as a hub to provide information and access to resources that make communities stronger and more resilient. Residents and businesses will tap a range of services related to housing, transit, economic development, environmental stewardship, job training, skills development, urban agriculture, and healthy living.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Center will serve hundreds of low income families in a region that has endured many of the worst impacts of the economic downturn and decades of blight. NHS has a long and very successful history of serving low-to-moderate income neighborhoods. For 30 years, 90% of our client base has been low income families residing in the poorest and most neglected neighborhoods of LA County. In 2013, 95% of the people we help were considered low income and 84% were ethnic minorities.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Specific benchmarks for the Center and its services include:",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "NHS secured the Center property in March 2014 and has formalized agreements with six critical partners (PCR, Metro CDC, LA Conservation Corps, the LA County Department of Health, HUD, and the City of Compton). All architectural specs and permits have been completed to move the project into the primary phase of repurposing the facility. We are now in the process of renovating and upgrading the building to accommodate tenants. Funding to complete the renovation and construction phase is in hand and it is expected we will house initial tenants by late summer 2014 with full tenancy by the end of 2014 if possible. At least 50% of the tenants in the CSC facility will be service-driven. Given that the community has endured an abandoned and neglected 28,000 sq ft building for the past nine years, NHS feels obligated to open the facility and establish community services as soon as possible.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Though we have adequate funds in hand to meet our initial costs for launching the Center, securing an ongoing source of sustainable funding and investment commitments to maintain the facility over the first five years of operation will be a challenge. Our primary focus over the first phase of our launch (Sept 2014 - Dec 2014) will include locking up the necessary number of non-profit service and commercial tenants for the Center as well as continuing to leverage funds through the City of Compton, CDCs, regional financing partners, and community lending organizations to ensure viability through 2015 and beyond.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Achieving sustainability and building resilient neighborhoods in traditionally blighted and neglected communities requires creating and sharing tools that will help residents and business come together to fulfill their vision for the community. Resident buy-in and engaging beneficiaries and stakeholders in the planning and evolution of programs like the CSC are absolutely crucial.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "As low income communities in South LA continue to struggle with ongoing blight and work towards long-term neighborhood revitalization, the focus becomes how to help reverse the significant environmental, social, health, and economic impacts of long term divestment on residents and families. Of primary concern is how to deal with the growing challenges among these neighborhoods regarding chronic unemployment/underemployment, reduced capital access for small business development, the ongoing threat of food insecurity, substandard transit options, skyrocketing housing costs, educational disparities, and youth disengagement. Decades of studies confirm that these problems disproportionately affect underserved and impoverished communities. For example, the current surge in home purchase and rental costs means housing now consumes over 65% of average median income on average in LMI communities. Add to that consistently high unemployment (15%), a nearly 3 to 1 ratio in loan denial rates, and limited access to mass transit and healthy food - which has been proven to impact employment and educational performance – and the need for greater resources to meet basic economic demands and achieve a moderate living standard becomes evident.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "NHS has entered into agreements with the City of Compton, METRO CDC, and the Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation as primary partners and is formalizing arrangements with the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, the LA County Department of Health, the LA Food Policy Council, Community Services Unlimited, and the Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Empowerment to provide expertise, customized services, training opportunities, and cross-collaborative projects through the Center.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our expected outcomes will make a vital difference for families and small businesses looking to create new job training options in multiple fields, improve personal and community health, and expand sustainable economic opportunity in South LA/Compton. We will help rebuild neighborhoods with programs that keep teens active and healthy and where people coming out of prison can build marketable skills and avoid reincarceration. Center services will provide flexible capital for small business, expand affordable lending for families, and fund business incubators in targeted neighborhoods. Over the first two years the Center will strive to increase the number of minority- and women-owned firms by 20%; provide training, credit education, and finance options to create and support the expansion of 50 local startups; and stimulate direct venture capital investment through lending partnerships. The Homeownership Center will create equity and build affordable homeownership opportunities for families by 30%."

Now, LA has the opportunity to develop a model of ‘conscientious development’ where artists, developers and residents work together to maintain the authenticity of what makes a neighborhood wonderful, while building new housing and commercial opportunity.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Working with RAC Design Build we are about to what space is available. The custom RV is to be built with local Frogtown business ‘The Happier Camper.’ Beyond being a fantastic neighborhood business, they are at the bleeding edge of creating the most sustainable recreational vehicles anywhere in the world. Ultralight modern materials, crafted in Los Angeles, mean that there is no need for a large truck to transport the trailer, eliminating huge vehicle and fuel costs. Propane tanks are being replaced by solar powered generators. This allows R5Y7: bici destino to operate completely off the power grid without purchasing - or consuming - environmentally damaging fuels. Lights, sound and computers will all work like any other modern space. The usually heavy tasks of hitching the trailer, installation, maintenance and hauling are light and easy enough for usually timid women to handle confidently. We will not need power, water or sewer hook ups making the cost of getting started and operating significantly lower. Our neighbors have offered to be the go-to restroom for any volunteers/staff. For any parties or larger events, port-a-potties would need to be temporarily installed.",

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "R5Y7: a bicycle gallery at 4357 Melrose Avenue in the East Hollywood neighborhood existed from December 2012 – December 2013. Everything from the learning the response to different kinds of art, demonstrated interest in certain workshops and the infinite details in how to successfully promote and develop attendance was a tremendous learning experience. Beyond the creative, social or technical aspects of running the gallery, the financial side was a very serious lesson in exactly how little money was needed to still pull off quality programing while keeping the lights on.",

    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "A solar powered vintage trailer 'pop up' bike shop, education venue and urban retreat.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "A “Pop up” or temporary bike shop & gallery will encourage people to bicycle along the LA river bike path from areas far outside the immediate neighborhood. Through workshops and signage we can reduce the number of collisions between walkers and cyclists – people passing through the neighborhood versus residents. By utilizing a custom vintage style trailer, we’re able to delight the imagination attract artist and design enthusiasts, or simply anyone who loves beautiful outdoor experiences along the LA River. LA City sponsored plans call for art installations, garden projects, infrastructure improvements – but none have included bicycles. That’s crazy!",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Bicycles & Art make life better. R5Y7: bici destino provides the on the ground logistical support to get communities living and moving together, while encouraging individual creativity and ambition. Facilitating a ‘car free’ or ‘car lite’ lifestyle means that individuals have more money and time to develop ideas and relationships.",

    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Trailer: The highly modular and completely custom 16’ fiberglass trailer is currently in development under the Happier Camper. First production run is scheduled for October 2014. Even with delays and extensive custom work, the R5Y7: bici destino unit will be ready by February, 2015. While the creation of the trailer itself has a complex manufacturing process, it save us in other ways: from not having to handle serious infrastructure work to not needing to transport heavy items across long distances with large, powerful (expensive!) trucks."

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Beauty Bus Foundation brings beauty home to chronically or terminally ill individuals and their caregivers. For the past five years, Beauty Bus volunteers have provided so many moments of hope and respite to clients and caregivers. It is now time to create the optimal volunteer experience. Every aspect of our three core programs (In-Home Visits, Pop-Up Salons and Bag of Beauty) depend on the time and commitment of our trained volunteers. We do not exist without them. By streamlining our system and minimizing any barrier to entry – this will ensure that we can capture potential volunteer excitement and convert them to volunteers quickly. Resulting in an increase in the number of clients, services and bags we deliver.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "After five years we recognize that our volunteers come to Beauty Bus because they are drawn to our mission. It is time to create a volunteer program that is easy to use and in line with how so many are already scheduling their time. Currently, the In-Home Program centers on the date requested by the patient/caregiver and can be long for both staff and volunteers.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "In addition to our clients, Beauty Bus develops a deep and mutually beneficial relationship with our volunteers. The interaction that takes place on a Beauty Bus Foundation visit is unique. Clients and volunteers develop new perspectives about what living with a chronic or terminal illness looks like. The subtle change that happens is raising social awareness about the populations we serve. Our volunteers are changing their community as they work toward a more inclusive society focused on opportunity for those caring for and living with a chronic or terminal condition. Since our founding we have seen 5,000 clients, provided 4,000 services and delivered 16,000 bags. And we have only begun to scratch the surface of the nearly 50,000 Angelenos living with chronic or terminal conditions, who qualify for our services. Success in 2050 would mean that Beauty Bus is an integrated part of the pallative care services that hospital and social service agencies recommend to clients and caregivers across Los Angeles County. Perhaps our most profound accomplishment is in generating connection and the show of support in the forms of referrals we receive from those in the healthcare fields. Nurses, doctors and social workers are telling their patients and families about Beauty Bus because they have seen first hand the powerful transformation that comes from the human interaction during a hair cut or a manicure.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "When we started Beauty Bus, it was clear to us that, disease does not discriminate. We see a gap between \"quality of care\" and \"quality of life.\" It is in this gap that we work.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The outcome of Beauty Bus services is highly intangible. We rely on both quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate and measure the impact our programs have on the clients, caregivers, their families, volunteers and the larger community.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By streamlining the volunteer application and training process and creating an online scheduling system that meets the needs of those providing services and support, we will increase the rate of volunteerism and create and publicize real time volunteer opportunities, creating an outlet for Angelenos to volunteer informally. More volunteers engaging with the chronically and terminally ill, along with Beauty Bus becoming an integral and referred service within the healthcare community will increase the social and emotional support of residents. We service a cross section of the community and already have volunteers and clients moving across traditional residential boundaries. With civic minded volunteers, there will be more voices advocating for the needs of those in their community.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "At this point in our organizational growth, we will need to automate a certain aspect of our program or hire more staff to meet the demands of scheduling. We are committed to being an organization that is available and accessible to our clients and volunteers. With our limited resources, we find that moving to a system that allows us to work more in line with how people are living and scheduling their lives we will better manage future growth.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "This project touches upon many localized quality of life virtues including education, health, social connectivity, creativity, cultural vitality, and microeconomics. This workforce development initiative is tasked to design and build four site-specific constructs for growing food in South LA. It includes hands-on teaching, internships, small business accounting, and incubation support to culinary students working with restaurants. The curriculum will assess various logistics including economic potential, environmental factoring, and collective social impact, while determining the feasibility of urban ag applications on rooftops and on vacant lots. The information gathered from this process will be made available to the public for free.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our chosen goal is ushering life into a healthier LA, by promoting “food economy that promotes wellness and health” by converting existing sites into chemical-free urban farms that serve as agricultural and culinary learning centers as well as activity space. Community stakeholders will have increased access to localized organic food sources while engaging with others whom enjoy growing and creating as much as they do.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The first lesson which has informed our project is that the production of food and the way we deal with food through processed foods and fast food restaurants is not sustainable and has led to unhealthy communities, as seen in the increased rates of obesity, and needs to be addressed in a lifestyle change.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Many urban areas in Central and South Los Angeles do not have sufficient access to groceries stores, yet are overrun with fast food eateries and convenience/liquor stores. Their choices of diet are limited and it is difficult, costly, and time consuming to obtain wholesome fruits and vegetables. There is a growing plague of obesity and diabetes in America and other countries that have adopted the habit of relying on the dominance of pre-prepared foods. Overworked mothers often do not have the choice of feeding their families plant, fruit, enzyme and mineral rich, traditional meals. Half the nutrition in vegetables is lost within a day of being picked. Urban agriculture would provide these families with choices, develop a deeper understanding of health, and offer the joy of a living and growing relationship to our source of nutrition, in these concrete landscape environments. Additionally, the potential for personal and public savings on healthcare, a community that encourages better decisions through hands on lessons in cultivating life, and the possibility of entrepreneurial endeavors would only serve to benefit us all.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The biggest challenges are to institutionalize the program and to provide an easily accessible and understandable transparent allocation of funds. The good news is that our College and District are moving towards open government and transparency in all their procedures, and our new President Larry Frank is very supportive of innovative thinking, local workforces, and improving students' quality of life.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Griffith Observatory is unique among Los Angeles institutions as a place where a broad range of demographic audiences, including students and adult lifelong learners, may be inspired by interesting, accurate scientific information in a state-of-the art immersive environment. This kind of inspiration may motivate people to take the next step, stay in school, major in math, or complete that degree to get the job they want. Plus there is a “community contribution.” Certainly the exposure to cosmic perspective often influences everyday decision making to be our best.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The planetarium show already has a treatment and is ready to go to the story board phase. Testing animations of key scenes is underway. Animators skilled in specific areas of visualizations are being interviewed. The new projection system and components are close to being specified. Fundraising for the necessary equipment is underway. All these elements point to a re-imagined school planetarium show being ready by the end of 2015 with the premiere of the new show to follow.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The first major challenge is to negotiate a working relationship with the City of Los Angeles' technology department. The computers, software, render farm, etc. required to produce a planetarium show reflecting Griffith Observatory's standards of excellence must be operated and maintained by knowledgeable people. Key members of Observatory, FOTO, and Department of Recreation and Parks management are working together to devise a plan to ensure that this expertise is in place for the full duration of show development.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "Our national economic prosperity and security require that the USA be a world leader in science and technology. We must develop the ideas to transform and strengthen the economy, ensure a skilled workforce for American industry, and guarantee that American students have access to the educational resources and tools necessary to fully participate in the science- and technology-based economy of the 21st century. According to the National Science Board, the earlier children are exposed to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) concepts, the more likely they are to be comfortable with them later in life. Improving the extent and quality of elementary STEM education should be a priority. But in California, students in elementary school have less than 15 minutes of science a day on average.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The only confirmed collaboration at this point is with the Fiske Planetarium at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Fiske already has installed the 8K planetarium dome projection system we will be purchasing. Until the Observatory system is purchased and installed, Fiske has agreed to let our graphics team view their work on the Fiske dome in exchange for being able to perform our new life in the universe show live in Boulder after it premieres in Los Angeles.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Informal learning experiences such as planetarium shows inspire the future, one imagination at a time by motivating students and lifelong learners to go out and read a book, ask a question, or stay in school.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "First, the literature and teacher feedback support Griffith Observatory's focus on the importance of informal learning experiences. The way to have the broadest impact is through a planetarium show.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Friends Of The Observatory is seeking funds to create programs and experiences in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium that will help to bridge the gaps that exist in formal learning by providing a variety of informal learning experiences that are accessible to children, youth, and families in an environment that is inclusive and inspiring to lifelong learning. Planetarium shows provide a cosmic perspective for our audiences. Cosmic perspective inspires the asking of big questions about who we are and what we think about ourselves and the rest of the world. It can have a positive effect on our choices and behavior. Thus, the knowledge and information shaping imaginations at Griffith Observatory is actually shaping future lives and culture.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Funding from LA2050 will be used to hire animators and special consultants required to create the thrilling visuals that inspire cosmic perspective in our audiences. These technical experts will enable Griffith Observatory’s graphic staff to re-imagine the School Field Trip planetarium show, Water is Life, and to create a brand new planetarium show on the intriguing, popular topic of life in the universe.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Over 300,000 visitors, not only from the greater Los Angeles region but also from around the world, see a planetarium show at Griffith Observatory each year. A visitor survey identified a demographic profile almost identical to the State of California: 43% Caucasian; 36% Hispanic; 9% Asian American; and 6% African American. Underserved audiences make up nearly half of the Observatory's visitor base.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The best way to judge the success of a planetarium show is through qualitative measurements that capture audience attitudes. For example, anecdotal research tells us that many of the scientists and engineers now working at JPL were first inspired by a visit to Griffith Observatory. Also, fifth grade school teachers routinely send us thank you notes from their students describing how thrilled and grateful they are to have been to the Observatory and what they learned. This kind of evaluation is ongoing, including daily conversations with visitors, and scanning of social media."

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. Provide a safe, nurturing, inviting, and much needed space as a platform for expression, and the community will use it.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Writ Large Press has a long history of creating engaging and successful events within the Los Angeles community, in collaboration with numerous producers, musicians and literary talent. In committing to this project they’ve outlined a timeline for having manuscripts ready for print, and vendors in place for the production of the book launch events.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Our project cultivates local businesses, public service facilities and non-traditional spaces into a Neighborhood Literary-scape.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The project will facilitate a series of 7 three-part programs.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our project seeks to highlight and legitimize local literary voices as a means for sparking public discourse and energizing the authentic spaces of the city. The neighborhood becomes, in effect, a literary event space, a literary-scape. The goal therefore is to not only continue drawing new visitors to the underserved neighborhoods of Los Angeles, but to draw their attention to overlooked or unusual spaces and to explore the idea that art can be everywhere and benefit everyone. In lieu of economic development being tied solely to new outsider business, this project cultivates and highlights the rich resources, everyday sites, and traditions of the existing community, enabling residents, local artists, and established businesses to benefit from the area’s increasing economic vitality, rather than being replaced.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The local businesses that we plan on collaborating with are either owned by women, people of color, or small businesses that are at risk of displacement due to gentrification, or have been threatened by some form of economic hardship.",

In 2050?": "First, The Neighborhood Literary-scape Project prompts residents and visitors to think about literary talent and inspiration as lying deep but unseen within a city neighborhood, rather than merely imported to performance venues or bookstores. We would especially like to unearth and highlight the expressive traditions of local communities of color, whose members engage in spoken word and other oral genres.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Workshops, attendance, and book launches will be documented by an ethnographer trained in qualitative methods of video recording, interviewing, and narrative description. Utilizing the same method for calculating attendance that Poesia Para La Gente has used at its regular events, Poesia Para La Gente bookmarks will be distributed to every attendee at all events. Interviews will be conducted to gather their impressions and suggestions for improvement, and will be displayed in a project blog linked to Avenue 50 Studio’s website. Books will be sold at events, bookstores and local businesses and bookkeeping practices can be used to keep track of revenues.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One challenge would be to convince the local businesses that there is indeed value in building relationships with a social service organization, publisher and local poets. This would only apply to those businesses we haven’t yet made a commitment with, as several businesses have committed to this project, or have expressed interest. One way to tackle this challenge would be to implement effective means of evaluating the outcome of the first completed program (of the 7). By calculating attendance and books sales, and evaluating the marketing and promotional analytics, we would be able to compile a presentation for their benefit.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Neighborhood Literary-scape Project is a collaborative urban place-making and economic development project. Avenue 50 Studio and Writ Large Press will utilize our wide-ranging partnerships and over 14 years of experience in literary arts in L.A. to institute the Neighborhood Literary-scape Project. This project seeks to unearth our local literary arts as a key urban resource for place-making, public discourse, education and economic revitalization in the most culturally diverse, yet economically struggling, neighborhoods throughout LA. It will do so by turning local businesses, public service facilities, and public spaces not typically thought of as arts locales into places for the cultivation, publication, and performance of poetry.",

Access to open space and park facilities, 2. Number/quality of informal spaces for play, 3. Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park, 4. Intergenerational play opportunities, 5. Per capita crime rates, and 6. Perceived neighborhood safety.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "To evaluate the effectiveness of Unlock the Block events in improving 2050 play metrics, we will implement participant surveys in conjunction with the residents and community stakeholders who help to organize each event. Those who attend the event will be asked about their basic demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, gender); and these characteristics will be compared to census tract data to determine how representative the participants are of the neighborhood population. These findings, along with per capita attendance numbers, will speak to the effectiveness of these events in providing access to play space (Metric 1).",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Through our work in South LA, the Eastern Coachella Valley, and the informal settlements of Kenya, we have learned key lessons about developing underutilized public spaces through a community-driven process.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "There are 4 challenges to successfully implementing Unlock the Block:",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Our idea is to bring play - designed and managed by residents - to the streets of LA through an initiative called Unlock the Block.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Our idea is to bring play to the streets of LA through an initiative called Unlock the Block (UtB). We must find ways to make opportunities for safe and dynamic, public play available and easily accessible to all age groups, in every corner of the county. Of course, that is easier said than done – parks are expensive, and take considerable time to develop, design, and build. But, they are just one place where play thrives – play can be ignited almost anywhere, including on the one thing that Los Angeles has an abundance of – our streets. Unlock the Block would make it easy for any neighborhood to temporarily transform a suitable street into a vibrant and safe space for residents age 0-100 to play, in the ways that best fit their needs.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "‘Children must play, and children, if they live in the cities, must play in the streets.’ -1914 New York Times. For generations, residential streets served as informal play spaces for children. In recent decades, streets have become increasingly dominated by automobiles with little accommodation for other needs, even though many neighborhoods continue to lack safe, accessible spaces to play. More recently, research has revealed the key role of play in physical health and intellectual and social development. Cities like San Francisco and New York have responded to these issues by launching “play streets” programs: temporary, car-free street spaces where residents can play.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "The beauty of Unlock the Block is its simplicity and agility. Within months of starting, we can bring safe and dynamic play to the people and places in LA with the highest need and demand. Within years, we can transform our streets—and the perception of our streets—into safe and sustainable spaces for community play. By 2050, it is feasible that everyone who wants to play can play regularly, regardless of the availability of traditional park resources in their neighborhood.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Unlock the Block (UTB) will benefit all communities in LA. But we will begin by addressing the needs of LA’s underserved neighborhoods. We will prioritize parts of the city where there is a shortage of open space, or parks, and areas that fall outside the boundaries of other community investment programs (like Promise Neighborhoods, Building Healthy Communities, or gang intervention programs), so that communities who have been left out of the discussion on where and how play takes place, will have the opportunity to contribute their ideas and make play happen in their streets, on their terms, with or without the presence of a park. We anticipate that, in the pilot phase Unlock the Block events will target neighborhoods in each of LA’s main geographic regions. In success, the city program is easily adopted or scaled to cover all of LA County.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Unlock the Block brings together a number of Los Angeles-based organizations currently working to improve play, health, environment, and economy for our under-resourced communities. Kounkuey Design Initiative’s (KDI) confirmed partners for this project include Community Health Councils (CHC) and Jubilee Consortium.

Currently, neighborhood mapping that investigates land use and narrative documentation of street views is underway. Logistically, Our Skid Row operates a temporary storefront that currently headquarters all its programs including, Open Studios. Collaborative design workshops with many local organizations including LA CAN, Downtown Women's Center, Lamp Arts Community, and others are planned for August and September. The start-up logistics of Our Skid Row have already been funded and foundational programs are already in progress.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Our Skid Row Community Design Studio (Our Skid Row) will be a new hub where Skid Row residents, downtown stakeholders, and active Angelenos design a better place to call home. Our Skid Row is built on the foundation that everybody holds expertise around their experience living in the built environment, everybody should participate in shaping their neighborhood, and everybody needs to live in an equitable community. Through community-engaged research, participatory design workshops and design-enrichment programs, built installations and public dialog, Our Skid Row community will design catalytic projects that will appropriately improve the neighborhood in the short term, while pushing for an equitable vision for long-term sustainability.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. Solutions that are not generated and supported by the community will fail. No matter how good the intentions are, without community buy-in and a shared sense of ownership, solutions that do not engage the people will not adequately address the specific nature of the problem.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Meaningful participation and resident involvement is key to the success of the project, but sometimes difficult to cultivate. To support outreach efforts, a resident will be hired as an Outreach coordinator to focus on generating a strong resident base.",

    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Multiple publics will benefit from Our Skid Row, including Skid Row residents, downtown stakeholders, and Los Angeles County. The residents, both the housed and unhoused population, will have the opportunity to voice their visions and generate design solutions for their own neighborhood. This is an opportunity to increase a sense of ownership and civic involvement in their community. Additionally, community-driven improvements to the neighborhood will begin building bridges to the rapidly developing downtown area, creating shared resources and amenities, and opportunities for interaction between residents, business owners, and visitors, creating a more cohesive region. Lastly, Los Angeles County will benefit from focused efforts to equitably develop the lowest income and most under-resourced area of the region.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Our Skid Row will be a community resource that all neighborhood organizations and residents have access to. We will also leverage our design network to enhance design support resources and build upon existing collaborations and partnerships with organizations in the community. Three critical factors are outreach, accessibility, and continuity. To ensure welcomed participation of all residents and organizations in the area, street and organizational outreach will be implemented for all programming. Activities will be accessible and will not limit participation due to lack of technical abilities. Lastly, programming will be continuous to nurture cumulative growth, involvement and leadership development.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Our Skid Row will provide a creative outlet for Angelenos to explore collective definitions of sustainable and equitable place-making. The project functions on multiple scales and time frames. In the 2050 time table, Our Skid Row lays out a roadmap for a socially and physically sustainable community though a comprehensive neighborhood plan and implementation strategy. For today, Our Skid Row residents will identify specific underutilized spaces, and design catalytic projects that will begin steps towards the long-term vision.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our Skid Row will create 3 new employment opportunities in the community design field, with at least one position for local residents. This will be the first design focused institution in Skid Row, adding to existing arts programs and collectives- many of which have been operating for many years. Rather than focus on just creating individual designers, the goal of Our Skid Row is to collect design intentions, create collective design solutions, and have design reflect the culture of the community in the built environment. The process is inclusive and built on active participation and civic engagement. With the ability to design and build small projects, these can accumulate leverage larger more substantial improvements such as public works improvements, attracting capital investments and seeding additional start-ups. Skid Row can be re-perceived as a leader in the design community!",

    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "My City is a web & mobile app that provides curated & personalized tours for travelers by Los Angeles locals.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "To implement this idea, we will first develop the mobile app so that it is accessible, aesthetically pleasing & easy to use. As a User Experience / User Interface Designer & Developer, Ray has experience in designing & building small-scale to large-scale consumer & enterprise applications, which will help with the development of the technology.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Rates of volunteerism will rise since locals will be driven to clean up their communities and neighborhoods to attract tourists. Adults will get sufficient social and emotional support due to the social networking aspect of the app, allowing adults to connect with other adults and share their experiences with Los Angeles with outsiders and locals. Tourists will attend more cultural events since tour specialists will want to include these type of exciting activities in their itineraries. Users of the app will be compelled to explore the city and will use public transportation to fully immerse themselves in the experience. My City aims to expose tourists to parts of LA that are otherwise unknown to travelers, thus giving small neighborhoods the opportunity to gain more business by promoting their communities on the app. Users of the app would join neighborhood councils to create marketing campaigns to attract more tourists to their community. My City will give locals a chance to make money part or full time, without having to drive to or have an office. Thus users are able to work from home and not have to worry about transit. The social networking aspect of the app will also help generate more social media friends. Tourists will attend more public/open street gatherings as part of tours.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "It’s highly likely that we can build & deploy this app within a span of 6-7 months, while using the remaining 5-6 months fine tuning the details & making any adjustments based on market demand. Ray brings the business, technical, & design know-how, while Mitchel has experience in digital marketing & organizational growth, thus making sure that a quality product is made & is marketed properly.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Proposed collaboration (we want to work with partners!)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "MyCity would benefit Angelenos & anyone living in Los Angeles. Angelenos would make money as Tour Specialists by providing phenomenal & personalized experiences to Travelers. Additionally, locals can also pair up with other locals who have new ideas to share, since there's always something new that Angelenos can learn from each other about this city.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Traveling abroad & not having the ability to speak the language or explore foreign cities with a local to get a more authentic experience.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Challenges that we participate:",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "MyCity is a web & mobile app that bridges Travelers with local Tour Specialists. Mass commercialized tours are prevalent as a one-size fits all solution. MyCity democratizes commercialized tours by providing Travelers curated & personalized tours based on the Traveler's interests. Tour Specialists will provide curated tours that would be exciting & engaging for the Travelers. Tour Specialists can also offer transportation & lodging by linking existing accounts with AirBnb, Uber, or similar apps. We would incorporate social networking as a tool to bridge Travelers & Tour Specialists based on mutual interests & friends. Users can create profiles on themselves & what makes LA special - from lists of their favorite restaurants to beaches.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "MyCity can help make LA the best place to connect today by bridging Tourists with Angelenos in more deep & diverse experiences around the city. Locals will have the ability to share their favorite places in LA & give travelers a more immersive experience with the city. This type of interaction between tourists & locals would provide breadth that brings more awareness about the local areas in Los Angeles that mass commercialized tour packages & buses do not do. Thus, promoting small LA businesses to eager travelers & connecting tourists with the city’s diverse cultures & communities.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will measure success in terms of active users (travelers & tour specialists), month-to-month growth, quarterly growth, year-to-date (YTD), customer satisfaction, & quality of product.",

    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Lesson 1: Who are the neighborhood market owners? Many neighborhood markets in Los Angeles are family-owned and operated by immigrant or first generation entrepreneurs. Though passionate and driven, many do not have the time or resources to advance their education in ways that benefit their business and community. At times, limited language skills can be a barrier as well. The Healthy Neighborhood Market Network was designed to meet the specific needs of small food businesses operating in historically disenfranchised communities. Our seminars are offered in Spanish, Korean and English, and at times of the week that are best for small store owners. We also do extensive “boots on the ground” outreach and in-store consulting so that store owners can receive valuable information and resources directly in their place of business.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Los Angeles Food Policy Council builds the capacity of small \"mom n’ pop\" store owners in ‘food desert’ communities to thrive as good food businesses and civic leaders! Through our Healthy Neighborhood Market Network, we connect LA’s multi-ethnic, multi-lingual neighborhood market owners to food industry experts, government reps and community advocates who share skills, resources and mentorship. Our cross-discipline trainings combine business development, civic leadership and health and nutrition fields.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Our goal is to train 100 neighborhood markets and entrepreneurs across Los Angeles County within 12 months as good food business leaders. By reaching this number of businesses, we aim to support new leadership in the movement to ensure all communities have access to Good Food!",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Since 2012, the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network has touched at over 400 neighborhood markets in low-income communities through outreach efforts, and trained approximately 160 stores at five capacity-building seminars. Our multi-lingual staff has successfully organized language-specific and accessible resources for participants through two Korean language, one Spanish language and two multi-lingual events. Through direct consulting, we led and collaborated on five corner store conversion projects in high-need areas in the last year, which gave us a lot of grounded perspective on what it takes to work with neighborhood markets. Over the last 2 years, we’ve refined the approach, developed a comprehensive Resource Guide, and now we’re ready to combine the “best of” of material into one comprehensive curriculum. The three business and leadership development trainings are do-able because we’ve done them for the past 2 years, and the new curriculum is just a couple months away from completion.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The heart of the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network is collaboration! The whole idea to bring business and leadership education to neighborhood food businesses came from partners in the LA Food Policy Council Working Group on Healthy Food Retail & Food Equity, which includes friends from non-profits like Community Health Councils, PolicyLink, Community Coalition, Business Resource Group, and API Obesity Prevention Alliance. We have also benefited immensely by collaborating with industry pros who have dedicated their time and skills to support mom n’ pop stores. Here are some of the individuals who have shared their talents for this project as trainers and content experts: Michael Powell (brand strategist, Shook Kelley), David Kaufman (Manager, Unified Grocers), Bryan Libit (architect), Barnaby Montgomery (CEO, Yummy.com Markets), Sharon Evans (CEO, Business Resource Group), Daniel Tellalian (Principal, Emerging Markets inc/CA FreshWorks Fund), Jill Overdorf (Executive Chef, Cooseman Shipping International), Rudy Espinoza (Executive Director, Leadership for urban Renewal Network (LURN)), Jeff Biddle and Ashley Gibbons (Whole Foods Market), Michelle O’Grady (Team Friday), Sirena Pellarollo (Viva la Vida Holistic Health), Helena Jubany and Robert Chavez (Founder and General Manager, Fresco Community Market.) We also always partner with a variety of community development finance organizations and local government agencies who provide direct services for small stores, including Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment (PACE), Vermont Slauson Community Development Corporation, Valley Economic Development Corporation, Kiva Zip and the wonderful staff at the LA County Department of Public Health. We have worked with all of these awesome individuals and organizations over the past 3 years, and they will continue to be valued and essential partners in the success of the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Within the next year of activity, we will track and measure our progress toward several indicators of success:",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "•\tLow-income food entrepreneurs. Healthy Neighborhood Market Network participants leave our trainings with a business plan to integrate new healthy food products successfully. With new Network connections and LAFPC staff by their side, storeowners will have support to implement their dreams. We expect many store owners to see an increase in customers, sales and community support. These neighborhood markets gain access to Good Food resources from marketing and merchandising to leadership skills building and community outreach. Many will pursue new partnerships and capital investments that will benefit their businesses.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our surveys and collaborations with neighborhood market owners reveal high levels of social and economic isolation. Often, market owners are shocked to learn that there are educational and networking spaces specifically for them. Participation at a Healthy Neighborhood Market Network event is sometimes their first time attending a conference or seminar.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1.\t“Will people buy the healthy food at the stores?” We know there is unmet demand in LA’s ‘food desert’ areas because of grocery retail leakage data. However, how can we ensure that demand will be re-oriented to new healthy food options at neighborhood markets? We can’t. That’s why partnerships with neighborhood institutions and community-based organizations is key to success. We facilitate those partnerships, and also provide tools and resources for CBOs on “best practices” for working with neighborhood markets. We emphasize the “Good Food Neighbor Pledge” for local schools, churches, block clubs and neighborhood councils to pledge to buy healthy food as an institution from their new healthy neighborhood market. And we empower store owners to leverage their community partnerships for marketing and to offer in-store healthy food demos.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Growing Good Food businesses where they’re needed most! Did you know that almost 90% of grocery retail stores in South LA and Boyle Heights are small neighborhood markets? Did you also know that millions of dollars leave these neighborhoods every year in grocery sales made elsewhere? Imagine if ALL neighborhood markets offered wholesome grocery foods? Our strategy is to invest in existing businesses to help them expand healthy food options and keep money in the neighborhood! Within 1 year, at least half of our storeowner participants (50 stores!) will carry fruits and vegetables. That translates to about 100,000 residents with new and improved access to healthy food right in their neighborhoods."

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "#1 - Outreach: Shane's Inspiration anticipates outreach and engagement as a challenging opportunity for the community event aspect of this initiative. Los Angeles is a vast landscape comprised of thousands of communities. Drawing participation from cross sectors is often not easy. To overcome this challenge, we will once again rely heavily on our existing outreach mechanisms, partners, and advocates to help promote interest in the community events. We will also begin promoting the calendar of events far in advance in an effort to secure the dates in the community members' schedules. We will send out \"Save The Date\" alerts in substantial time prior to the events, as well as reminders a few days in advance. We will also get the events listed on several high traffic community calendar sites to help promote to a wider audience. We will engage the high profile supporters of Shane’s Inspiration in social media outreach to their followers, creating an endorsement of sorts which will help to increase interest and attendance. We will have an RSVP opportunity so that we can gauge interest, informing the need to increase outreach in advance if necessary.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Play as a Uniting Force: The school based aspect of the Together We Play L.A.! initiative will directly impact over 3,000 children in over 50 schools. Our children of today will be our leaders of tomorrow in 2050. We need future leaders that can see beyond our differences, and who are able to unite their communities by building common ground. To that end, Shane’s Inspiration will unite approximately 1000 children with disabilities with 2,000 typically developing children for a day of play on an inclusive playground over a series of 40 field trips. These children will have an opportunity to dissolve their misconceptions, find their similarities, and discover respect, friendship and understanding. This experiential play opportunity will be combined with pre and post educational presentations that explore the barriers that divide us based on common misconceptions. The uniting principals learned through this process can then be applied across race, ability and cultural divides. This aspect of the initiative will run concurrent with the school year, September through June.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementing the Together We Play L.A.! initiative in the next 12 months is achievable because Shane’s Inspiration will develop this project on the strong foundation of partnerships and programs that have been created over the last 16 years. By combining the resources generously provided by LA 2050 with these three key component partnerships: Parks; Schools; and Community; we feel confident that the initiative would be a great success.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Together We Play L.A.! will unite the Los Angeles community through 50 play-based events in schools and parks, creating common ground.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Together We Play L.A.! initiative will directly impact 3,000 children, approximately 1,000 of these children will have some form of disability. Most of the children we reach are between the ages of 1 and 13 and come from a variety of socio-economic circumstances. Within our school-based programs, over 80% of the schools we serve are classified as Title I, which is an indicator of poverty among the student population. Each student that participates in the school program will take home a family guide on inclusion, providing the potential to reach an additional 5,000+ family members. This guide will be printed in English and Spanish.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Shane's Inspiration owes the success of our programs in great part to the collaborative partners that we have been fortunate enough to have had through the years. Shane's Inspiration has always approached partnership with a win/win strategy which has yielded strong, loyal and long lasting relationships. We will work collaboratively with many partners on this initiative but will rely heavily on two key partnerships, one of which is the City of Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department. From the first project which opened in 2000, to the 30th and beyond, this partnership is at the foundation of the organization's success. This department will work very closely with Shane's Inspiration to support the success of our goals as all 50 events will take place at parks throughout the City of Los Angeles. The parks are managed and maintained by City staff so the contribution of this department will be substantial.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Access to open space and park facilities: Together We Play L.A.! will utilize Shane's Inspiration's inclusive playgrounds throughout Los Angeles for all 50 events. There are currently 37 inclusive playgrounds to choose from which will serve a diverse L.A. community.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "DANGEROUS MISCONCEPTIONS DIVIDE US: When Shane's Inspiration opened the first playground in 2000, we were certain of the impact it would have on children with disabilities, most of whom would be playing in a playground for the very first time since traditionally designed playgrounds left them sitting on the sidelines. But what we didn't anticipate was the profound opportunity it would present to impact the perceptions of typically developing children and adults who may have never had the opportunity to know someone with a disability. We were told that children with disabilities were violent, contagious and didn't need to or weren't able to play. We realized the opportunity to bridge this divide and eliminate these harmful misconceptions was great and the programming aspect of our mission was born. The Together We Play L.A.! initiative will help us take this mission to a broader audience and include utilizing play as a bridge to dissolve barriers between races, cultures and generations."

According to the Mayo Clinic, unhealthy lifestyles marked by poor food choices and inactivity are the leading cause of obesity in children. Latino youths suffer disproportionately from obesity, and LA alone contains 4.9 million Hispanics (9% of the nation’s entire Hispanic population)."

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The Industry is partnering with the 5D Global Design Studio (5D) and the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc) to help build the multimedia and logistical infrastructure to make this project a reality.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Over 100 artists, production and support staff will be involved in the development and execution of HOPSCOTCH, increasing employment in the creative industries. But even more importantly, the corporate partnerships that The Industry will engage in to develop the piece will further open the doors between the creative and commercial industries. This will lead to more corporations investing in employment in the creative industries.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "HOPSCOTCH will be experienced in three ways: first, from a limited audience inside the limousines with the artists as they drive around Los Angeles. The intimacy and surprise of being driven to an unexpected destination offers these audiences a unique operatic adventure.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "HOPSCOTCH is an audacious operatic adventure that takes the audience on crisscrossing car journeys throughout LA.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "HOPSCOTCH is an audacious operatic adventure told through 18 car journeys. Audiences are taken on a ride to an unknown destination, with performers both inside the car and on the streets. LA-based composers and writers are creating a story to be experienced “on the move.” A larger audience experiences the work for free in a central hub, where the 18 journeys are live-streamed. Developed in collaboration with SCI-Arc, the hub will become a temporary cultural center, with concerts and dialogues throughout October 2015. The Industry’s last opera, INVISIBLE CITIES, was called “the opera of the future” by Wired Magazine and a finalist for the 2014 Pulitzer Prize. HOPSCOTCH takes the immersive “moving audience” experience to a new level.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "HOPSCOTCH takes the entire city of Los Angeles as its backdrop, and we are creating a work that we believe will inspire the broadest possible spectrum of audiences: young audiences and new operagoers; art patrons and opera-lovers; technology enthusiasts; fans of multidisciplinary art, architecture, site-specific and community-based work; cultural tourists and members of the local community. We look to the eclectic and diverse audience that made INVISIBLE CITIES at Union Station a sold-out phenomenon. The scale of the project inspired people who even simply walked through the station during the opera; we believe HOPSCOTCH has even greater potential to reach as wide an audience of Angelenos as can be. Thanks to the central hub, HOPSCOTCH allows access to a large audience to experience the performance at no cost.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "INVISIBLE CITIES was developed and executed within 12 months, and became a phenomenon, with 22 sold-out performances, three extensions, and international acclaim. Wired Magazine called it “the opera of the future,” and The Los Angeles Times’ critic Mark Swed described it as “an inventive production that could, and should, be done anywhere.” We are confident that we can successfully produce HOPSCOTCH by October 2015.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The first lesson involves how we define our audience. For us, “new audiences” include a wide array of the LA community. They include culturally-conscious patrons who love traditional opera, but are looking for something new that can ignite their imagination of what opera can be. They also include young audiences and those new to opera, but hungry for immersive and unique artistic events.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The first challenge is financial. Although INVISIBLE CITIES was a success in every way, including financially, we are beginning the fundraising process all over again to support this more ambitious new project. The Industry remains a very small 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, with box office revenue only covering a small percentage of the project's costs. In order to successfully implement this project, we will need to secure in-kind support from institutional partners. With 5D and SCI-Arc as partners, the process of securing collaborators in the realization of the work is successfully underway. Conversations are also already underway with technology sponsors that will help make this project both financially feasible and state-of-the-art.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "HOPSCOTCH is planned for October 2015, but the concept for the project has been in development since April of 2013. We are currently at the stage of securing partners to realize this work. The Industry is thrilled to work with the Southern California Institute for Architecture on the design of the central hub. SCI-Arc will host the hub as well, meaning the radius of the project in the city encompasses downtown, Chinatown, Boyle Heights, and other sites that offer a wide range of vistas and cityscapes. Alex McDowell’s 5D World-Building Studio is also collaborating on the media elements of the project: video and media inside the cars and projections both onto the street and inside the cars.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "The cultural scene we imagine in LA 2050 is a highly collaborative one, where the traditional boundaries that separate visual art, music, theater, film, and dance are broken down, and the conversation between the arts is fluid. The spirit of innovation, curiosity, and adventure that has always defined LA makes it the perfect candidate for the world’s next great center of creativity. We believe opera is an ideal catalyst for that transformation, as an inherently collaborative and multimedia art form. By creating ambitious large-scale collaborations with LA-based artists, The Industry’s projects have already worked to realize that vision in this city today, engaging and inspiring new audiences for the arts in general. HOPSCOTCH, will be our most ambitious celebration of the cooperative spirit of LA’s art-making future. It’s a project that is both “very LA” and an aspiration for what LA can still become."

    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have four business partners and four school partners and the program has already been tracked. This includes classroom visits and visits to companies' major headquarters. Meetings between partners are currently taking place at this time, for the purpose of creating scheduling and curriculum development. We are also in the process of forming further collaborations with community-based organizations who serve as clients for the students' campaigns.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One barrier is to be able to accomplish this with a small staff, led by a Program Coordinator and Lead Instructor Mentors. Our strategy for meeting that challenge is to work with volunteers who also serve as professional mentors. Another barrier is to have enough reserve funding to be able to have the flexibility to bring in tools and resources where needed. To address this, we hired a grant writer to insure the sustainability of the program. Further, we are creating a strategic plan for developing the program over the next 3 years, building an advisory panel to broaden student participation and business collaboration.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "California's leading educators are proponents of building smaller learning communities, such as \"pathways\" and \"academies\" which focus on broad industry themes, such as business and entrepreneurship, arts, entertainment and media, engineering and health services, et al.. In fact, this movement toward schools within schools is gaining quick momentum. Consequently, the Los Angeles Unified School District is showing marked interest in this model and work-based learning practices, in general. L.A. Futures is the connective tissue between the creative industry and schools and, as such, creates the dynamic partnerships that take it from theory to application. Jobs are the priority concern of our high school students. At the same time, creative companies in Los Angeles boast some of the most exciting career opportunities in which they're interested. Through direct exposure, the L.A. Futures program connects the dots for our students from where they are-to higher education-to the jobs they aspire toward. This makes learning exciting, real and tangible for them. L.A. Futures will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn in 2050 because our creative workforce will come for our own community--because the creative industry will be richer because of the multiple voices that are represented in its products and services--because industry will be able to meet diversity of employment goals--and because our workforce will be prepared and energized to shift culture through job roles and practices we don't even know the names of!",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Formal evaluation measurements are used to assess the performance and quality-level of the L.A. Futures program and to make recommendations for improvement. This includes entry, mid-point and exit surveys; Dialogue with educators and business partners to assess and improve curriculum delivery, strengthen overall program experience, and cultivate further career pathway opportunities; Further data is gathered of senior class before and after graduation to calculate college and vocational training and admission rates; In the coming year, we intend to form an advisory council of educators and industry professionals to help us bring the L.A. Futures program to the next level.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "L.A. Futures is a work-based learning program which partners public schools with major creative companies to prepare students for success in college and beyond. Students build competencies and life skills through professional mentorships, job role exposure and student-driven public service projects. Through these real-world experiences, students can build success tracks into our community's thriving creative industry. An industry which represents over 10% of the gross economic contribution to the Los Angeles region needs a job-prepared talent pool to draw upon. High school is where to start. Educational entrepreneurship, through business and community partnerships, provides the resources. L.A. Futures is the connection.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "L.A. Futures emboldens classroom learning by learning and life skill experiences with industry professionals in the classroom and at their places of work. Theory and principles are translated into real-world practices and our students connect acquired knowledge with the needs and expectation of the workplace. As such, our students make the connection between college and career and become workforce ready. By developing the talent and capacity of our younger generations, we are investing in the future viability of our local economy.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Our confirmed business partner t confirmed collaborators are:",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Percentage of community college students completing a certificate, degree, or transfer-related program in six years",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "L.A. Futures builds success tracks for public high school youth into college and career",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Since it was inaugurated several years ago, L.A. Futures has served hundreds of upper-division high school students who have gone on to higher education at twice the rate of their peers. Through partnering with creative organizations like TBWA\\CHIAT\\DAY, DDB, Ruben Postaer & Associates (RPA), The Phelps Group, GreyWorldWide, Muse Advertising, Saatchi & Saatchi and IgnitedUSA, the program has provided real world applications to college and career-bound initiatives within secondary public schools. Curriculum development and learning materials have been aligned with Common Core Standards with an emphasis on 21st century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration and critical thinking. Students enrolled in L.A. Futures participate in the program throughout their upper-division experience. Throughout their experience, students routinely attend sessions at the headquarters of the creative companies that serve as school partners. During these sessions, students engage in a comprehensive curriculum that imparts principles, techniques and tools for self-development in exciting new career roles. Mentored by industry professionals, students get an inside look at key projects from strategy through creative execution. They learn how business is managed and see how today’s creative professionals with across disciplines. Working in teams, students are also challenged to put their learning into practice by engaging with local nonprofits which become their clients. . For example, Dorsey High School senior class participants revamped promotional pieces for education, parenting and job training at Community Build, an inner city resource for underserved youth. In the end, students leave the program with increased social capital, practical tools, higher expectations and a clearer understand of the demands of today’s employer. We believe that L.A. Futures is a powerful link in the continuum of college-bound-to-career efforts at a critical time in their decision-making process.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Participants of L.A. Futures mirror the ethnic and economic strata of local public school student populations. Current data describes our Academy student population as follows: 72.3% Latino, 9.6% Black, 10.1% White, 4% Asian, 2.1% Filipino and Pacific Islander, .04% Native Amer. & 1.9% mixed races. 67% of our students are classified as low-income and are eligible for the federally assisted free lunch program. By drawing from the current and future talent pool of our own community the creative industry is greatly benefitted if we bear in mind that 726,300 direct and indirect jobs, or 1 in 7 jobs, represent the human capital that vitalizes this industry.",

    "goal": "LIVE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Through a network of carefully selected CBOs, we will aim to benefit low-income families with children who live in LA’s most challenged neighborhoods. Neighborhoods of focus include East LA (Boyle Heights), San Fernando Valley (North Hollywood, Pacoima, Panorama City, Sunland), San Gabriel Valley (Alhamabra, El Monte, Glendale, and Pasadena), South Central (Jefferson Park, Watts), and parts of Central LA (Downtown and Hollywood) and South Bay (Inglewood, Torrance). We serve a large population of single and first-time mothers, predominantly from Latino and African American communities. We also serve refugee children from Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan through a partnership with the Tiyya Foundation. Here is a snapshot of the children, parents and families we serve:",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Metric #1 - The number of children and families served: With each pick-up or distribution of goods, we will survey partner CBOs to measure the number of children and families that are served by that particular donation. Because a majority of items donated are requested based on real-time need, partner sites will have a strong understanding of this number. At the end of the calendar year, we do an annual survey to obtain annual summary data on the children and families served for each partner site.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Lesson #1 - Handouts only serve as band-aids: While emergency services are necessary and a component of the Baby Buggy model, research shows that giving a good or service away without anything in exchange—in this case, their participation—lessens the value of that good or service and can even fuel the poverty cycle. On the other hand, while a good or service may initially be the reason an individual gets in the door, CBOs report that these parents are more likely to continue due to a feeling of empowerment or accomplishment. The goal of our program is to directly impact the growing rate of children living in poverty in LA by instilling self-worth and supporting self-sufficiency.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Barrier #1 - Access to affordable storage that meets our needs: As an organization driven by distribution of tangible goods, we require a physical space that can accommodate small and large incoming donations, as well as monthly inventory. This space also has to be centralized with drive-up access to limit the workload for representatives from CBOs that are picking up donated items. Unfortunately, storage that is accessible and meets our needs in a city as widespread as LA is difficult to come by and often expensive, thereby presenting a potential barrier for our program. For the interim, we have secured warehouse space in Valencia, Calif. at a 50% discounted rate for larger deliveries and have access to moving trucks when CBOs have difficulty arranging transportation for scheduled pick-ups. We have also secured two (2) 10 X 30 units in Glendale, Calif. for smaller deliveries and shipments that also offer drive-up access. However, we plan to reconcile this by partnering with an existing CBO to rent shared warehouse space that can accommodate small and large deliveries in or just north of downtown LA. This will help us to lower costs and work efficiently with our partner CBOs. We have already researched potential partners to make this transition by the end of 2014.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Today, nearly one quarter of children living in Los Angeles live in poverty. This rate is higher than the child poverty rate for California and the U.S. as a whole. A lack of access to basic needs presents significant health and safety concerns for children, but poverty can also have lasting adverse effects on a child’s mental and social development. Our goal is to give low-income families in LA access to free critical items that will improve a child’s health, well-being and safety as incentives to participate in programs that will simultaneously help to lift them out of poverty. In doing so, we provide for the immediate needs of a child while giving families the necessary long-term support to improve their financial situation.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "We believe our initiative will help to make LA the healthiest place to live by 1) improving the health and safety of children living in poverty in LA, 2) lowering the prevalence of children impacted by adverse childhood experiences, and 3) lowering the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard by offering resources that help to halt the cycle of poverty.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our initiative helps to lower the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard, today and in the future, by giving families resources to break the poverty cycle. It costs almost two hours of minimum wage in LA to afford a pack of diapers. When we provide critical needs like diapers, we help families put their income toward groceries, electric bills, and other necessary household expenditures. We also give parents the security to better provide for their families. In the long-term, we offer them the tools and skills training to succeed through engagement in anti-poverty programs.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have a unique advantage in that implementing our program will not require a great deal of research or testing to successfully start achieving our goal. Our scalable model has been tried and tested over the course of 13 years by our NY operation, with more than 7.3 million items donated since the organization’s inception. This has afforded us the ability to test strategies, learn from mistakes, and build on successes to adapt accordingly. By working with an existing framework, we also have systems and policies and procedures in place that can take an organization six months to a year to build. Nonetheless, scaling an existing program in a new market or region also comes with new challenges. To overcome some of these barriers, Baby Buggy merged with LA Diaper Drive, an organization created to meet the growing number of parents in LA who are struggling to provide diapers for their babies. LA Diaper Drive shared a similar mission as Baby Buggy, using diapers as an incentive for parent participation in proven anti-poverty programs. By joining forces, we now have access to more resources, space, and support on the ground to start achieving our goals within 12 months.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Baby Buggy provides families in need with essential children's gear and products as incentive to participate in anti-poverty programs.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We will implement this project through a four-pronged approach, 1) scale up a network of community-based organizations (CBOs) that directly serve target populations, 2) cultivate partnerships with aligned corporations to secure critical gear for families in need, 3) work with communities to “recycle” gently used items, and 3) tailor donations to specific needs.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "It is inherent to our mission to collaborate with other non-profit organizations in LA to achieve our goals. While our goal is to expand our network, we currently collaborate with organizations such as Children’s Institute International (CII), Tiyya Foundation, Nurse-Family Partnership, and Black Infant Health to operate life-improving programs that meet our goals of helping low-income families become more self-sufficient. Through our partnership, we offer incentives to increase participation in these programs and classes. We also recently merged with LA Diaper Drive, an organization founded in LA in 2005, to expand our resources and deepen our impact in the LA community."

We began in Lincoln Heights, one of the most underserved communities in all of LA County, and a partnership was quickly established with the local high school, Abraham Lincoln High School (LHS). In 2010, “Mission 3.0” was created to specifically challenge LHS student-athletes, who are historically some of the lowest academic achievers at LHS. Through collaboration with the coaches, ITC provided mandatory tutoring sessions for the student-athletes, pushing them to strive beyond the minimum 2.0 GPA required to play. The success of our “Mission 3.0” program relied on that collaboration. In this sense, much of the foundation for the success of our program has already been implemented at the institutional level. Our biggest push will be to establish a foundation for sustained achievement with our students and their families.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Percentage of community college students completing a certificate, degree, or transfer-related program in six years",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our project is not designed to simply get students through high school, but to transform attitudes and perceptions about education that often paralyze students on their path to college.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "ITC will pull progress reports and grades of these student-athletes (mentees) every 5 weeks. This will ensure prompt intervention, where needed. We will evaluate each student’s citizenship, GPA, and when applicable, track graduation and college entry rates.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "What ITC has found is that once a student-athlete’s respective sports season has ended, his/her grades will plummet. The motivating factor that remains is the extracurricular activity itself. Our original Mission 3.0 program structure is not enough to influence changes in a youth’s deeply-seated habits, attitudes, behavior, and beliefs, particularly in light of the neighborhood in which they come.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "The path to college for many of our students is akin to a long, dark hallway. For many of them, the thought of walking down it has not crossed their minds at all. For many others, a plethora of fears grips them each time they venture to the entrance of that hallway. It feels out of reach. It is too dark; too easy to get lost, and too easy to never make it to the other side. These are fears that paralyze.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "ITC’s Mission 3.0 program has been in existence since the 2010-2011 academic year. In these last 4 years, not only have we solidified and increased the quality of our program, we have also seen the far-reaching effects the program has made on our students, families, and community. We are well-poised to add this mentoring component to our Mission 3.0 program because of its success over the last four years.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Having effective mentors and mentoring relationships are the foundation of any successful mentoring program. ITC is committed to completing its due diligence to best match mentors to mentees and provide the utmost quality of services. Our Program Managers will be providing ongoing, weekly supervision with all of our mentors. Additionally, we will host monthly group mentor trainings. However, effective mentoring is contingent upon many factors, some of which will be out of our control. Not all mentors will naturally be gifted and/or skilled with “effective” mentoring skills. Thus, we anticipate having to spend a lot of time troubleshooting and training; more specifically, the program will be impacted heavily if a mentor has to end their commitment prematurely. Additionally, recruiting and securing enough mentors for all of our student-athletes will certainly be an ongoing challenge. As it stands, finding enough quality, committed mentors has been our greatest challenge.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "In the City (ITC) seeks to launch a yearlong mentorship program with student-athletes at Lincoln High School. Like many schools on the Eastside, LHS students are critically underserved in terms of academic guidance. Moreover, in Lincoln Heights, where only 5.5% of adults over the age of 25 are college graduates, most parents are not equipped to help their children become college-ready. Our mentorship program is designed to build trusting partnerships with LHS student-athletes and their families, as they become advocates for their education and their community year-round. Mentors will help students keep track of their progress (A-G requirements, for example), while broadening their vision of a future for themselves and for their community.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The most immediate beneficiaries of our project will be the student-athletes of Lincoln High School (LHS). Only 38% of Lincoln students and 29% of LEMA students (the pilot Media/Arts school that shares its campus and sports program with LHS) are on track to complete their A-G requirements with a C or better. For a student body made up of over 1300 students, there is only one college counselor. Over 95% of our students are categorized as economically disadvantaged and participate in the federal school meal program, and the majority of our students’ parents have not received a college education (only 5.5% of adults in Lincoln Heights have earned a college degree). All of these conditions contribute to a learning environment in which college-readiness is the exception rather than the rule.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "ITC currently collaborates with Abraham Lincoln High School. We work closely with administrators, coaches, teachers, and the parents of the community every day to ensure program effectiveness. Dialogue regarding implementing Mission 3.0 at surrounding middle and high schools has begun, and it is only a matter of funding and time before ITC’s Mission 3.0 program infiltrates the LAUSD. EduCare provides our program with afterschool snacks necessary during our tutoring and mentoring sessions (http://educarefoundation.com/after-school-programs)."

This has been an acquired skill that we continue to grow in as staff and mentors to the students in our programs. As adults we can easily dismiss the youth in our community, but we have learned to listen and take their ideas and help put them into action.

In the last years we have seen this in the students we work with and the staff on our team. When given the opportunity, they have the drive and ability to surprise us with amazing ideas. Through genuine listening and authentic conversation we can tap into the fresh outlook and wisdom of youth in our currently estranged communities. The guidance and mentorship of invested, caring adults can help transform Los Angeles into a socially connected, civically active community.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "We anticipate two main challenges within this proposal. The first is the amount of individuals that we will be working with and the scheduling of time and the details that this will encompass. With so many stories to tell we will be working with our students schedules, our mentors work schedules and the individual’s schedules. We plan to allocate a portion of the funding to be able to hire and designate one point person for this project. In film terms this would be our Producer. Our strategy for making a smoother storytelling and editing process we plan on having one specific person do the communication with the young people telling their stories.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "We want to present the voices of our future leaders. By 2050, the youth of today will be the generation that inherits Los Angeles. One of them may even be the mayor in 2050. So why are we not listening to them?",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our project will benefit a variety of groups. First, the individual. The person who tells the story will be valued and listened to. Their story and ideas will be viewed by thousands. Through this message their own experiences will be honored and they will be empowered to continue their efforts in the community. These short videos will give young students a platform not only to find their voice, but to let that voice be heard across LA. By sharing their story, these students will become more confident in themselves, more empathetic towards their peers, and more committed to their community. These students will inspire others by the simple act of telling their story and sharing their solution ideas for an issue in their community.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "We will share the stories of 50 youth across LA to help turn their ideas in action!",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Outcome #1: The majority of students involved in the filming of their stories will have reported increased self-awareness and social awareness. These young people (ages 16-24) will have expressed greater ambition and motivation to succeed, specifically in their community in the City of Los Angeles."

Here we’d like to highlight two partnerships that are helping to ensure our success:",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1.\tThe LA2050 community has already established that connecting Angelenos is a huge challenge for a variety of reasons. We at Big Citizen HUB propose to connect youth from across Los Angeles in a meaningful way that not only expands the social capital of youth, but will have a long-term impact on the city and how people interact with those from different backgrounds and neighborhoods. We are confident that we have the programming, organizational culture, and tools in place to make that happen. However, we recognize that the logistics involved with bringing together young people from many neighborhoods may be a challenge for us. Our strategy for doing this successfully is the following: Our daily meeting space is located in Pico Union off the Metro Red Line. For participants who don’t have parents that can bring them each Saturday, we will have public transit pick-up spots in major areas (South LA, Watts, and Boyle Heights) in order for some of our youth to be chaperoned by a Youth Worker.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Big Citizen HUB will measure the experience of Big Citizens through pre-, mid- and post surveys and interviews to identify participant assets and growth areas and program efficacy. We’ll also use surveys to understand the experience of Youth Workers and community partners, and the perspectives of parents of Big Citizens.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1.\tIncreasingly, Americans, particularly young people, are losing faith in public institutions. This is evidenced in voter turnout, high school graduation and volunteer rates. A disengaged population quickly becomes a disenfranchised population. Specifically in Los Angeles, there are several related problems plaguing adolescents, including low overall academic achievement, gang violence, a lack of programs geared for middle school students, and racial and socioeconomic divides in the city. The large-scale challenges - social, environmental, economic - facing our globally connected world will require local, person-to-person participation and solutions. Adolescence is a key strategic time to engage youth in leadership, civic engagement and service initiatives - after which welfare dependency, limited productivity, and other social problems become life patterns for those who are not engaged. If we hope to move beyond the partisanship and gridlock that characterizes so much of American politics, we must start in the elementary, middle and high school years.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The mission of Big Citizen HUB is to build a community of Big Citizens, expanding the social capital of youth through curiosity, gratitude, team, and adventure. Big Citizen HUB, a project of Community Partners, will bring together young people, ages 8-24, outside of school, from all over Los Angeles to learn a common civic language, engage in dialogue, and build community to investigate local and global challenges ranging from poverty to environmental issues. We will convene on Saturdays between January and August. Big Citizens (ages 8-18) will form diverse teams, serve a minimum of 100 hours, and complete team-based projects while learning from Youth Workers (near-peer mentors and team leaders, ages 19-24), trained by Big Citizen HUB.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Today, Big Citizen HUB brings together youth from different neighborhoods, providing a common culture with which to relate, common experience with which to connect, opportunity for dialogue that explores differences in experience and perspective – all while learning important life skills and leadership skills that are necessary for success in school and the workforce. This type of opportunity currently does not exist in our city, where young people can come together from all over and meet new people through positive experiences.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "In 2015, Big Citizen HUB will engage 75 middle school students as Big Citizens, 14 near peer mentors as Youth Workers (19-24 year olds), and 30 community organizations. In this first year we anticipate about 80% of Big Citizens coming from low income families, with a racial breakdown as follows: 70% Latino, 15% Asian, 5% African American, 5% Caucasian, and 5% multiracial. We will utilize existing partnerships to recruit Big Citizens from the following areas: Boyle Heights, West LA, South LA, Watts, and Pico Union. We will work to create new partnerships in additional areas of L.A. to ensure diversity of our youth. Diversity is a key component of our program and a large factor in how beneficial the program will be.",

    "goal": "LEARN",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "It was in early 2013 that Two Bit Circus became impassioned to design an event that fused STEM principles with our own dynamic inventions, gadgets and amusements. In researching the state of education in regards to STEM and STEAM education, we were made aware of several distressing statistics: The National Math and Science Initiative has called it a ‘STEM crisis.’",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Youth unemployment and underemployment",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "SCOPE OF IMPACT: Into, Through, and Beyond the STEAM Carnival",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Assessing the impact of true STEAM education is not yet fully developed. There are Social Emotional Learning assessments that show promise, but we have been hard pressed to find off the shelf solutions to fit our needs for both pre-activity benchmarking and post activity progress. To that end, we will include developing these benchmarks as we continue to work on our innovative STEAM education program.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Our STEAM Carnival is a modern take on the traveling circus, bridging high-tech amusement with project-based learning. The Carnival is designed to inspire kids of all ages to engage in, and ultimately, pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, art, and math, hence ‘STEAM’! We ignite curiosity in young explorers through hands-on kit building, mentorship, workshops, and dynamic physical interaction with high-tech games. STEAM Carnival will draw 25,000 students, parents, and educators to our event held on October 22th-26th at the Port of Los Angeles.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "STEAM Carnival will bring together diverse facets of the community and offer a unique platform to address inequalities found in education and workforce development. To this end, Two Bit Circus will continue to partner with LAUSD schools to provide access to interactive learning tools during the Carnival as well as through its on-going related programs with Two Bit Circus and several nonprofit partners.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Community engagement and collaboration is a founding principal of STEAM Carnival.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Support from the Goldhirsh Foundation’s LA2050 will help ensure that the first STEAM Carnival will be a huge success in 2014. Additionally, funds will increase the organizational capacity to immediately begin to plan annual Carnivals in Los Angeles, serving different neighborhoods each year. This creates an incredible opportunity to serve the needs of each neighborhood, highlight the unique cultural, commercial and community-based offerings in each area of Los Angeles and give a boost to these local economies.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "With our partners, which include LAEP, LAUSD, local charter schools, and ultimately the UC extension system, the educational focus of STEAM Carnival will be centered more on the metrics of the “Student education pipeline,” as defined by LA 2050: “an integrated network of pre-schools, K-12 institutions, and higher education systems that prepares students for seamless transitions between high school, higher education institutions, and the workforce.”",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "One defining lesson comes from the iterative process of creating. Many games we’ve tackled have required multiple versions to perfect. Roadblocks are part of the iterative process, and an invaluable learning opportunity. As each project presents a unique set of constraints, our team must be flexible, often acquiring new skills. We seek to pass this lesson along to students that attend STEAM Carnival: learning is ‘lifelong’ and the often the most valuable progress results from persistence through challenge.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "STEAM Carnival is a modern take on the traveling circus featuring high-tech games, workshops and spectacles!",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "STEAM Carnival has been ‘full steam ahead’ since early 2013. Our team of engineers and inventors have been developing our products before we had the idea for STEAM Carnival, but an additional 20 games and workshops are being created for the event. We have internal benchmarks, which we have met thus far. In continuing into the next three months before the Carnival, our team works tirelessly to ensure that the event is poised and polished for our 25,000 attendees."

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "TODAY: This project helps make LA the best place to connect today because it gives people a space for real interaction between two communities that normally don't connect with one another. The outcome is that each partner sees something they never saw in themselves which consequently gets projected not only in their portraits but in their perspectives forever. As this project continues into the future, greater compassion between the people in our community will be present. This project acts as a portal to ourselves, to others, and our society as we connect across social boundaries. This project allows us to powerfully share the magic of the artistic process and positively influence the youth to see their own dreams and empower them to purse something that inspires them and even seek help to get out of their current situations. The artists see what they have been blind to and are able to form new perspectives and get past judgments they have on the homeless.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Lesson 1 Youth will continue to live on the streets if no one is there to guide or mentor them. Someone to motivate a young person that they CAN achieve a goal is important. Having a one on one interaction where the youth actually get seen as a person instead of put into the dehumanizing category “homeless”.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "1. Invite Artists: First, invitations to professional artists working in any/all mediums in Los Angeles will be asked to participate to work with a youth of My Friend’s Place (the goal is to get about 80-100 different artists signed up). Once signed up, the artists will get a livescan (background check) done before coming into the center to work with the youth.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "1. Rates of volunteerism & % of Angelenos that volunteer informally",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Having implemented this project two times in the last year (with a very small budget) we exceeded our goals for the first and second show in the amount of participation and the work created. I know implementing it in the next 12 months is beyond achievable with our network of artists here in Los Angeles and the excitement around creating art and self expression. With My Friend’s Place having the space for the artists to come in to work with the youth, I know that a secure space is ready for the creation of the portraits to be made. My Friend’s Place also sees about 100 youth a day, many of which, are excited to create art already and use art as a form of self expression.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One major challenge with this project is having some of the youth stay around long enough to finish their portrait of their partner. To ensure there will be enough portrait pairs to display I have set up to invite many more artists to come in than needs to complete a traveling show. Another strategy for this is to also let the artists know ahead of time that their partner may not come back to work with them a second time and that they may need to partner up with a second youth at the drop-in center. A third action we have in place is to have them try to create their portraits with their partner on the first session or create a collaborative piece together.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Mirror, Mirror Project starts with one simple idea-- to see one another--face to face. Mirror, Mirror sits us directly in front of a homeless epidemic we nearly ignore, and ourselves--so we can take a look at what we have been overlooking. Without the security of our studio walls, Mirror, Mirror welcomes professional artists and homeless youth to sit across from each other and see how creating portraits of the other makes us each the same--human beings."

In 2010, we hosted two summits where over 40 organizations from diverse sectors participated including representation from labor, community organizing, environmental justice, transit equity, and affordable housing developers. Founding organizations remain active host committee members today and the coalition has 22 active member organizations.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "ACT-LA members have extensive track records of neighborhood, regional, and statewide wins in their respective areas of expertise. The groups have also worked with each other in different formations as well as part of other collaborations. A recurring theme was a loss of connection to neighborhood work as transit oriented development policy was being developed at all levels and resources aligned to support those policies. From our collective experience, a lesson learned was the loss of community residents in the policy development process. This is why our project focuses on engaging residents, deepening their knowledge on issues and making the spaces to discuss areas that can be perceived as conflicting.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The homeless population in LA County is 58,000 and growing. Concentrated in large part on Skid Row, nearly 1/4 are women.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Through our business coalition, we aim to overcome the challenge of businesses being unwilling to consider women who have been homeless for employment. In the execution of this project, we anticipate facing challenges that typically affect our population because of the nature of their situation: housing instability, health problems, difficulties with performing, and emotional roadblocks. To overcome these challenges, our Job Development team will provide assistance both to the employer and the employee, facilitating dialogue and problem solving in situations of conflict. We will provide trainings for new business partners, and connect them to long-time partners within the business coalition who are also able to offer peer support. We will thus leverage our current partnerships to help efficiently create new and successful ones. Lastly, because our proposed project makes part of a larger net of services provided to homeless women, the support we give to participants of this project will always be holistic and address the multi-faceted challenges that go along with extreme poverty.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will measure success by evaluating the following: the number of participating businesses, number of positions made available for women, and number of women who become employed. During the grant period, we will aim to place 60 women in jobs or internships and connect with 20 new business partners. 75% of women placed in full or part-time employment will stay employed for six months or longer; 50% of those women will stay employed for at least a year. 90% of women placed in training will complete their programs.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Solutions must be integrated into the fabric of the economy—not just stand outside aiding those who have been expelled from it. DWC has been advocating for homeless women since 1978. We know that permanent supportive housing and wraparound services are effective long-term solutions. We also know that it is monumentally important to foster a sense of dignity and respect among our participants and that systemic change is required for a permanent end to homelessness.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "The core of creation is the exercise of agency. DWC’s Education and Job Readiness Program empowers women to exercise their agency while our proposed local business coalition encourages businesses to emerge as leaders in the community by effecting positive change. The task at hand is to create the city we envision for 2050 and this project represents a strategic way to engage the wielders of power and the disenfranchised to move forward—together—to make a better LA.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "1.\tBuild a business coalition",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This project will directly benefit homeless women on Skid Row. There are 58,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, and most of that population is concentrated in downtown Los Angeles. Women make up almost a quarter Los Angeles’ homeless. The women DWC serve include war veterans, older women who find themselves homeless after their spouse passes, victims of the economic downturn, and trauma survivors. The 2013 Needs Assessment, conducted by the Downtown Women’s Action Coalition, surveyed women on Skid Row to get a better idea of the services needed. Employment opportunities ranked among the highest needed resource in Skid Row. Computer classes and educational opportunities also ranked high on the list of needs for women in our community.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Confirmed partners include Strategic Action for a Just Economy, Groundwork Coffeee, Bloomingdale’s, Evy, UCLA School of Nursing, Dr. J’s Vibrant Café, The Pie Hole, ROC-LA, and LA Kitchen. We are aiming to forge partnerships with Farmer John, Charlie’s Brownies, Sonax Behrouzon’s Printing Company, Povertees, Nancy Clark (Designer), The Giving Keys, Wells Fargo, Dean Management, LLC, Manifesto Café, Wurstkuche, and Piece by Piece.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "This program creates access to jobs for the most vulnerable population in Los Angeles, shrinks they Gini coefficient by targeting the most extreme poverty, and empowers local businesses to shape the culture and economic growth in downtown Los Angeles.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "DWC has been a pioneer, creating what is now considered the best-practice model for serving homeless women. Our recent successes includes expanding our permanent supportive housing from 47 to 119 units in 2010, and in 2013, obtaining the California’s “Nonprofit of the Year” title, conferred by Governor Brown for our ability to leverage volunteers in service of our organization.",

In fact, by most accounts we are 150 years overdue for the “Big One,” an earthquake of a magnitude 7.8 or higher. If an earthquake this size jolts the lower half of the San Andreas Fault, this could mean thousands of lives lost, billions of dollars in property damage, close to a half a million businesses and 4.5 million workers impacted; potentially crippling the area’s economy.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Currently, Community Ambassadors represent more than 100 communities throughout Los Angeles County, with more Community Ambassadors being selected every quarter: Playa Vista, Del Rey, Marina Del Rey, Venice, Pasadena, Altadena, South Pasadena, East Pasadena, San Marino, San Pasqual, Alhambra, San Gabriel, South San Gabriel, East San Gabriel, La Cañada Flintridge, Arcadia, Whittier Narrows, El Monte, North El Monte, South El Monte, Temple City, Rosemead, Monrovia, Bradbury, Sierra Madre, Duarte, Mayflower Village, Baldwin Park, Claremont, Industry, Pomona, La Verne, San Dimas, West San Dimas, Ramona, Glendora, Azusa, Citrus, Vincent, West Covina, Valinda, West Puente Valley, La Puente, Hacienda Heights, North Whittier, Avocado Heights, Diamond Bar, South Diamond Bar, Rowland Heights, Walnut, Charter Oak, Irwindale, South San Jose Hills, Lancaster, Leona Valley, Northeast Antelope Valley, Northwest Antelope Valley, Palmdale, Northwest Palmdale, Quartz Hill, Sun Village, Acton, Lake Los Angeles, Desert View Highlands, Littlerock, Southeast Antelope Valley, Angeles Crest, Agua Dulce, Green Valley, Elizabeth Lake, Lake Hughes, Glendale, Atwater Village, Glassell Park, Cypress Park, Mount Washington, Highland Park, Eagle Rock, Montecito Heights, Vermont-Slauson, Hyde Park, Vermont Knolls, University Park, Exposition Park, Leimert Park, Jefferson Park, West Adams, Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw, Hawthorne, El Segundo, San Pedro, Harbor City, Harbor Gateway, Hermosa Beach, Gardena, Monterey Park, Covina, Van Nuys, Valley Glen, Valley Village, Culver City, West Los Angeles, Santa Clarita, La Crescenta, Inglewood, Lakewood, Cerritos, Whittier, Long Beach, Manhattan Beach, Santa Monica, Torrance, Redondo Beach, Compton, Cambodian Community in Long Beach, La Mirada, Montebello, Rancho Palos Verdes, Palos Verdes Estates, Rolling Hills, and Rolling Hills Estates.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "We also believe in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region. In terms of community resilience, the future is in our hands more than we realize. We are long overdue for the “Big One” — a catastrophic earthquake that is predicted to wreak havoc. Consensus among experts is that LA residents in the event of a catastrophic earthquake will need to be prepared to take care of themselves for 3 to 7 days until outside help arrives. Our idea is to implement a community engagement project that incorporates a neighbor-to-neighbor preparedness approach as well as a preparedness smart phone app in an effort to create a more connected, and therefore resilient LA. It is after all in the coming together that we are strongest.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Lesson 1: Conveying preparedness information using a peer-to-peer approach is the most effective tactic. The Community Ambassador Program has been such a success because our ambassadors are passionate about protecting and preparing the neighborhoods where they live and work. This passion is highly contagious. Other community members often volunteer or take preparedness action that they see modeled by a fellow member of their community. The Map Your Neighborhood neighbor-to- neighbor approach should also prove true the “keeping up with the Jones’” theory true as well.",

    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Our project plan will combine some old-fashioned community networking via Map Your Neighborhood with new technology via the Team Red Cross App.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The following on-going partnerships will support the implementation of our new project: Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Washington State Emergency Management System, Community Police Advisory Board, City of Los Angeles Office of Emergency Management, LA County Office of Emergency Management, Neighborhood Councils, and Emergency Network Los Angeles. These partners offer additional preparedness training, cross-promote programs and services, serve in a program advisory capacity, help identify new Community Ambassadors, work with Community Ambassadors to identify Neighborhood Councils and community-based organizations who need preparedness presentations. Three factors critical to our success of these collaborations are: shared mission; continual dialogue about best practices; and exchange of ideas, promotion and training programs.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "As we have found firsthand during this third full year of the Community Ambassador Program, it is true in practice what social scientists report: people become more motivated to take preparedness action is when they see other people taking preparedness action, especially their peers; and that together, a community is able to manage challenges that go beyond what any unaffiliated group of individuals can accomplish. To date our community ambassadors reach 102 communities throughout Los Angeles County with the goal of reaching all 272 in time. As a result, thousands of young people and adults have attended preparedness events and classes run or organized by Community Ambassadors and have also received or built preparedness kits. Community Ambassadors have also helped increase the number of Red Cross volunteers to a total of 8,000. Additionally, Community Ambassadors have worked with their elected officials to facilitate the signing of 32 preparedness proclamations. With this solid program framework in place along with our strong program partnerships, implementing our new preparedness strategy within the next year is achievable.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Challenge 1: The vast majority of LA residents understand conceptually that disasters happen all of the time and that the “Big One” is very likely to happen; and yet, there is a disconnect between this understanding and actually joining in the conversation and taking action to prepare. The neighbor-to-neighbor Map Your Neighborhood approach is effective because hearing preparedness information from a peer tends to resonate, and seeing a neighbor take preparedness action to protect his/her family tends to inspire others to also take action.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Through both the launch of Map Your Neighborhood and the Team Red Cross App, many more Los Angeles residents will learn a great deal more about the Red Cross’s five lines of service, Disaster Relief, Service to the Armed Forces, Blood Services, Preparedness Health & Safety, and International Services, and will often want to get more involved in a program that inspires them. More Community Ambassadors, Red Cross volunteers, will be recruited through this work as well. As neighbors work on Map Your Neighborhood together, more residents will volunteer their time to achieve the key components of the initiative will likely to engage with their local CERT team, neighborhood block associations and councils.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Urban Air is a public artwork that also puts an active face on the possibility of urban sustainability. Urban Air will bring an urgency and vibrancy to the civic landscape, inspire community dialogue and action, beautify transit corridors, and ultimately connect people. Much like a modern city, bamboo is at once both vertical and horizontal. Each culm is connected to and sustained by the others through a vast rhizome network. Like streets, mass transit, or electrical grids in a modern city, everything and everyone is connected. The health of any individual within such a system is ultimately dependent on the health of the system as a whole. Urban Air will contribute to the overall health of Los Angeles.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",

    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Urban-scaled purposeful artworks as networked atmospheric monitors — fuse good art and good science to the global commercial infrastructure",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "During the design and prep phase Urban Air will erect the pilot or prototype greenboard in Los Angeles — ideally in Q1 2015. Summit Media has already guaranteed donation of the media site for the Urban Air prototype. This pilot installation will serve multiple ends: 1) it will allow us to do real-world testing of the technologies, designs and construction techniques before rolling out to other target sites; 2) it will provide an engine to build velocity for marketing and promotion — telling the Urban Air story; and 3) it allows Urban Air to market its successful Kickstarter campaign, which generated over 21,000 blog posts and articles, 150,000 downloads of video, and over 600,000 social media impressions.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Urban Air is a project that transforms existing urban billboards into living, suspended bamboo gardens. By using the billboard — the exclusive language and tool of commercial messaging — Urban Air is designed to provide powerful possibilities for public/private partnerships in the green economy, and to inspire dialog around urban blight/green space, climate change and climate science.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The barriers between Art, Commerce, Science, Public, and Private have led us to an ongoing vicious circle of competing and mutually limiting dialogues. Urban Air sparks a new context, where commercial, aesthetic, environmental, and social values fuse as a powerful and unique public entity. Urban Blight is recontextualized s a serviceable infrastructure, and advertising becomes a beautiful service, and opaque messaging becomes transparent nodes of interconnectivity.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "pilot installation and rollout",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Working creatively on a large scale in the public realm is always a challenge. Lead Artist Stephen Glassman has a long history and substantial portfolio creating and producing high concept, large scale, structural artworks in the public domain. He understands navigating this frontier.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Urban Air will be a positive landmark for all immediate passersby, as well as a major social media hub. Climate monitoring, social media wifi broadcasting, and public private partnering will foster a robust local and global dialogue. Profound questions and solutions will actively be proposed and powerfully exist in the civic landscape. Not only is there the inherent values of service and beauty, but the value that can be created through social media participation and connectivity will be vast. It is the intention of Urban Air to partner with the Clinton Foundation's C40 climate initiative, and LA is a C40 city. Urban Air will become a symbol of LA's green apirations and policies, and be the first in the worl to launch a global program.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The following collaborators are all confirmed and been on board 6 months to 2 years",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Urban Air reimagines one of the prime symbols of urban commercial messaging as a powerful public/private partnership in service of climate science and the green economy, inspiring dialog around urban blight/green space and climate change. Urban Air sites are embedded with proprietary sensor technologies measuring CO2 levels and other key atmospheric gases in and around the billboard’s cloud forest. Each “greenboard” is a local node in a networked array of sensors provided through partnership with the BEACO2N atmospheric observation project. Urban Air is also a platform for social engagement and as urban nodes - and also as virtual hangouts broadcasting free Urban Air WiFi as location services in mobile apps and other social media.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The first and most important measure of success is a prominent, fully produced and realized Urban Air billboard at a significant intersection or at a major thoroughfare in Los Angeles by the end of 2013. However, its realization alone is only the beginning of the equation. As the piece is intended to be a catalyst, the impact it generates is of equal, if not greater importance. Urban Air must inspire widespread and formidable dialogue, a matrix that can be tracked to some extent through media coverage. Likewise the amount of interest and inquiry by other cities to create like projects will indicate a measure of success. As has been done to date, we will note success in the ability of Urban Air to inspire academic curriculums, generate college classes and workshops, and stimulate other professional collaborations and artistic endeavors. An important evaluation will be the goal of shifting the edges and territories of art, building, and infrastructure in the public realm. For example, Arup Engineering is already beginning in-house conversations to explore the possibility of public building – both art and architecture – as possible creative and beautiful solutions to a greener urban future."

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Law Soup LA is a web-based resource that provides news and information for L.A. County residents and visitors about their legal rights and responsibilities, and empowers the public to participate in the democratic process. Primarily, it involves a website which contains L.A. County focused news stories and blog posts related to law and government; a database of key laws that affect L.A. area residents most, and useful information about such laws; as well as interactive features. One such feature allows users of the site to draft and post a law they believe should be enacted, and others in the community can “like” the proposed law and comment on it. Proposed laws are ranked by \"likes\" and those with the most likes are prominently displayed!",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Law Soup LA is a web-based resource that provides L.A. County residents with a fun way to understand the law and participate in democracy.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We have already taken preliminary steps to implement the project, including creating a sample of the basic structure of the website and much of the content, and developing a detailed plan to complete the initial implementation. To fully implement the project, we will hire a web designer, a communications/community outreach director, and content editors. We will then finish the initial design and content of the website, and begin outreach, using social media and print media, as well as local events to create buzz about the project.

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Because Law Soup LA will facilitate online and offline engagement in the community as well as democratic participation, the project will likely have the most direct impact on the above indicated metrics, though it may also have an indirect impact on those metrics not checked.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will consider the project successful if after one year the website attracts a significant amount of unique visitors, and the facebook and twitter accounts gain a significant number of followers. Specifically, we will consider the website a success if at least 12,000 L.A. County residents use the site at least once during the first year, or if we have at least 1,000 monthly active users (MAUs). We also hope to attract at least 1,000 facebook and 1,000 twitter followers in the first year.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The first lesson that has informed the creation of Law Soup LA is that more people than ever are being excluded from access to justice. As a licensed California attorney, I have seen the increased need for legal services, and the unfortunate inability of the legal system to meet those needs. Due to increased caseloads at pro bono law firms which exceed capacity and funds, the legal system is not adequately meeting the needs of the most vulnerable, as well as much of the middle class who increasingly cannot afford legal services. While Law Soup LA is not intended to replace legal services, it will go a long way towards reducing the need for these services. Much of the legal problems that people encounter are preventable with simple and accessible legal information.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Law Soup LA will help people quickly understand what the law entitles them to and what the law expects of them, as well as how they can take action to exercise their rights and advocate for an expansion of rights. By providing this information in an easily accessible, fun and engaging way, and empowering people to take part in proposing and advancing their own ideas about laws for their community, the project is likely to have great success in making LA the best place to connect, today and in the future.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Law Soup LA is designed to benefit all people within L.A. County, and does so by making its information about the law and government free and accessible to all those who can access an internet connection. However, because lower-income and lesser-educated people often have minimal access to justice and have less information about their rights, Law Soup LA stands to benefit these groups the most.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have already taken preliminary steps to implement the project, including creating a sample of the basic structure of the website and much of the content, and developing a detailed plan to complete the initial implementation.

This will in turn create opportunities for other organizations to come into town to plant in the ground that we have helped to furrow and cultivate. Additionally, the restaurants, shops, bars and clubs of San Pedro will all benefit if increased traffic come through San Pedro in search of the arts.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Our first barrier is location. San Pedro is not well known in Los Angeles as an artistic haven. We might find it difficult to attract artists from farther north in LA (NoHo, Santa Monica, Pasadena, etc.). This can be combated by offering the scholarships based on need and the students commute (though perhaps not exclusively). We have found that students will travel almost any distance to get excellent training that feeds them artistically. Once we promote this aspect and open their eyes to San Pedro and the art that it houses we believe that this challenge will be solved.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "For today, LA needs an unabashed arts district that is not tied to nor unduly influenced by the Hollywood film business. It needs a place where theatrical art and artists can grow and challenge themselves without the taint of Hollywood's glitz and glamour. The artists who train and work with us are held to the highest standards of professionalism and artistry, helping to build and sustain a culture of dedication and art that is often (though not always) lacking in Los Angeles.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Certainly we will be able to employ more artists in our theatre than would otherwise be possible, and at closer to a living wage than is usual for theatre in LA. This extends to technicians, designers, and other positions as well.",

Through high standards of excellence we build our reputation to bring credit and a good name to San Pedro and the surrounding areas as an arts district. This includes seeking and partnering with an increasingly large group of internationally known artists, as well as fostering relationships with LA's growing theatre community.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The first lesson was learned through experience. The two founding directors of Theatrum Elysium came out of Harvard's MFA acting program and before that, through NYU's Tisch School and the University of Wyoming's BFA conservatory. The final stage of their training took place in Moscow, Russia at the Moscow Art Theatre School. This is the place that gave birth to everything we know and understand about acting, theatre.",

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1. The Games Organizing Committee (GOC) operates in tandem with Special Olympics Southern California (SOSC) to ensure LA2015 doesn’t derail existing local Special Olympic programs and partners. Much of the legacy left behind from LA2015 will benefit SOSC, therefore it is in their interest to work together. The goal is to identify and reach communities within the Los Angeles region where Special Olympics programs currently do not exist. SOSC have loaned senior executives to LA2015 to solidify these collaborations.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",

LA2015 will require the skills of 157 paid staff, 220 student interns, plus 30,000 volunteers. Our anticipated costs over a four-year period ending December 2015 are expected to total $74 million. Some of that will be covered with corporate sponsorships, Opening Ceremony tickets, and merchandise sales, as well contributed services and donated product. But $30 million will come from foundations, government and individuals.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1.\tThe power of sport is humanity’s greatest equalizer. Through participation and observation people with differences come together for fun. Experiences through sport are typically held onto and can be applied to other challenges in life. The athletes of the Special Olympics have shown that sports training and competition benefits people with intellectual disabilities physically, mentally, socially and spiritually. Prior to this discovery people with Intellectual disabilities never had the opportunity to discover the sense of determination, team, courage and joy that comes with competition. Sport has driven the Special Olympic movement for fifty years.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Deloitte continues to be an important partner for the GOC and is currently working on two projects with a third ready to launch in late June/early July. The first project is creating a Master Scheduling Tool that integrates the competition schedule, awards schedule, non-competition schedule (special events), & operations schedule into one “cloud-based” user-friendly format. This tool can be accessed through any mobile or internet connected device, has an easy to use interface, and tracks important details for each event (times, location, responsible person, etc.), as well as highlights potential conflicts.

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The most difficult part of the project is growing the online community until it becomes a sustainable system on its own.

I had initially reached out three non-profits, all of whom turned me down. Finally, I found the amazing art project coordinator at Lamp Community who fully supported the idea. When the collaboration did happen, it was beautiful to see the different styles merge together, especially between the professionals and the Skid Row artists.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We plan on implementing this idea by first developing a fully functional interface where the organizations can upload the work. Account management will be done within our servers through either WooCommerce or a platform like Shopify. Payouts to the organizations will happen twice a month - we always makes sure that all sales are fully transparent to the account holders and their associated accounts. Much like Society6.com, we hope to offer prints and original artwork for sale (the major difference being we will deal specifically with underprivileged artists). A web developer will set up an API feed between the site and our manufacturing and printing partners so fulfillment can be instantly handled. Eventually, manufacturing and printing will all be managed in-house.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "SFCLA’s fresh produce pantry project will help make LA the healthiest place to live today by providing free groceries filled with fresh produce and balanced, nutritious ingredients, many of which are hard to come by at other pantries.

Through our residency there, we practiced at their studio in exchange for offering free classes and performing for their congregants. CMDC was able to pilot our Dance Leadership Program due to the incredible in-kind donation of space provided to us by IPC. In 2013, due to financial challenges, the church could no longer continue our partnership. In looking for new space, we reached out to Studio A Dance in Silverlake. We began holding our self-produced shows at Studio A in 2011. Finding an appropriate theater venue that was affordable was our biggest challenge. Unless a dance company is booking or touring, it must self-produce its own work and self-producing can be a very expensive undertaking in Los Angeles. Studio A was affordable and the studio owner worked with us on a low-cost rate. We decided to partner up again with Studio A this year to and now hold all our classes and rehearsals there.

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "In the past, a high school diploma opened doors to skilled jobs and middle-class economic opportunity. Today college has become a critical step to achieving stable employment and financial security. Despite efforts to improve college access, fewer than 40% of LA high school graduates attend college.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "Over the past 25 years, Los Angeles (along with the rest of California) has fallen in US rankings and now lags behind many other areas in the production of college graduates. Based on forecasts by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEM), it is projected that 41% of jobs in 2025 in California will require a college degree. Absent any significant improvements, NCHEM projects that only 37 percent of workers in California will have a college degree in 2025. The gap between the demands of the local economy and the supply of college-educated workers represents a serious impediment to an economically successful future for LA.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) encompasses 130 middle and 149 high schools serving 112,749 and 138,778 students, respectively. LAUSD charter schools serve an additional 95,207 students. FutureBound’s goal is to extend game-based college access tools to all students in LAUSD’s middle and high schools. As a secondary population, we will also target other school districts in the LA region such as Inglewood and Culver City.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The primary potential barrier to the success of our implementation is the acceptance of educational video games by teachers and educators.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "In order to measure the success of our project we will partner with USC’s Pullias Center for Higher Education. Previous research illustrated that by playing FutureBound’s games, students demonstrated significant increases in college-going self-efficacy (the belief that they could attend college) and growth of college knowledge (understanding of college terms, strategies, and processes). Since we already know that these tools are effective when students play them, our evaluation of our LA2050 initiative will focus on how well the games have been disseminated, implemented, and received across LA. We will use several metrics and perform this evaluation throughout the year so that we can maximize the reach of the games and their usefulness to students.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We believe the most effective approach to engaging students and achieving the goals described above involves connecting with youth across multiple learning environments, including schools, college preparation and community-based organizations, and libraries. The primary goal associated with these collaborations will be to leverage their direct experience with and access to students and educators. An additional goal of these partnerships will be to leverage the recognition and public awareness associated with their organizations and services, as well as to create new positive associations for the combined offerings.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "FutureBound’s games are an effort to reach out to underserved young people and help them understand the complex processes that govern their future education. These games give teachers, counselors, and parents tools that provide invaluable information to high school and middle school students using a medium that they're comfortable with and ready to engage with. Playing these games builds students' college-going aspirations and self-confidence, helping them picture themselves as successful college students and understand the steps they need to take to make that future a reality. This, in turn, affects the ambition that they demonstrate in school and in after-school activities.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Lesson #1",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Our games have been developed, are effective, and have been successfully used with many schools and students across the country. For our proposed project, the primary activity and goal will be the wide-scale and strategic distribution of our games in order to maximize the number of students we can assist in learning about college and expanding their access to college information and support.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "FutureBound’s mission is to create a suite of fun, inspiring, and educational games that will increase the number of youth preparing for, applying to, and finding success in college. FutureBound’s games are a research-based and highly innovative effort to ensure postsecondary educational opportunities for all students, particularly those from low-income households. Since 2009, FutureBound (formerly known as Collegeology) has been working with students and educators in its quest to design useful, effective, and fun games about college. To date, FutureBound has created three games: FutureBound, Mission: Admission, and Graduate Strike Force.",

It travels through inland to coastal climatic zones, and habitat. The Expo Safari line travels the path of the undergrounded braided river bed of Ballona Creek, the drainage conduit to the Ballona Watershed! Tree canopies provide flyways, habitat and bird rest stops that connect the Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek into a continuous system for migrating birds as part of the Pacific Flyway.

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Authentic community begins with good conversation. It acts as a primer to a larger sense of connectedness and builds trust—in each other, in neighbourhoods, in the city we live in.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The impact is very personal and communal for anyone who shows up. There are numerous barriers to access the kind of safe format necessary to practice these important skills of authentic connection and community creation: the courage to show up, to speak, to really listen, and to walk in each others shoes. Where do we as a whole society get to strengthen these challenging practices deliberately?",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "We hope that once a large number of Los Angelenos have a fun and safe way to come together and engage meaningfully face-to-face, over a meal, we will begin to recognize talking to strangers as a social currency. Feelings of general goodwill and community participation are likely to follow.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "At NationBuilder, we’ve learned that stories are the key to organizing. They give meaning to our experiences and help us connect with other people. In sharing our stories with each other, we’ve become more than a company—we’ve become a community.

Would-Works CREATES a vibrant program highlighting a forward-thinking environment present in Los Angeles which can be a role-model for the rest of the country. We are proud of what we have achieved as a small organization so far, but we are ready to grow and have a larger influence.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "In Los Angeles, 254,000 men, women and children experience homelessness during some part of the year and approximately 82,000 are homeless on any given night, according to the Institute for the Study of Homelessness and Poverty (Weingart Center, 2014). In the Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles, over 5,000 are homeless. Further, 65% of the adults in Skid Row live on less than $10,000 a year. This is the population that Would-Works seeks to help. Would-Works addresses both the causes and the impacts of poverty and homelessness by helping people overcome barriers to employment and permanent housing by working to meet their own needs while becoming more employable in the process. With funding from LA2050, Would-Works will be able to focus on expanding the model. More workshops will be held; not only in Skid Row but also in additional areas and serving additional population groups. Would-Works has explored growth within several population groups. For example; the young adult population that has aged out of the foster system is a specific group that is in need of resources. By identifying specific groups, Would-Works can tailor the model to maximize impact on population segments.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Because of the structure of the Would-Works model, evaluation is simple. By reporting the number of Artisans who enter the program and the number of goals completed, Would-Works can track outcomes and social impact of the program. Further, Would-Works is working on a tracking system that will follow up with Artisans after they leave the program to ascertain how many have secured employment and/or permanent housing. This follow-up will determine the effectiveness of the program in each segment and help determine where Would-Works should concentrate. Through partnering with service agencies, Would-Works will be an integral part of lessening the negative effects of poverty in Los Angeles.",

Would-Works has tested and refined an approach that is now ready to grow. With funding from LA2050 Would-Works will secure permanent space in which to hold workshops, hold them more often, develop a marketing approach that will keep product sales robust, establish partnerships with relevant groups and enterprises and continue to develop products.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We understand that to end an individual’s homelessness, we need to work with a number of partners.

A disproportionately high number of individuals who are homeless have also been incarcerated and Would-Works provides an opportunity for these individuals as well. Would-Works plans to grow from a small, bootstrapped start-up and sell products nationally. We see our organization covering many LA2050 categories such as LIVE and LEARN and PLAY, but we are most focused how we can CREATE opportunities.",

    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Would-Works provides men and women living in poverty the dignity of working to meet their own needs. We strive to alleviate immediate financial stress by providing a way for people to earn money for a specific goal related to moving into permanent housing or maintaining housing.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Because Would-Works was started and has grown modestly through bootstrap funding over the last two years, the time is right for significant growth. All systems and processes are in place and ready for the infusion of funds necessary to take the tiny program to a much larger audience. With funding from LA2050 Would-Works will begin immediately to put its growth plan in place. Moving from an average of 45 individuals achieving goals per year, Would-Works will move toward a goal of 450 Artisan goals achieved in a year, or ten-fold growth."

    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "As the coalition of business, labor and environmental groups instrumental in getting the Measure R half-cent sales tax on the ballot in 2008 — the game-changing investment in transit referred to above — Move LA has street cred in building coalitions and consensus. Every year since Measure R won (with 67% of the vote!) our coalition has gathered at an annual “transportation conversation” that draws elected officials, agency leaders and other influencers as well as ordinary citizens. The 500-plus people who come together are champions of more sustainable and affordable transportation and housing choices in walkable, bikeable neighborhoods.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "With transformational transit investments: Southern California has long been infamous as a place without a center, growing ever outward into a disorganized, disaggregated, diverse region that sprawls over 191 cities and 38,000 square miles of heavily trafficked roads and single-family neighborhoods. The distance between jobs and housing — especially affordable housing — has exacerbated not only traffic and air pollution but also a lack of social cohesion. We spend so much time driving we barely have time for family and friends, and until fairly recently it was unlikely very many Angelenos would connect on public transit, in public spaces, or while walking or biking down the street. Investment in transit, bike lanes and wider sidewalks, however, is changing the tenor of life in our neighborhoods, providing a landscape where we can watch the parade of life go by and literally bump into each other, providing a sense of shared space and civic culture.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "NationBuilder and a digital media strategist are the partners we believe are essential to making this larger outreach and engagement effort as robust as possible -- we have signed a contract with NationBuilder and are interviewing strategists now. Our goal is to use a digital media platform to leverage all our partnerships in order to collaborate with as many people as possible. Move LA began as a coalition of business, labor and environmental interests working in collaboration with government agencies and elected officials, and the coalition has continued to expand to include: faith-based organizations, public health advocates, bike and pedestrian activists, tenants rights activists, academics, affordable housers, design professionals, architects, developers, student organizations, community-based groups, neighborhood organizations, and funders.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "It should be relatively simple, using the analytics that a digital media platform like NationBuilder makes possible, to determine the extent to which we have broadened our reach. We can easily keep track of how many people open our emails, how many we have engaged in online discussions, and how many have not only opened our emails but also clicked through and taken action — such as signing a letter or petition, liking or re-tweeting us or donating to Move LA. We can count our Twitter followers and our friends on Facebook, and the people who attend our next transportation conversation — will it top our best attendance, a standing-room-only crowd of more than 600? We can assess the traffic to our website, subscriptions to our monthly newsletter, and number of comments on our blog. We can assess whether we have truly built support for investment in more transportation options and housing where people of all ages and incomes can live by the numbers of people who sign our petitions, donate or take other actions on social media.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We believe that bringing LA County to a consensus around a development program for transit is totally doable and that key elements are already in place. We have a credible coalition that has stayed together and that keeps getting bigger, we have a big list of supporters, a great work program and a great pitch about the enormous potential of reinventing Los Angeles County as a more equitable and sustainable place. We have already begun a real-time outreach and engagement program, we have a contract with NationBuilder, and we have the conviction that digital engagement will succeed in amplifying our ability to reach out and involve more citizens. We see this digital strategy as a tool for implementing our larger goal of building a consensus around the next big investment in transit, and we’ve begun talking with several seasoned digital strategists who are eager to work with us. Having identified a chink in our armor — the expertise and technology that we lack — the only thing that’s holding us back is the lack of funds to bring a digital strategist to our team.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Game-changing transportation investment is transforming Los Angeles County and it’s just the beginning! Transportation is the spine around which cities get built and investments in transit, walking and biking can reinvent neighborhoods, making our county a more sustainable, healthy and prosperous place. Move LA is like the Johnny Appleseed of transit — we are seeding a countywide public conversation about what to build next and to find out which ideas take root. This conversation couldn’t be more fundamental to LA’s future. We ask you to help us fund a digital media campaign that allows us to engage more Angelenos and prompt them to contribute meaningfully to this civic process. LA is a big place. We need to work together to make it great.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Connecting the people of Los Angeles County around a sustainable transportation and neighborhood agenda will benefit everyone — because we all sit in the same traffic, breathe the same air, and feel the impact of global warming. Sustainable transportation and development can reduce all this negative fallout even as the population grows — meantime increasing access to opportunity in terms of jobs, education, fresh food, health care, entertainment, culture, parks and recreation, our friends and neighbors. Moreover, the zero- and near-zero emission technologies we are promoting will allow us to move freight to and from the ports without having to sentence those who live along our heavily trafficked goods movement corridors to intolerably high rates of asthma and other chronic illness.",

    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Lesson #1: It has become increasingly clear that a large government agency like LA Metro, with its diverse board, has great difficulty engaging people at the grassroots. Metro does a good job of reaching out to a neighborhood when a new station is proposed, and a good job of reaching out to cities through their councils of government in order to get input on projects they want funded. But Metro is less adept at reaching out to people across the county in order to involve them in shaping the next round of transit investments. We have concluded that it's much easier for nongovernmental organizations, like Move LA, to dream big about what can be accomplished and to engage people in that discussion.",

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate.

Move LA has achieved success organizing and communicating the old-fashioned way — via telephone, in-person meetings, emails, direct mail, a canvass. Our staff believes there aren’t enough hours in the day to dedicate time to Twitter and Facebook, especially because most of our colleagues in government either don’t engage via social media or delegate these activities to their staff. Dedicating time to being active on social media and to cultivating dialogue on blogs will take some getting used to, but we recognize that even online relationships take time and consistent effort. We do believe, however, that if we are able to hire a digital strategist who can help us see this investment of time and energy in the context of a larger digital media plan with goals and analytics to track and measure our success that we’ll see the value of our efforts."

We will need 1-2 months for outreach and selection of filmmakers, 1 month for screenwriting and notes, two months for pre-production, a month for production, and 3 months for post production. Our administrators will be connecting resources, maintaining online presence and preparing for distribution throughout the year. We are excited about the 1 year challenge and believe it is consistent with timelines given to film students at top film schools.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "There maybe push-back from those who think helping minorities and women is \"reverse racism\". We will ensure that everyone knows this is a community wide project that can include the support from all types of members. We will encourage a wide variety of volunteers, production workers, and collaborators in order to support the aim of this project.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "We propose to make a series of short films by cutting edge Women of Color in LA for the purpose of exposing their talent and capabilities to hiring executives, the LA public and online community. We will select the filmmakers, help produce, fund, and distribute the films.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Short films made in the program that get into national and international film festivals will lead to positive exposure and possible funding of feature length films to show off The City of Los Angeles."

    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "The Los Angeles Campaign for Grade Level Reading equips families with fun and inspiring school readiness and out-of-school learning tools.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "In 2013, the national Campaign for Grade-Level Reading invited FIS to serve as the coordinating agency of the LA GLR Campaign, targeting three challenges to students’ reading success that are consequential and amenable to community solutions:",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Providing quality literacy services is important to FIS as part of our larger mission. FIS will evaluate the Campaign to gauge impact on students’ school readiness and involvement in out of school time learning activities. We will examine program participation rates in both MWC and PTS. For MWC, parents sign off on their children’s reading logs; for PTS, the museums stamp the family passports, independently verifying that the family participated in the activity. In addition, we ask parents to complete an in-depth survey that addresses school readiness elements, and out of school time learning. School readiness areas assessed include time spent reading, level of inquisitiveness, interest in learning and physical activity; the out of school time questions include amount of time spent reading, watching television and engaging in active play. For Passport to Success, parents are asked to identify the site at which their child learned the most and explain why.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The L.A. Campaign for Grade Level Reading is partially executed through two existing literacy and summer learning campaigns: the Million Word Challenge and Passport to Success which have been running for 13 and 3 years respectively. Given our strong track record of success in implementing both programs, we are confident that our goal is highly feasible. The creation of the Campaign Steering Committee, with stronger connections to the education and business communities, further expands our capacity to achieve our goal.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Campaign is a countywide initiative that is focused on improving third-grade reading proficiency, the strongest predictor of high school graduation. With 66% of LA County 3rd graders testing below proficient in English Language Arts on the 2013 CA Standards Test, LA County is experiencing an educational crisis. Students from low income families are disproportionately affected creating a deep achievement gap. GLR will address that gap through initiatives that will empower parents with the skills, resources and confidence to support their children’s learning. Through the Million Word Challenge and Passport to Success, FIS provides access to educational resources for families in high need communities.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "The Campaign will help make LA the best place to learn today by showing students and families that the entire community is an educational playground and learning is not just a formal, structured activity limited to a classroom. The initiative is not simply about increasing reading proficiency, it is also about creating the community conditions that support parents’ efforts to be actively engaged in their children’s learning. By engaging parents in accessible, inclusive, non-intimidating and fun out-of-school programs, FIS helps parents create a love of learning in their children that will last throughout their lives.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Campaign seeks to increase the number of low-income LA County students of color who are reading at grade level by the end of 3rd-grade by impacting 150,000 students. Los Angeles County is facing an educational crisis. As aforementioned there is a significant gap in reading proficiency between low-income students and their more economically advantaged peers. Up until 3rd grade, children are mastering the art of reading. From 3rd grade forward, reading is the key to learning. When students cannot read at grade-level by 3rd grade, it has devastating consequences for the entirety of their education. FIS believes that focusing on communities with the largest concentration of students who scored in the lowest 25% on the California Standards Test (or new Smarter Balance tests), will yield the greatest improvements to overall grade-level reading in LA County. FIS has chosen to serve these students because we believe it is in these communities that our services can make a measurable difference.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "In addition to support from the national Campaign for Grade-Level Reading network, FIS is fortunate to have a number of thought partners and key sponsors in this critical endeavor:",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "District-wide graduation rates",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "As noted previously, 3rd grade reading proficiency is strongly correlated with high school graduation. By offering programs that prepare more 3rd graders to meet grade-level reading standards, the GLR campaign will directly impact each of the metrics selected above. In addition, we believe that the project will have an indirect impact on many of the other metrics (e.g., youth unemployment and underemployment, college matriculation rates, truancy rates). By ensuring that more children are on track with their reading and instilling a love of learning through out of school activities, we are preparing them to be successful students throughout their academic careers, positioning them not only to complete high school but to succeed in college as well.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Commitment from Schools: FIS partners with schools to execute the MWC and PTS summer learning campaigns. FIS’s ability to galvanize parents around issues important to their child’s academic success is dependent on access to parents through their children’s schools. Our strategy for ensuring successful implementation is to include LAUSD on our Steering Committee, demonstrating to the individual schools that the program is a district-supported initiative.",

    "goal": "CONNECT",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The project will be implemented in and for the residents of Long Beach and the surrounding cities, but given WSLB’s efforts – already underway – to utilize social media as part of the agency’s DV/TDV prevention strategy, the project’s reach will potentially be much broader geographically. Because the project’s focus is on TDV/DV and the development of leadership skills vis-à-vis community mobilization, the primary audience will be youth, ages 11-18 and adults of all ages. The very nature of community mobilization is to reach and inspire all, so while the primary audience appears to be related to domestic violence, the project should be viewed as having no audience limitations.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By having a front-line, established collaborative equipped with the specific knowledge and skills necessary to provide SNAC, WSLB has the capacity to provide the public with an atmosphere of trust, safety and communication to expedite positive change and facilitate a safer community. In a very impactful and strategic way, this project will help to establish the ongoing infrastructure needed to take WSLB and its collaborators (existing and new) to a new level of community engagement.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "WSLB will evaluate the project and measure success against realizing the following goals: (1) delivering 10 Train the Trainer sessions; (2) recruiting and training 10 youth leaders and 5 adult leaders through a series of community events and presentations; (3) active participation on five community task forces and coalitions; (4) developing and disseminating cybersafety and other written material that reaches tens of thousands of Long Beach residents; (5) furthering community awareness and dialogue concerning the issues of TDV and DV through three major community events which will reach hundreds, if not thousands, of community members.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Having now served the Greater Long Beach community for more than 36 years, WSLB’s programs and services are well-established and have withstood the tests of time. Unlike sister agencies that have had to reduce services (and in some cases, close their doors) following the onset of the 2008 recession, WSLB has maintained its programming and continued to plan for future growth. Per the agency’s strategic plan, WSLB is committed to bolstering all prevention activities. The Youth Services program staff already have taken steps toward implementing strong and far-reaching prevention activities, and so, are primed to realize the objectives of the proposed project. Furthermore, our collaborators stand ready to participate fully in this endeavor.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "We recognize that primary prevention is the key to addressing the public health crisis of domestic violence. While our mission statement – to eliminate domestic violence through compassionate intervention, education, and personal empowerment – does not include the word prevention, that concept is the very reason we include “education” as part of our work.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Safe Networks/Active Communities promotes awareness of and prevention of domestic violence in the community and in cyberspace.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "WSLB’s serves Long Beach and surrounding cities in LA County.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Safe Networks/Active Communities (SNAC) project is designed both to protect teen dating violence and domestic violence survivors in the community from threats in cyberspace and to promote awareness and prevention of domestic violence through social media, marketing and community mobilization.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Start-up activities call for the design/piloting of the project's cybersafety curriculum and the continued enhancement of WSLB's online presence. After the curriculum has been evaluated to ensure all issues are addressed and that our methodology is responsive to both the unique learning styles of older teens and adults, the agency will offer “train the trainer “classes to other area shelters and agencies that serve youth and young adults.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Funded, SNAC will inform future dialogue on teen dating violence and domestic violence. Collaborators, already aware of the need to address intimate partner violence, will appreciate the knowledge we are guaranteed to gain as we develop and implement this special project. Youth and domestic violence agencies will benefit from the increasingly substantive leadership in the area of community education.",

    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "WSLB’s current DV/TDV primary prevention efforts maximize local resources and assets in service to youth. Guiding past and current prevention work has been WSLB’s substantive collaboration with the school district, whose representatives have helped to coordinate the delivery of TDV presentations by WSLB’s Youth Services staff. Since 2006, these presentations at middle and high schools have delivered knowledge on TDV while simultaneously introducing local youth to WSLB’s position as an advocate. Post-presentation activities, in turn, have provided WSLB staff with an opportunity to assess the needs of local youth and then bring those assessments to planning sessions with other service providers within the community’s continuum of care.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Many people do not prepare healthy meals at home because they believe it is expensive and time-consuming. Brown Paper LA wants to show low-income and working families that neither is the case. Making healthy food at home is easier and cheaper than they expect.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We anticipate that Brown Paper could integrate as an add-on feature to a wide range of events and community services. This project would only be as successful as the partnerships we create.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Within 2-3 months, we would be able to purchase and retrofit a vehicle that would suit the needs of this project: giving Brown Paper the ability to host the classes and cooking demonstrations discussed.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The regulatory framework surrounding food preparation can be tricky. Because we have been a licensed caterer for a number of years, we are confident we can manage this regulatory environment. Further, because the food would not be for sale, this would mitigate some of the regulations that most food trucks have to overcome.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "First, we would retrofit a food truck in consultation with cooking instructors. This requires not only a functional kitchen but also small groups of people to participate in cooking and larger groups to view the process at work.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "We cater intimate events using fresh ingredients and simple recipes.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Access to healthy food",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Low-income and working families face a number of food insecurity issues, including obesity due to poor nutrition and lack of access to healthy foods in food deserts. Brown Paper wants to encourage these families to make healthier choices and show that cooking healthy meals does not have to be an expensive nor time-consuming process.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Eating healthy can be daunting -- unless you know how to prepare the food.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will take into account the following factors to evaluate our project: the number of people who attend our demonstrations, the number of invitations we receive to attend additional events, the reception we receive when we reach out to participate in outside events, and the feedback we receive from hosts and event organizers. If we find that the number of attendees and the number of invitations increase, this would validate that the wider community finds us to be a valuable partner.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Chris Register, the founder of Brown Paper Los Angeles, previously founded the Tin Box of Curious Artifacts, a mobile van that sold vintage goods and clothing. Through this process, he learned that nontraditional mobile vendors often complement existing vendors and options at live events. For example, at food truck events, Tin Box was often a welcome addition, because it would draw additional attendees to these events and provided another way to build community among attendees at large.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Proposed collaboration (we want to work with partners!)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "These cooking classes will benefit low-income and working families who may believe that they do not have the time nor the skills to cook healthy meals for their families."

    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "MacArthur Park represents a prime opportunity for connecting and engaging Angelenos, and investment in the park and its promise is on the rise. Today, more community-based organizations, elected officials, and activist networks are turning their attention to this neglected historic landmark. In 2014, we forged meaningful relationships with other organizations and agencies and we intend to continue working collectively to enact change in this area of Los Angeles. We work closely with the City Department of Recreation and Parks to ensure our work supports the Park Director and his efforts to bring programs to MacArthur Park. Other key partners include Praise Chapel Los Angeles, Heart of Los Angeles, Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, Esperanza Housing Corporation, Rediscover MacArthur Park Alliance and two neighborhood councils. The collaborative energy and transformative spirit persists, and we need to capitalize on this moment. We believe our project can serve as a catalyst to unite various efforts and turn MacArthur Park into a real resource that spurs local and city-wide opportunities for connection.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The current public perception of MacArthur Park safety and cleanliness is a challenge that greatly impacts this project to revive the park. Additionally, there is a mistrust of the public process on the part of the local community due to failed attempts by other organizations in the past. However, the Land Trust has been working in underserved communities that struggle with similar issues for over 12 years. Our strategy to engage communities and cultivate leaders is a proven model for success. Our commitment to building partnerships with various government agencies, local nonprofits, and community groups serve as the cornerstone of successful implementation of the project, despite these challenges.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Informed by our 2014 research, we will revive MacArthur Park through outreach, leadership development, events and programming, beautification, and social media messaging.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Whoever said Angelenos don’t walk has never visited South Alvarado Street. Every day, this thoroughfare is busy with people on foot passing through, or on the way to the nearby metro stop. Today, pedestrians hurry past MacArthur Park without a second glance toward the lake, the soccer field, or the historic recreation center. We envision reviving the park through programming, events, leadership development and social media branding, so that MacArthur Park is no longer an ignored backdrop and instead, becomes a destination for connecting with nature, connecting with one another, and connecting with history. Local residents will be more aware of park programs where they can interact with their neighbors and build support networks. Local youth will no longer seek out programming at other, farther parks, but will instead attend movie-nights at MacArthur Park and connect to the community resources available at the rec center. We also expect the free wifi (to be installed in 2014) to draw people out of their houses and into the park to stay connected with current events, local news, or social media friends. This is all possible, and we can make it happen together.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Our organization has been working to improve low-income communities through the creation of urban parks and gardens for the past 12 years, with 15 completed projects. In that time, we have learned that community involvement is the key to transforming neighborhoods. Our experience has also taught us the importance of having engaged stakeholders at various levels. For this reason, our project at MacArthur Park will be driven by community residents, in partnership with local organizations, with support from elected officials.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will evaluate our project based on attendance at cultural and volunteer events and via community feedback on our process for reviving MacArthur Park.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have spent this year laying a valuable foundation for this project. We built our base of residents, joined networks of local organizations, forged strategic partnerships, and tested our ability to engage community members through cultural events. We conducted research to ensure our short-term and long-term strategies for reviving MacArthur Park are supported by the community and we worked with elected officials to align our project with their goals for the area. We have a solid strategy and the tools in place to take MacArthur Park to the next level over the coming year.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "In 2015, we will work to revitalize MacArthur Park into a vibrant hub for community connection.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The LA Neighborhood Land Trust is working to revitalize MacArthur Park as a thriving community hub that connects Angelenos. This year, we engaged over 1,000 residents, with over 600 community members participating in our park beautification days. We conducted community research through surveys, focus groups, interviews, and mapping exercises, and are documenting resident concerns in a report with recommendations for the improvement of the park. In 2015, we will continue our collaborative efforts to revive the park into a vibrant community space for connection in the center of LA. We’ve heard what community members have to say, and now we’re putting it into action!",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This community-driven project will first and foremost directly benefit the residents of Westlake, an underserved neighborhood in central Los Angeles, who currently suffer from a lack of green space, resources, social capital, support networks, and connection to decision-makers and each other.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "We have a proven track record of success turning out residents to volunteer in MacArthur Park on various projects and beautification efforts over the past year, culminating in over 550 people attending our Keep It Clean event in June 2014, and these numbers are on their way up. Residents are eager for change and willing to take on the challenge. By bringing educational and health programs to the park, as well as opportunities for connecting with neighbors, our project will provide emotional and social support for adults. We host cultural events and have high attendance due to the extensive outreach we conduct. Our leadership development work will encourage residents to participate in the civic process and attend neighborhood council meetings to be involved in local decision-making. Meanwhile, our community research from 2014 will result in a report with community recommendations that legitimize resident requests and improve our ability to advocate for resources, improving government responsiveness to residents’ needs.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "This project is intended to acquaint traditionally underserved youth with the possibility of a career in the L.A. area entertainment industry. We will do this in two different ways. First, we will offer a program in which the students are taught about the various work roles that exist both on the set and behind the scenes, everything from the lighting technician to the studio accountant. Secondly, we will continue and expand on our programs in which we help students to develop their own creativity through storytelling, following which they apply the stories they have developed to script writing and then to the process of turning a script into an actual film. Students will get the chance to study under well known industry professionals.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By introducing avenues of entry to the entertainment industry to traditionally underserved youth, we hope to see an increase in their numbers in radio, television, and film, both in front of the camera and behind the scene. Some of this will come sooner, but the ultimate aim is to make this project into a long term process, and for some of our graduates to make lifelong careers in the industry.",

    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We will teach youth from all over the Los Angeles area about the business of the entertainment industry, including workshops introducing all of the various jobs both on the set, on location, and behind the scenes. We will also continue our intensive workshops on story telling, radio producing, and film production, but extended to youth from all over the L.A. area.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The most direct beneficiaries of the program are the students themselves, but we hope that in addition, the local economy will ultimately benefit as well. One effect of bringing students to culture is to stimulate them to become consumers of culture. The fallout of this is to benefit museums, the live theater, and serious films. We are also hopeful that the local entertainment industry will benefit by finding a pool of talented professionals who come from traditionally underserved and minority communities. The ultimate effect is on those communities themselves, as they have suffered high levels of unemployment historically. Of course we also expect that the local community will benefit immediately from the creative works made by the students which will be presented in public showings. The ultimate beneficiary of an industry that remains robust and authentically local over the next 4 decades is our entire economy.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The fact that a video has been shot does not mean that the film is complete and ready for presentation. Although our programs have traditionally concentrated on the sequence that begins with developing a story and continues through the acting and the videography, we have not generally taken the students through an exhaustive course in film editing. We understand full well that this is an important part of the whole project, and we recognize that we will need to add some training in computerized editing. We have made provisions in this application for the minimal required level of equipment, and we have able instructors who can bring the students along to an adequate level of skill at the beginner level. We should point out that there are lots of jobs in the entertainment industry which do not require film editing skills. Nevertheless, we feel that this is a skill and an art that is at least worthy of mention and of a modest level of training.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We have a history of collaboration with the Boys and Girls Club of San Pedro, which has joined us in our Youth Intensive Filmmaking Workshops. We work with entertainment industry professionals who enjoy teaching and coaching. We have concentrated on accentuating the story telling aspect of the creative endeavor, which is new to these students. We intend to extend our collaboration to youth organizations and schools from other, traditionally underserved areas of the city. The LA2050 grant will allow us to extend training to these students, and will provide a modest amount of seed money which we will use to develop a permanent presence.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The proposed project can be completed in 12 months as specified. We have merely to continue what we have already been doing in terms of education and training, but to increase the numbers of workshops and to add one new topic. We have been wanting to do this, and the grant would make it possible. We don’t expect to stop what we are doing after the year is over, either. Rather, we intend to use the next year as the stepping stone to a robust, institutionalized process which will continue for years to come. As we point out elsewhere in this application, we don’t intend to use the grant funds to do our own fundraising, but developing the expanded program will benefit the community in a way that cannot but help us to be recognized by the more traditional donors.",

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The first lesson is very positive. We have had remarkably generous cooperation from local organizations and attractions, including the Battleship Iowa organization and the LA Maritime Institute. We have developed a very good relationship with the Boys and Girls Club of San Pedro. Finally, we have been extremely fortunate to have volunteers from the entertainment industry, who not only have taught in our workshops, they have pushed us to continue the tradition. In short, we find that there is no shortage of gifted people and volunteers who have proved themselves to be able mentors of our students."

But there are unexpected neighborhood heroes that disrupt the deadly cycle of violence: former gang members who have had enough. When there’s a 3 am shooting, a gang interventionist is there to comfort the survivors, control rumors, stop retaliation, broker peace, and connect families to much-needed services. Advancement Project’s Urban Peace Academy partners with them to effectively disrupt violence through a rigorous training program. The Academy also trains other frontline people in hot zones, such as social workers, hospital staffers, and therapists – all necessary to change the future of gang-involved youth and their families.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Advancement Project has confirmed its partnership with V2K HELPER Foundation to implement the Urban Peace Academy for the My LA 2050 Grants Challenge. V2K HELPER Foundation brings the added benefit of extensive knowledge and experience in engaging families of gang-involved youth in high-violence communities. Founded in 1999, V2K HELPER Foundation (formerly known as Venice 2000) is a nonprofit organization originally established to provide gang intervention and prevention services. Since that time, the organization has come to view “community-intervention” services as a critical need to combat gang-related violence, the destruction of our communities, and the loss of our young people to the lure of the underground economy. The goal of V2K HELPER Foundation is to provide the resources and guidance to help struggling youth and community members of all ages make the transition from negative, anti-social behavior to positive, value-centered alternatives.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Advancement Project initially created the Urban Peace Academy due to Los Angeles’ failed and costly “war on gangs”. The City of Los Angeles spent 30 years and $25 billion that resulted in 450,000 youth arrests; six times as many gangs; increasing gang violence; gang participation that had mushroomed to more than 100,000 active members; and persistent conflict between law enforcement and communities of color. We learned this and more in researching our groundbreaking 2007 report, “A Call to Action: A Case for a Comprehensive Solution to L.A.’s Gang Violence Epidemic” based on exhaustive research by 45 subject matter experts, including police. We saw this massive failure as a warning that we needed a completely new strategy.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "We anticipate our project may encounter the following challenges:",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Advancement Project’s Urban Peace Academy will train at least 60 gang interventionists in cutting-edge violence disruption. There will be seven training sessions over 12 months: two 12-week training sessions for entry-level gang interventionists; and five one-day intensive workshops provided with our partner gang intervention organization, V2K HELPER Foundation, for at least 250 professionals who want to build skills in engaging gang-involved youth and families.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 PLAY metrics?": "Access to open space and park facilities",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Disrupt Violence trains former gang members to disrupt the deadly cycle of gang violence, creating family and neighborhood safety in L.A.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "The greenest park, newest playground, or highest-quality program can’t make a difference in the lives of Angelenos unless they feel safe enough to use them. Gang interventionists work in “hot zones” - communities with particularly high levels of gang violence, especially as compared to surrounding neighborhoods. In a hot zone, even walking to school is a battle. As one youth in Watts described in a focus group we conducted: “It’s not even about learning anymore. It’s about survival. Just get there and get back home.”",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Urban Peace Academy will benefit the communities most impacted by violence throughout Los Angeles County, as many interventionists grew up and hold a License to Operate in these places. In a hot zone community, even walking to school is a battle. In our research report, “Community Safety Scorecard: Los Angeles”, published in 2011, the least safe ZIP codes in the city generally experienced two times the gang related crime as the city as a whole, and almost twice the rate of violent crime and child abuse.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Advancement Project evaluates the success of the Urban Peace Academy at the level of the individual participant and at the neighborhood level of the community they serve and work to keep safe. Because gang interventionists we train are generally part of larger efforts in LA County to reduce violence, we examine select city-wide and county-wide crime data.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Advancement Project has extensive experience implementing the Urban Peace Academy, and in partnership with V2K HELPER Foundation, can provide the necessary capacity to deliver the project over the next twelve months. We have conducted the entry-level gang intervention training each year for more than five years; and our new comprehensive training for community intervention workers has dedicated instructors and a curriculum that has been vetted by our partners in gang intervention, mental health, law enforcement, and academia. Advancement Project’s offices in Echo Park feature a conference room that can accommodate the training sessions. To date, the Urban Peace Academy has trained over 2,400 gang intervention and community workers, as well as over 600 law enforcement officers, through a parallel training we developed for police that allows for cross-training opportunities and development of best practices for collaboration between these stakeholders."

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "SCI-Arc, one of the top architecture schools in the US, and Habitat for Humanity, Greater Los Angeles are launching the SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Housing Project. The initiative is an exciting opportunity to innovatively redevelop neglected properties in LA and positively impact the communities they exist within. The collaboration will include a series of SCI-Arc classes in which students creatively design affordable and sustainable housing to be built on land transferred to Habitat by LA County. The project champions the idea that beyond the crucial role of providing shelter, a well-designed home, both inside and in context to its urban fabric, can help improve the lives and well-being of its residents, as well as the community beyond its walls.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "While SCI-Arc and Habitat for Humanity, Greater Los Angeles will obviously measure success with the construction of the first SCI-Arc/Habitat LA home, many factors will play a part in how this success is measured throughout the project and beyond.",

The fall semester (Sept-Dec) of SCI-Arc’s academic schedule will be devoted to the student design of a home, the spring semester (Jan-April) will complete final documentation of the project, and during the summer semester (May-Aug) SCI-Arc students will join Habitat LA’s volunteers in order to acquire firsthand building experience during the construction phase of the project. During this time, students may also use facilities at SCI-Arc to build components of the home at the school to then attach to the building on site.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Understanding that where one lives contributes greatly to one’s physical and emotional well-being, this project will help make LA the healthiest place to live by helping low-income residents access mindful, creative, and environmentally sustainable design within their own homes and communities. Just as Habitat believes that everyone deserves a decent and affordable place to live, SCI-Arc believes that everyone equally deserves that place to be the best design and quality it can be.",

Being able to partner with such a well-respected affordable housing organization allows the initiative to have an immediate impact on families and individuals in LA. Because, however, the partnership will ensure that creative design, innovation, and sustainability are at the forefront of the affordable housing model, this project will also impact the LA2050 ‘LIVE’ metrics through an added metric of how an environment’s design can impact how we live.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementing the first SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Housing Project within the next twelve month is not only an achievable goal, but is also within the existing timeframe both partners are currently working with. As mentioned, starting in September 2014, SCI-Arc and Habitat LA will begin a series of design-build studios whose structure is set up to complete one SCI-Arc/Habitat home per academic year. With the agreed upon ‘Fall: Design, Spring: Document, Summer: Build’ timeline, the first iteration of the SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Project will be complete at the end of the summer in 2015. Taking advantage of the strengths of both partners, the design studios will be a chance for students to both design and document the home within two academic semesters. Following this, the home will begin construction under Habitat’s organized building schedule, whereby Habitat LA acts as general contractor and is supported by their existing framework of volunteers.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The first challenge SCI-Arc anticipates will be aligning each individual organization’s timeline so that each phase can fall within the academic calendar structure of the initiative. As with any partnership, SCI-Arc and Habitat for Humanity, Greater Los Angeles will need to remain in close collaboration to ensure the project stays on course towards a 2015 summer build for the students."

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "At Crossroads, we look at many variables to measure success. Our main outcome is whether a woman completes the six-month program (and does not return to prison). We also measure success by monitoring specific benchmarks which include: length of time in our program, completion of program, discharge from parole, obtainment of employment, length of time maintaining employment, and lifestyle changes (new friends, interests, sobriety). We pay close attention to other milestones which include a woman re-uniting with her family or continuing her education.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "It is a myth that long-term incarceration means that it will be impossible to find a job. It is far more important that job seekers have relevant work experience. Our program debunks this myth and enables women to gain valuable work experience that will help them secure employment. Garden programs in prison have been shown to be effective, but the women need to feel a sense of ownership and see the fruits of their labor. In prison, women couldn’t eat the vegetables they grew.

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "A city’s youth are key allies in building a strong future. Third Century Greek philosopher Diogenes was one of the first to say this, and may have said it best when he said, “[t]he foundation of every state is the education of its youth.” This ancient and enduring truth motivates CRF’s work today. Modern research confirms that civic learning in school is critical to students’ becoming prepared and willing to contribute meaningfully to community and political life. Youth who participate in civic learning today gain the skills and experience to become leaders who will ensure that LA2050 is the most civically engaged region in the U.S. While our project takes an educational approach, our ultimate aim is a citywide increase in social connectedness across LA. We equip high schoolers near graduation with confidence, leadership skills and knowledge so that they are prepared to lead ripple-effect increases in civic engagement and positive change in their communities throughout LA. By teaching high school students skills for civic engagement, we give them the tools to actively build a stronger LA both now, and in the future.",

Numerous studies, including the 2005 study we refer to in response to the prompt above (regarding how our proposal will make LA the best place to connect today and in 2050), have shown that this kind of curricular content has a demonstrable positive effect on students’ future behaviors and outlooks on civic engagement. Based on this research, we can confidently state that implementing CAP in 50 additional classrooms in the LA area will lead to increased volunteering, increased participation at public meetings and on neighborhood councils, as well as increased voter turnout despite statistical predictions based on race.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "In the long-term our project will impact the LA2050 “CONNECT” metrics listed above. In the short-term, we will measure our success according to the following metrics:",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "We imagine a vibrant LA2050 where strong social connectedness joins citizens who work together to solve problems and improve communities. The LA2050 we envision is a place where civic engagement, voter participation and social trust are high because people understand the power of their voice and claim their right to be heard in our democracy. Research shows that education is one of strongest ways to overcome low levels of social trust and stimulate civic engagement. Thus, our idea for increasing social connectedness in LA2050 is to equip tomorrow’s voters with the skills and knowledge to lead positive change in their communities by expanding our Civic Action Project (CAP) into 50 additional high school classrooms in LA over the next year.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. From our long institutional experience providing curricular resources to support Social Studies teachers, we have learned that engaging students in real-world problem solving, not just telling them how important it is to be civically involved, is critical to these students’ developing the skills to contribute meaningfully to civic processes, both in the short-term, and in the future as adult citizens. The CAP program lets students pursue this kind of problem solving and to learn experientially how local government works as they address a real-world issue. We have learned that in the context of the opportunity to take real action, students are eager to dive into the content of a civics/ government course, material that is stereotypically thought of as a snooze-fest. We hope to offer the CAP experience to as many LA students as we can to ensure that as many current and future Angelenos as possible may benefit from the real changes and improvements CAP participants achieve for their communities. Our experience has also taught us that it is important to convince teachers to let their students start on their CAP projects early in the course so that students have the time to actually make a difference.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1)\tScheduling. Teachers are busy, and even the time commitment required to attend an after school CAP implementation training may be a barrier to some teachers’ choosing to implement CAP. We have found that offering $50.00 stipends to help teachers cover additional expenses (such as childcare, transportation, etc.) they may incur related to attending a CAP training helps increase attendance at training sessions and implementation of CAP. Additionally, to minimize schedule conflicts, we will poll teachers for their preferred training times, and coordinate our planned training sessions with LAUSD calendars.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Civic education today is an essential part of ensuring that the citizens of LA2050 are prepared and willing to engage in public life. Schools have a critical role to play in ensuring that every LA resident gets the type of civic learning opportunities that will empower him or her with the lifelong skills to contribute meaningfully to civic processes. Research backs up the positive impact that curriculum emphasizing civic engagement has on students’ attitudes about participating in democracy such as their level of political interest, and the strength of their intention to vote. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between exposure to civic education and attendance at a four-year college. The LA2050 Report notes that this positive cycle comes full circle as higher educational attainment is, in turn, linked to greater social connectedness. Conversely, students who do not get opportunities for civic learning in school are unlikely to come across such opportunities elsewhere. They are disproportionately less likely to vote or engage in public life in other ways.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The LA2050 Report is clear that LA’s low “connectedness indicators are perhaps the most concrete (and disheartening) manifestation of LA’s inadequate education system.” By providing teachers with free, standards-aligned resources to facilitate better social studies education, CAP strikes at one of the root causes of low connectedness in LA. By giving students the opportunity to see the impact their volunteer work can have, CAP instils prosocial values like volunteerism, caring, and community involvement – values these students will carry into our future LA. This dual approach makes CAP a strong partner for LA2050’s strategy of raising LA2050’s connectedness indicators through improved educational outcomes that will generate greater civic engagement and social trust. Connectedness, the LA2050 Report notes, is fundamental to the human experience. Thus, by improving connectedness, implementing CAP on a broader scale stands to benefit all Angelenos, now and in 2050."

In 2050?": "Los Angeles is our city, and Silver Lake is our neighborhood -- today we want to strengthen our relationship with the place we live by celebrating our local queer history and empowering our residents to continue to make history.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "QueerFest will directly benefit Silver Lake residents, whose relationship with their neighborhood will deepen through participation in our unique programming. That said, individuals from all over Los Angeles (and beyond) will be welcome to attend QueerFest’s events, and learn about our colorful history and culture.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We are proud to say that QueerFest is a confirmed project of the Pasadena Arts Alliance’s EMERGE Program, and that PAC will serve as our project’s 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor. PAC serves as fiscal sponsor for install:WEHO, Native Strategies, Fallen Fruit, and KCHUNG in Chinatown. All donations to PAC specified for QueerFest will be tax deductible, and the staff of the Pasadena Arts Alliance has shared their extensive knowledge on how to run a successful festival and fundraise for a large scale arts project.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 PLAY metrics?": "Access to open space and park facilities",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will measure success by participation. We hope to have most, if not all, of the businesses within our QueerFest zone contribute to our festival in some way. We will gather reports from the businesses to evaluate if there are upward trends in sales during QueerFest. We will also measure success by how many volunteers come forward to help power this event.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We've spent the last six months engaging local businesses, artists, and garnering support for this festival. We've gotten venues and spaces donated. We've presented to the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council. We've met with and gotten support from our District's Councilman and the Board of Public Works. We've built the infrastructure (logistics, operations) and sourced production quotes.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Queerfest is a weeklong festival in Silver Lake businesses and streets, celebrating the past and present of the local queer community.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The first annual QueerFest focuses on a historic area of Los Angeles once known for its dense saturation of LGBT businesses and culture. Many formerly queer venues in the neighborhood will play host to installations, screenings, and events throughout the week leading up to the Fest -- and in some cases, become their former incarnations for a night. A veteran of Silver Lake will lead walking tours of historic LGBT landmarks in the neighborhood, and give insight into their significance to our community today. The week will culminate in a street closure on Sunday with a diverse outdoor program featuring live music and art performances, local queer artists and vendors, and a park installation / gathering place for the community.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Because this will be our inaugural year, it has been paramount to QueerFest to engage the participation and interest of the Silver Lake community. Local businesses and neighborhood councils within our zone have given their full-hearted support for our free, inclusive festival. City officials will speak at events during the weekend, and the last living protester from the 1967 Black Cat Riots will give a keynote address. We want members of our community to learn about their history, connect with each other, and play in open spaces while forging a deeper love for their neighborhood.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "After attending a neighborhood council meeting, we learned the importance of keeping our festival free. For-pay festivals have their place, but Silver Lake residents have too often felt alienated by required entry fees. We listened to the community we’re trying to serve, so our festival will be inclusive and free of charge.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "QueerFest, by educating festival goers on the queer experience, will breed tolerance for the LGBTQA community both local and at large. LGBTQA residents will feel safer in their neighborhood knowing that they’re not only understood by their neighbors, but that there’s a place for them in Silver Lake.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One major challenge we have anticipated is not raising the sufficient funds for this festival. In this case, our strategy is to prepare a downsized festival manageable by volunteers and artists, and capitalizing on the space and venue donations made by local businesses. We want the first year of QueerFest to feel like a \"hit,\" rather than spread too thin."

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "The groups of people we serve are amongst the most medically complex individuals in the county. By better serving their needs, we can help the healthcare safety net better deal with the impacts via reduced hospitalizations, visits to ER's and better management and prevention of chronic health conditions that can be reduced via on-going, culturally competent and timely care. The impacts go beyond the thousands of clients we serve, to their families and other care-givers which often neglect their own health even as they care for our patients.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The primary challenges are that this process may be laying the groundwork for eventual change that may take more than 12 months. Change at the Federal level is incremental. In addition, we are not aware of the process other groups have utilized to effect similar changes for special populations that have received special support like homeless clients and those in agricultural regions that have migrant workers. That being said, raising awareness even at the initial stages of this project may allow us to get some of the technical assistance and support that the Federal government provides to other special population designees.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "We are learning that the federal healthcare system is very much oriented towards a volume and efficiency level that makes it hard to take into account the complex healthcare and support needs of people with developmental disabilities. In order to build sustainable safety net supports for these individuals, it will be necessary to build in more flexibility into the compliance requirements as well as more support options that can take into account the different business models that have to evolve to accommodate the unique needs of our patients. We also realize that in order for other parts of the community to pursue this access to healthcare gap for clients with developmental disabilities it is vital to have viable demonstration pilots to learn from and Achievable can be one of those such blueprints with your support.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Although based in Culver City, we serve families across LA County.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Achievable Clinic is a state-licensed Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) specializing in providing appropriate, coordinated, continuous, high-quality and comprehensive healthcare services to our under-served community members, with a special focus on serving individuals with developmental disabilities and their families who lack access to such care in the broader community.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The Achievable Clinic is leveraging our strategic partnerships with organizations like the Westside Regional Center (WRC)--where we are co-located-- to offer a growing spectrum of health care services to the expanding number of individuals with developmental disabilities who have MediCal insurance coverage through L.A. Care Health Plan. Based on the latest information from L.A. Care, there are over 2,286 clients at WRC (or roughly one third of all WRC clients) signed up with one of L.A. Care’s health plan providers.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "We will improve access to healthcare by being able to serve thousands of clients via our FQHC clinic with enhanced Special Population status allowing for possibly more funding and technical assistance as we implement our clinical care model.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Achievable Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1996 with the mission of significantly improving the health and quality of life of under-served individuals living in Los Angeles County who have developmental disabilities such as autism, intellectual disability, cerebral palsy and epilepsy.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Healthcare access",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Achievable deliverables would include both a planning document that will be shared with our Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA) liaison and other leaders, as well as the establishment of a meeting subsequent to delivery of our alignment document to determine next steps and action plans to effect changes to the current model that apply to clinics like the Achievable Clinic. In addition, evaluation of the success of the project would include the formulation of a long-term plan for obtaining Special Population designation for the Achievable FQHC. This should translate into enhanced technical assistance, potential new funding support, and waivers that may allow us to meet compliance requirements without compromising our client needs or undermining long-term fiscal sustainability.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "FQHCs that focus on special populations such as residents of public housing, persons experiencing homelessness or agricultural workers, are subject to special waivers and accommodations that allow the FQHCs to address the unique health care needs of these groups. No such process currently exists for people with developmental disabilities.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Twelve months will allow us to begin the research and initial interaction stages of implementation, including scheduling meetings with the appropriate federal authorities. That being said, we are aware that this is the beginning of long-term investment in effecting truly wide-ranging change that could impact how possibly millions of americans get access to healthcare. The system does not take into account the unique needs of people with developmental disabilities, and our hope that this process will begin changing how the healthcare network works for this growing part of our community.",

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The main challenge will be to continue increasing our budget, so that when this grant is finished, we can sustain this new level of spending. We are confident we can, as we have increased our income by more than this each year, & because these activities will themselves help create new revenues (our tabloid will be more attractive to sponsors, the radio show may attract underwriting), but in any case it will require continued diligence.",

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "One of the most difficult tasks we have faced in building LARB over these last three years is educating people about the need to support work like LARB’s. People understand that to be part of a community that has decent radio, we need to support our public radio stations, that if we want symphony orchestras and opera companies and art museums, we need to help support them. But people are less aware that in order to have quality publications like ours, publications devoted to the common good and lifelong education and cultural conversation, they need to support them as well. The old systems that supported literary life—print advertising and subscriptions and author advances—are, as we know, getting squeezed or disappearing, and LARB started by watching the alarming disappearance of serious book reviews in the newspaper world.",

We're hoping to do the same thing for air quality and other environmental data so right now Angelenos can get very vague data - air in LA is OK today, air in LA is bad today - etc. Our sensors and network will change that and tell people exactly what is different street to street, moment to moment. Imagine being able to plan a run or bike ride specifically down streets with better air quality at the least polluted times of the day. Imagine being able to pinpoint pollution sources and make changes to correct these problems at the source.",

This is a game that today, at this very moment, thrives on its connectivity and shared purpose in achieving a single goal. Every year we receive 150 applications to participate in our computer programming classes. Every year we reject 130 kids. LA2050 can help us serve over 400 students. Not one kid who tell us that they want to learn to code or design will be left behind. In the last two years we have interviewed over 300 kids and they all have said that they want to create by learning to code. Our alumni have confirmed that one of the best way to reach more students is to use Minecraft. Minecraft is being used world wide and is time that Los Angeles uses it to create and nurture the future innovators of our city.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Our idea will make LA the best place to create today, because we are engaging young innovators who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and have great ideas, to make their communities a better place. These young innovators want to start creating and sharing their ideas today. The over 150 students we have interviewed in the past year are ready to be part of an LA that encourages them to create and design new environments, and where they will learn the skills of the 21st century.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementing this project within the next 12 months is an achievable goal for UrbanTxt, partly because we already have a number of strategic partnerships with schools and youth organizations in place that will allow us access to some of the brightest and most highly motivated students in Los Angeles. Our current partnerships include linkages with middle and high schools and the following orgs in Los Angeles: Alliance Charter Schools, Boys and Girls Club, ICEF Charter Schools, Manual Arts, Brotherhood Crusades, YMCA, ELACC, YesWeCode, Riordan Foundation, California Community Foundation, and the St. Vincent of Paul organization. From the pool of young people that attend and participate in these organizations, in addition to the waiting list of 300 students we have the UrbanTxt program, we will be able to assemble our group of 400 EnisionLA students and tomorrow’s technology entrepreneurs. Our track record of having trained over 300 young men of color how to computer program within the languages of Java, Javascript , html and css, proves that we know how to give young people the training and programming skills they need, and it proves we know how to teach them how to acquire these skills. We are supremely confident that we will be able to implement the VisionLA project within the next 12 months. We have key curriculum which trains trainers; we need to recruit students from list of 300 on our waiting that want to do something like this. Now only do we have the support of local organizations but also national organizations like Google , Yahoo, and YesWeCode. These organizations are ready to help us recruit volunteers and mentors if we need them. They have provided trainers for the past year. Bottom line is that over the past two years kids and orgs from all over Los angeles have asked us to expand, now we are ready to do it. We are ready to do it in a meaningful and unique way. A way that allows teens to connect, play, and learn across city borders. Is time to give all kids in low income community an opportunity to design and code.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One of the challenges that we see in implementing the VisionLA project will be the fact that the neighborhoods and communities that we create within the game will only be accessible through our own network ‘servers’. A server is a computer system, which is used as a repository of data and various programs that are shared by users within a network. Typical computing serves are database servers, mail servers, and gaming servers- all of which house information which people within a network, or organization, can use. If you don’t have access to the server, you won’t be able to access the game. We will need to develop our own server and allow enough bandwith for everyone to join the network.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "#EnvisionLA is a year long interactive, collaborative online project which harnesses the creative potential within the Minecraft video game platform, and asks youth from disadvantaged areas of Watts, East LA, Pico Union, and South LA to re-create their current neighborhood within the game. URBAN TXT will teach kids ages 10-17 to code and design. They will be empower and help us create how the inner city should look like in the year 2050. The Java programming language URBAN TXT teaches, will allows kids to modify the Minecraft world to create their own designs. Participating youth will re-create their neighborhoods as they envision it will exist in the year 2050, using their imagination, acquired skills, and collaborative efforts.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "To implement this project, founder Oscar Menjivar, and our team of over 20 mentor-coders from URBAN TXT, will bring together Black and Latino youth from the areas of South LA, Watts, East LA, and Pico Union to teach them basic and advanced skills in computer programming and design. Much of the initial training will take place within ‘The Cube’, UrbanTxt’s newly renovated ‘Hacker Space’ Headquarters on the outskirts of campus at USC. The students will take these skills, and use them to create simulated scale environments of their own neighborhoods within the Minecraft video game world, as the students envision, and create, what their neighborhoods will look like in the year 2050. Young people will work collaboratively within project management groups, to construct these virtual LA neighborhoods of the future. Many of the youth who participate in our program come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Teens will be learning while playing, having fun, connecting across the city and developing skills that will help create a diverse tech workforce in Los Angeles. Teens who have previously participated in URBAN TXT curriculum will mentor and teach new students how to code, and how to reimagine present day low-income neighborhoods as new communities of the future. #EnvisionLA is an opportunity for young people to create their own utopian worlds, filled with as much hope and opportunity as they wish to fill it. Classes for youth participating in the project will take place at our HackerSpace and at the locations of participating partners. We will train 20 mentors to implement the program and 1 full staff member, and expect it will take four sessions of coding and design classes per week to teach youth the necessary skills. Our equipment needs include computers, a server, and Minecraft related software to complete the project. We expect to complete the #VisonLA virtual world project by",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "As of January 2014, UrbanTxt has trained over 60 kids in four computer programming languages. Our students have created their own apps, and some have even gone on to sell their apps within the Apple App Store. Now we are going to share our knowledge of design and code with ten other organizations around Los Angeles. We already have partner agreements with ICEF and Alliance Charter Schools, and we have discussed the project with Boys and Girls clubs, Brotherhood Crusade, #YesWeCode, Manual Arts HS, Markham Middle School, Arts+ Practice Foundation, YMCA and ELACC. URBAN TxT has a history of collaborating with each of these organizations, and now we want to bring coding to the kids they serve. Every year URBAN TxT receives over 150 applications for our Summer Computer Leadership Academy. Most of our applicant pool comes from our partners, who help us recruit. Currently we are working with over 25 schools all over Los Angeles.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our project is hitting many areas for today and LA2050. As mentioned before there are very few Latinos and Blacks in the creative industry. We hope to inspire more Latinos and Blacks to become owners of tech startups. We know that LA will not survive if we do not trained the disfranchised individuals in low income communities. The more we inspired them to code and design, the more minority owned firms we will see in the future. We must tapped into the assets of low income communities in order for LA to be a vibrant and prosperous town in the year 2050. We cant be a prosperous without those who have less resources, specially resources in tech and design.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "During our #EnvisionLA program, we will evaluate student experiences through pre and post surveys, focus groups, final product presentations review, informal feedback and evaluation assessing change of mindset (e.g. did you think you would be able to learn to code, did you think you could create your own neighborhood using the skills you learned, etc.). As students progress, URBAN TxT leadership and staff are also in contact with graduates through a private internal social media alumni network in which they are able to share their personal and academic successes with other alumni and current program participants."

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Lesson number one: We need risky play in our lives. When people are encouraged to take risks, think outside of the box, explore, create, destroy and team up, they not only create amazing things, but strengthen their own mental and physical well-being and that of the community. Studies show again and again that measured risk when we are young can have multiple short and long-term benefits, and our goal is to encourage this.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Resistance to the Adventure Play concept: This is a barrier of people misunderstanding what a permanent Adventure Playground does. It is common in our culture to be focused on risk management by eliminating risk from any environment children are exposed to. However adventure playgrounds gravitate around the “Risk Benefit” where respect is given to risk taking and allowing players to examine, experiment, and challenge their environment and selves. It is a place with a lot of potential danger; tree climbing, destruction, fire, nails, saws, splinters, other children with fire, nails and saws. But this is not a place for kids to go from “zero to chainsaw”, it is a place where they are able to incrementally gain the skills needed to master these tools. It is actually far riskier to have never encountered a fire and then be expected to know what to do when a fire is blazing in an uncontrolled environment. That said, an Adventure Playground doesn’t have to be all hammers and fire to be and Adventure Playground. All it needs is to meet the play of its visitors and participants. This possible barrier is something that we try to educate the public on at every pop-up event that we do, an outreach that can help calm any panic about what goes on in the play yard. It is also something that will be part of the staff training for Eureka Villa, and encouraging dialogue with those people who have concerns.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have already seen the level of support and love others have shown to us at our pop-up playgrounds and believe this is truly just the beginning. With our existing partnerships, we have a solid foundation to start evolving both the Eureka Villa project and SCV Adventure Play.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We are working within three start-up phases. Phase 1 consists of holding pop-up adventure playgrounds in the Santa Clarita Valley for awareness building of self-directed play, connecting with the community, finding partners who support our mission, marketing our initiative, and to purchase property for a future permanent adventure playground and play education site.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "Both children and adults today suffer from a severe lack of play, access to nature, measured risk, and free space both geographically and mentally. Many studies show how a lack of play can cause obesity, depression, and stunted social skills. Playgrounds and parks today only partially fill these needs, as they are often geared only toward gross motor play(swings, slides, or monkey bars), or structured play (baseball, soccer, etc.) These things are not allowing (young) people to fully explore their environment on their own terms, and at their own speed. Our lives are commonly scheduled from dawn until dusk leaving free time to play absent.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Bi-weekly team meetings: Both our pop-ups and Adventure Playground teams will meet to discuss observations on how to best solve problems and make changes to our sites both temporary and permanent. Discussion, observation, and reflection are essential to connect with each other and the playground participants in a meaningful assessment of their play needs.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Overall, this project will benefit not only kids and adults but specifically kids on the spectrum, senior citizens, disabled children, and those who have limited to no access to nature and wild outdoor space.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Our confirmed collaborators are and have been the Pop-up Adventure Play based in the UK, The ArTree, a local community arts center, The City of Santa Clarita, A Little Patch of Earth Preschool, CalArts Alumni Santa Clarita Chapter, Appliances Unlimited, Newhall Paint, and the Arbor Day Festival. We also have confirmed collaborators from other adventure playgrounds in America and Europe including Rusty Keeler from the Anarchy Zone in Ithaca, NY, Jill Wood, Director of Adventure Playground at The Parish School in Houston, TX, Andy Hinchcliffe from Wyke Community and Childrens Centre in Bradford, United Kingdom and Grant Lambie, founder of Free Play based in London.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "-Access to open space and park facilities - We will be offering our 2 acres of park space to the community, try to bus individuals out to the site, as well as advocating for more in the future.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Proposed collaboration (we want to work with partners!)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "SCV Adventure Play plans to expand its pop-up events and permanent adventure playground to offer our unique play approach to all.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Eureka Villa Project and SCV Adventure Play is comprised of several converging ideas. First, to hold pop-up adventure playgrounds at various community events, schools, group gatherings, etc. to build awareness of and provide an outlet for free play to all. Second, to create a permanent play and gathering space where individuals of all ages can play, learn about playwork and be involved with their community."

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Through the creation of an incubation hub for entrepreneurial artists, Schkapf will create opportunities for both new employment and the creation of new artistic companies within a stimulating and empowering space. Schkapf has a history of cultivating a diverse array of artists and supporting women-led projects, and it intends to continue to do so. (Schkapf won The Most Wanted venue award from Los Angeles Female Playwrights Initiative at the Hollywood Fringe Festival 2014). By improving the university-to-industry pipeline and engaging students, Schkapf will influence the Dream Metrics of improving recruitment and retention at universities, and at nurturing students’ local investment to retain them after graduation. Finally, due to its international ties and commitment to an international face and preparing artists for touring, Schkapf will increase the cultural influence of the performing arts in Los Angeles, typically viewed as a film town, worldwide.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "As an infrastructure project, Schkapf will use the following metrics for evaluation:",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Schkapf has a robust network of sustained partners that it has been collaborating and consulting with to create the first stage of its development. In the performing arts context these include The Clown School (local), the Network of Ensemble Theaters and Celebration Barn (national), Slava Polunin, Au Brana, Awake Projects, the Grotowski Institute and the London School of Performing Arts Practices (international). In a local government context, Schkapf is an active participant in the Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council, Media Business Improvement District, and the Theatre Row Association as well as seeks regular consultation from Arts for LA and the Department of Cultural Affairs. In an academic context, Schkapf has partners at USC, CalArts, CSU/LA (local), Naropa, Emerson and Brown University (national), the Laboratory Theatre Network, the University of Leeds, the University of Huddersfield, and the University of Kent (international), as well as notable independent scholars, such as Kathryn Mederos Syssoyeva and John Britton. We will continue to work extensively with these partners in the visioning and implementation of Stage 2 of this project. Schkapf will also reach out to local theatres that have successfully created multi-faceted neighborhood hubs, such as the Bootleg Theatre (which is also a bar and music venue) and Greenway Arts Alliance (which partners with its local school and vendors) and international organizations such as the National Theatre Studio (a research and development organization that ensures innovative new performance for England’s regional theatres) and the Battersea Arts Centre (a collective of producers who have renovated an historic London Town Hall in order to incubate a variety of performance capable of “inventing the future of theatre”) to further develop our programming and ensure that stage 2 is sustainable and influential. Furthermore, we will identify and begin collaborating with new partners capable of assisting in the creation of an operational and revenue-producing commissary, the foundations for a sustainable touring network, and a university-to-industry pipeline.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Building upon our 10-year track record as a presenting theatre and home to a resident theatre laboratory, Schkapf will expand its pilot programming capacity to increase our functionality as an incubation house for artists as entrepreneurs. In order to achieve this goal, Schkapf will:",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our project benefits the performing arts communities of Los Angeles and their audiences, specifically but not limited to, those interested in physical, visual, ensemble and cross-disciplinary work. It will also benefit the surrounding neighborhood of Schkapf by creating a Cultural Liaison with the intent of bridging the artist-driven work at Schkapf with local residents, creating more dialogue around the use and value of live performance as well as developing mutual bonds that will cultivate respect, care, and pride in the neighborhood itself. Our project also aims to benefit our partner organizations: the local vendor, school, and nonprofit that we engage with in order to mutually grow, or further sustain, our respective organizations.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. The current model of producing live performance in Los Angeles is not viable or sustainable. Performances need to have a long-term investment plan, rather than being subjected to a limited run, have the capacity to grow in size (i.e. from 99-seat to 300-, to 800-seat, etc.), and be flexible to perform in various settings. They need to be created with the intention of touring them, not only to generate a healthy return on investment, but also to enrich the artists involved by exposing their work to diverse audiences, thereby continuing to challenge their own artistic boundaries and responsiveness to current audience demands. Schkapf’s mentorship programs and network affiliations will serve our incubated projects by encouraging such flexibility and responsiveness. However, singular products will not ensure a robust and healthy producing venue. A performing arts centre must exist as a hub. Thus we are implementing multiple programs and space use that ensure a healthy influx of participants and a resilient approach to revenue generation and donor support. This solution arises from the inherent collaborative nature of live performance. Since LA is an urban sprawl, we need to respond by creating a beehive capable of serving multiple artists, who can in turn take their shows on the road and return home with new insight. A collective impact on the ecosystem of LA performance will have much greater influence than a single innovative artist or company making work in a single venue.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have worked with a highly talented team of arts administrators over the past three years on an all-volunteer or small stipend basis, and key individuals are set to begin work full-time pending funding. This year, we ran pilot programs on a shoestring to test and refine all of our projects - incubation, a neighborhood hub with food and drink, educational programming, and academic-practitioner conferences. We are set to apply the lessons learned from these pilot programs and implement them in full. Having run our space for over 10 years, we have extensive experience and relationships ready to be cultivated into meaningful partnerships - all we are missing are the resources to provide sustainable manpower capable of enabling us to build on the strong foundations we have laid over the last decade.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Schkapf recently completed the pilot stage of its LA Performing Arts Incubator, a local space that incubates individual artists as well as ensembles through mentorship, project support, resource sharing and networking. We now need to develop our infrastructure further to better serve as an organizational hub able to bridge artists and resources, art and community, academia and practice. In so doing we will be more appropriately placed to fulfill our mission as a leader in developing quality live performance that raises the industry standard as well as the status of Los Angeles’s performing arts on national and international stages, and to advocate with government officials for a robust pipeline capable of supporting artists's livelihood.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Today, independent artists interested in live performance in Los Angeles contend with the mega-industry that is film and television while receiving minimal support from government and local nonprofits. While many theatres have ‘new works’ series, few incubate projects from inception to completion. University settings are fertile breeding grounds for experimentation, but too often do not communicate with local practitioner groups. The result is a broken pipeline in which much of the city’s best talent does not have a venue to hone their craft, connect with fellow artists, and key into the communities that they exist to serve.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1. The continued rise of commercial rents threaten the viability of an incubation space dedicated to research, gestation, and project implementation. We are therefore committed to a diverse programming that allows for patron generation on multiple levels. We are also collaborating with city and regional officials, university and secondary schools, national and international networks, as well as commercial and philanthropic investors to create an organization dependent upon multiple partners and funding streams.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "PHE LA was founded to address a growing crisis: our teens are navigating difficult decisions and exhibiting risky behaviors on a daily basis, many of which threaten their bodies, well-being, and futures. According to data from the 2013 CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey:",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. We have seen great results from our Cal State Northridge volunteers in terms of \"relatability,\" given the shared demographics in terms of socioeconomic status and race of a majority of our CSUN students to the teens we serve. In volunteer surveys this past year, 85% of CSUN volunteers reported a strong sense of community with their PHE workshop cohort, in contrast to 53% at Occidental and 42% at USC. Out of all 25 PHE colleges across the country, CSUN volunteers reported the strongest “sense of community” with both their campus chapter and their city chapter of PHE, a significant achievement considering CSUN is one of our newest college partners. Given these results, we are seeking to strengthen and expand our work with Cal State volunteers.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "1.\tPHE partners with high schools that lack skills-based health education and in which the majority of the students come from low-income households. These students experience a disproportionate number of serious health risks including unplanned pregnancy, substance abuse, and untreated mental illness. Volunteers teach the PHE curriculum in a required, non-academic class period so that PHE does not interfere with the students’ academic requirements.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "During the 2011-2012 program year, 92% of the PHE Los Angeles high school students qualified as low-income and received free or reduced lunch and 90% were Latino or Black.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "We directly provide instruction on where and how teens can access healthcare resources in their communities, and on understanding the signs of mental illness, addressing the stigma against naming mental illness, and understanding the seriousness of mental health and the impact it can have on a young person, a family and a community. We expect to see more teens accessing mental health services thanks to our program.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have refined our core program model over the past decade nationwide and over the past five years in Los Angeles. We are confident that we can reach at least 2,200 teens in LA County in the 2014-15 school year with a volunteer corps of 250 college students, and have a proven track record of achieving impact through this model.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Healthcare access",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "1.\tPre- and Post-Test (High School Students): A survey administered to PHE high school students before and after the program to assess their knowledge of the health topics we address.

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Ideas for community Peace Projects come from residents through campaigns online and offline. These ideas can range from community gardens to street art murals to innovation hubs. The person with the idea becomes the project leader, partnered with mentors, teachers, students, and resources to empower them to make a physical change in the neighborhood. Project leaders are given training and supported by other students taking World Peace One classes (with UCLA Extension and LATTC) in contributing to projects all over the city. L.A. City 311 and other government services are key partners and classes are offered in WP1 Innovation Hubs and L.A. WorkSource Centers near residents. We partner with local businesses and community groups for outreach.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The first step is empowering people through education. World Peace One helps to connect the as-built environment in our communities with education through community-based projects. Residents who want to transform their environment are supported through mentoring and resources. Students in the education program gain academic credit in a hybrid learning environment by learning as well as journaling, designing, building, sculpting, growing food, coding, creating art, and innovating ideas for these neighborhood projects. In the end, residents and students form the foundation of a larger community that creates these innovative spaces. World Peace One classes are taught through a partnership with UCLA Extension, the Los Angeles City Community District, and iTunes University and range from a Transforming Your Community weekend boot camp for residents with little education to Earth Ethics for Environmental Design for degree-oriented learners.",

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Current practices in peace and community support, while well meaning, often generate solutions first and then impose those solutions onto communities. Many times this process doesn’t close the loop. Our approach first engages the community directly to determine the most pressing needs and cultural context, and then follows with a tangible solution first illustrated via advanced virtualization tools. We link existing challenge solutions to local drivers, and utilize an expanding library of templates, models and solutions with design-build innovations developed at World Peace One Communities and Education Innovation Hubs.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "World Peace One is launching a global movement for peace, reaching billions of people through concerts, music, games, and social media. This movement will focus people on envisioning how to transform their communities, cities, and nations into safer spaces that will unleash human innovation—giving a voice and power to all citizens. World Peace One Education and Communities works with residents, businesses, educators, and governments to transform neighborhoods step-by-step to more beautiful, usable, safer, eco-friendly, and innovative spaces.",

Only 28% of adults in SCLA report that produce where they shop is high quality, the lowest in the county. This toxic food environment dramatically affects our community’s health. Residents have the highest rates of obesity in the county, adults 36% and children 29%. Adults have the highest rate of diabetes 12% and hypertension 29%.

This is why the various strategies we employ to increase access to good food, produce stands, produce bags, corner stores, restaurants, bike deliveries etc. all have one thing in common, they target people where they already are. One of the things repeated to us again and again during the ACTION community food assessment (see http://csuinc.org/csuinc/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Report.pd) completed in 2004 was that people do not find farmers markets to be accessible given issues with transport and cash flow.

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Los Angeles is currently experiencing the beginnings of a travel renaissance. Its citizens are beginning to look toward an alternative to their cars. Through collaborations with advocates across the city we aim to catalyze a tipping point in this culture shift. In sharing local and international success stories we aim to increase awareness of the benefits of car-free travel, and encourage a greater demand for the infrastructure to support such options.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Our current supporters span the globe and have already inspired some grassroots activities in several other countries. Locally we have generated interest from local agencies in Los Angeles through attendance at community meetings and seminars, involvement in the CicLAvia press conference on two occasions, participation in the Music Center & Grand Park ‘Earth Day 2014’ event, and exploratory meetings with some of the city’s leaders in Alternative Travel advocacy and infrastructure.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One of the greatest barriers to growing the ATP community in Los Angeles is the perception of car-free travel and the link between cars and status. Travel without a car in LA is often seen as being a result of low socio-economic circumstance, rather than choice. Typically, attitudes in countries where multi-modal transportation is well developed, this is not the case. ‘People in the EU can see in their media that cycling is not done by cheap or poor people, that its done by people who value health, the community, the environment...It’s not something for those who have less power but more.’ Eljo Kamberaj – Ecovolis activist."

    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We partner with many organizations to grow our programs (New Learning Institute of the Pearson Foundation, LA Audubon, CoderDojo, GameDesk, Playmaker, Joan Ganz Cooney Center @ Sesame Workshop, Institute of Play, Everyone On, Pearson PLC), but for this grant we will be partnering with the Los Angeles chapter of the Network For Teaching Entrepreneurship to build our capacity to teach entrepreneurship and create a playbook for launching startups during middle and high school.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "In 2013 the Gallup Organization released the results of a poll on student motivation in school. They titled it, \"The School Cliff: Student Engagement Drops With Each School Year.\" The drop in middle and high school was precipitous. Students are disengaged from school. The poll analysis went on to say, \"among the many types of students whose engagement wanes during their time in the educational system are those who have high entrepreneurial talent. These are literally our economic saviors -- the future job creators for America.\"",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The first barrier we are facing is the tangle of state and district impediments to entrepreneurship in middle school classrooms, including the 69-pages of regulations on child labor issued by the State of California's Department of Industrial Relations and Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. A major Silicon Valley law firm has offered to work with us to help us navigate these issues.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Humans learn by doing. We've taken this simple truth and are forging a school and movement around it. By design learning environments with real world impacts, we help our students experience the joy of connecting knowledge and action. Tech is in our DNA; our students use it to explore, communicate, and make. We dismantle the boundaries between school and not-school; our middle schoolers meet with CEOs and journalists, they code, create websites, redesign beaches, present at conferences, do statistical samplings, and above all collaborate with each other and adults to launch startups. We want all students to have access to this way of schooling, so we'd like to build an online playbook to share our discoveries, methods, tools and curriculum.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "Los Angeles is the third most vibrant startup economy in the world, yet that energy has not made its way into our city's schools. We want to change that. Schools and the ideas of young people should be the drivers of the future and feed their visions into the startup world. Los Angeles has to tap youthful, out-of-the-box thinking to grow the economy towards LA2050. For this to happen, learning in LA needs to flow in every direction through the vast, diverse interconnected ecosystem that is our city. The Incubator School is a connector that facilitates this flow.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Building an entrepreneurial education for the 21st century, and a playbook to open source that education for all students and schools.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "We are a diverse, integrated LAUSD public school that anyone can attend: last year 39% of our students were low income, 47% were Latino, 32% White, 16% African American, 5% Asian; 19% Special Education, 15% Gifted and Talented. Our project will most immediately benefit them. This year we are expanding from 62 6th-7th graders to about 140 6th-8th graders. Each year we will add one additional grade.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Youth unemployment and underemployment",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We are requesting funding to 1) build out our programs, especially our entrepreneurship program, and 2) begin building out our playbook (the documentation of our programs, tools, and techniques so that other schools may adopt and adapt them).",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1) We have learned from the startup scene that continually iterating is vital to staying relevant. The world is changing very rapidly, and secondary students are barometers of that change. They're extremely sensitive to being current, and school, to stay relevant and become a springboard to a different future, has to be responsive. We do this through empathy, gathering data including regular student and parent surveys as well as student successes and areas of need, and then tweaking or revamping or completely pivoting on our systems to meet those needs.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Our project goals (building an 8th grade startup program and creating documentation for it so others can adapt it) are very concrete and manageable. If we are able to hire a staff person who is dedicated to this project, as well as use funds to train our teachers at NFTE University, we will be able to create an entrepreneurship program for our inaugural 8th grade class. Partnering with NFTE as well as the LAUSD and other area public, independent, and charter schools with whom we already have relationships will enable us to expand the reach of our program through our and their social networks. In addition, because of the extensive press we receive, we have a ready 'market' for our free playbook; we just don't have the staffing to be able to create it.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Start up education is a new frontier, and the Incubator School is one of its pioneers. As a free, diverse, open enrollment LAUSD public school that launched in 2013, we are bringing innovation to the second largest school district in the country. In fact, we're one of the only schools in the world working to combine entrepreneurship and schooling for middle and high school students."

    "projectRanking": "Winner",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Solo actor (just us on this project!)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Most approaches to youth unemployment are essentially the same: provide kids training and education to help them get jobs. Streetcraft LA has a different approach to youth unemployment. We provide education and training to empower youth to create their own jobs, their own network of professional peers, and their own apparel brands and creative services micro ventures. Entrepreneurship and the creative economy are the future. The factories are closed and design studios are hiring freelancers. This self-made creative economy is a natural fit for our kids. Streetcraft kids have a lot of creative capacity, energy and hustle, and only need the connections, positive peer support, and focused skill development to put those qualities to work.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Streetcraft LA is an initiative that is designed specifically to increase the number of minority youth led and owned micro ventures in the Los Angeles area. The program model specifically recruits young people who have an entrepreneurial spirit and aspirations and provides the technical skills to translate their raw creativity into a marketable product and then provides the professional mentoring and social capital to turn their product into a viable business plan. In addition Streetcraft bridges the barrier of social capital that faces marginalized young people striving to become successful entrepreneurs and grow their business, by intentionally providing access to funding and a platform in which these micro ventures can find financing and other professional services to launch their initiative",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "SBCC will work with independent evaluators, Dr. Todd Franke and Dr. Jorja Leap of UCLA, both of whom have extensive experience evaluating the impact of community-based youth development and workforce development initiatives for clients including First 5 LA, the LA County Department of Children and Family Services, The California Wellness Foundation, and SBCC's own adult career development programs.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Streetcraft LA is a social venture of the South Bay Center for Community Development (SBCC), a long-standing non-profit organization that has been working to empower low-income communities in the greater Los Angeles area since 1974. Throughout our history, job-training programs have represented a key strategy in this work. Typically, our career pathways have worked by collaborating with employers in a targeted employment sector, supporting participants to receive required training and providing social support toward completion, and then facilitating the hiring and retention process.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "How do we help kids create their own jobs in the creative economy? Streetcraft LA’s approach to launching creative micro-ventures is a three-step model we call engage, partner, and launch. First, we engage youth who are on a path leading to dropout, unemployment, and juvenile justice involvement—or who are already misapplying their creative capacity through graffiti—in a training and youth development program we call The Streetcraft Crew. Crew is a yearlong program taught by well-known street artists that empowers at-risk kids to see themselves as artists, designers, and entrepreneurs, by building the design and production skills needed for creative economy entrepreneurship, and by developing the character traits and peer relationships needed to effectively apply those skills to entrepreneurship and ongoing education. Crew functions not only as a positive intervention in the life of at risk youth, but also serves as the Streetcraft human resources department, sourcing the true talent that is ready for step two, a formal paid apprenticeship in Streetcraft LA's retail platform and design studio.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "The unemployment rate in Los Angeles County during June 2014 stood at 8.2%--significantly higher than the statewide rate of 7.4%. Given the ratio between overall unemployment rates, and rates for youth ages 16-19 in recent years, this leads us to estimate a youth unemployment rate in LA County of more than 28%.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Streetcraft LA is no longer a startup venture and has already conducted an extensive planning stage to test three assumptions: marginalized youth engaged in graffiti culture or other illicit entrepreneur activities have talents that can be re-directed; a process of engagement can be created including partnerships with public systems and community based social networks; and youths' talents can be monetized and professionalized. Streetcraft piloted its model with 50 individuals, referred through probation and other community-based networks, who went through a work-based contextualized learning experience and developed products for a retail store located on Main Street, Santa Monica. During this pilot period 100% of participants completed the pilot and 85% percent increased their annual income by 50% or more.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Streetcraft empowers low income, at risk, and unemployed youth to improve their economic future through creative economy entrepreneurship.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Juan was arrested when he was 15 for running a 25-person drug ring. When Streetcraft's co-founder Jonathan met Juan he was 18 years old, out of jail, trying to change his life, but he was hopeless. Juan told Jonathan that he had no skills or talents. Jonathan categorically disagreed. “No skills? 25 person drug ring?” he said. “You're an entrepreneur, but we got to get you another product.”",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Streetcraft has a number of strategic partners. First, we will work with our network of Neighborhood Action Councils (NACs) to refer youth into the program. Future referral partners will include youth development community based organizations seeking career opportunities for marginalized young people such as the Boys & Girls Club, YMCAs, and others. In addition, Streetcraft is currently developing a partnership with LAPD in several key neighborhoods to work with youth being released into the community from juvenile detention facilities. Lastly, Streetcraft's model is contingent upon utilizing workforce investment funds, and has worked since its inception to engage local workforce investment boards interested in entrepreneurship as an ongoing sustainable funding source.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Streetcraft LA's leadership team has conducted extensive Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat (SWOT) analyses that have identified key obstacles. First, Streetcraft's model is contingent upon creating a network of profitable retail platforms. Given the lack of retail background among the majority of nonprofit leadership staff, this could pose a significant challenge to SBCC's capacities. We have addressed this challenge by engaging outside technical assistance on retail best practices such as inventory management systems, supply chain management, and wholesale."

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "WriteGirl is an esteemed educational model for organizations across the country. In 2013, WriteGirl received the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award, the highest national honor awarded to exemplary afterschool and out-of-school time programs from across the country. In 2014, WriteGirl Executive Director Keren Taylor was named a CNN Hero. In expanding WriteGirl’s presence through this new Write Place for Girls, WriteGirl will be a more visible inspiration for other nonprofits and educational institutions throughout Los Angeles, helping to make 2050 a time when all youth have inspiring places and mentors to guide them to their full potential.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have a track record of success. We have amazing partners. We have outstanding dedicated volunteers. We have a skilled team of qualified staff members. Our board provides insightful guidance and direction. And now, after 12 years, we have a dream partnership with the Goodwill Community Enrichment Center and an opportunity to collaborate to build a vital community program - the Write Place for Girls.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The WriteGirl “Write Place for Girls” afterschool program will provide a safe place for LA teen girls to write, create and connect. Since 2001, WriteGirl has paired underserved teen girls with professional women writers for mentoring, creative writing workshops, public readings and award-winning publications. WriteGirl offers exceptional programming to inspire girls to develop their voices and their confidence. In a city where only 66% of students graduate from high school, WriteGirl has had a 13-year record of guiding 100% of its seniors to enroll in college. WriteGirl has partnered with the Goodwill Enrichment Center to create a unique writing center in the underserved Northeast Los Angeles region - the Write Place for Girls.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Building this center for girls in Northeast Los Angeles is a deliberate choice, recognizing the urgent need for creative programming for diverse youth in the area. Glassell Park, Atwater Village, Eagle Rock, Montecito Heights, Highland Park and Cypress Park have very few community centers to serve this low-income, high-density region of LA. Less than a dozen community centers serve the 243,000 residents in this area, and only several offer academic and creative programs for teens.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "We have seen that girls are in dire need of a full slate of college preparation resources, job skills and leadership development to truly give them the tools, community, confidence and tenacious communication skills they need to thrive in college, the workplace and in life. WriteGirl offers college preparation and attainment programming, internships and career awareness programs, and a growing alumnae support network. In addition to receiving college preparation guidance, participants in The Write Place for Girls will have the opportunity to pursue internships and other career-focused programming offered by WriteGirl, learning job and leadership skills that will make them competitive in the workforce.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "For many years, WriteGirl has offered workshops and creative programming for girls at community centers, museums, parks and theaters all over greater Los Angeles. While girls have enjoyed learning songwriting at Disney Hall and poetry at the Autry Museum, we have seen that girls need the consistency of a calm and positive space that’s just for them.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Percentage of community college students completing a certificate, degree, or transfer-related program in six years",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. Teen girls in Los Angeles County face enormous challenges, such as high unemployment rates, high gang and criminal activity and extremely limited availability of educational and/or mentoring programs. WriteGirl recruits girls from high-density, low-income neighborhoods, where many schools enroll up to 4,000 students. These large schools are unable to serve the individual needs of teen girls, or offer specific college application and financial aid assistance, help with family or emotional challenges or even academic and literacy skill development. Guidance counselors are often assigned hundreds of students, prohibiting access to higher education.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1. Recruiting, training and managing the additional number of volunteers needed to support the Write Place for Girls presents a challenge, but we have been pursuing various solutions to address this. In terms of recruitment, WriteGirl is partnering several new organizations this summer to enlist new volunteers through participation in large-scale community events, such as the Writer’s Digest Novel Writing Conference, and the 2014 KCON Korean Festival, while continuing to recruit volunteers from prominent companies and organizations including the the Writers Guild of America, the Los Angeles Times, Disney, Paramount, Time Warner, Fox, HBO and Roll International, among many others. Volunteers complete a rigorous training program and dedicate a total of more than 1,500 hours each month to support WriteGirl programs. Communication with such a large volunteer corps assisting WriteGirl in many different capacities can present a challenge, but WriteGirl has recently invested in new technology, software and databases that will help facilitate effective communication with our valued volunteers.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "WriteGirl has developed relationships with dozens of partners, including the Goodwill Enrichment Center, the Los Angeles Times, Fox Studios, Writers Guild of America, and others that provide wide-ranging resources from venues to volunteers to financial support. We have worked with most of our partners for many years, and they have increased their support as we have grown. Our newest partner, the Goodwill Community Enrichment Center, represents much more than a new space, but a powerful collaboration for hundreds of youth and their families.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will measure success of The Write Place for Girls program by 1) tracking program hours to deliver a minimum of 30 group programming hours and 90 hours of one-one-one mentoring per month; 2) enrolling an additional 50 neighborhood girls to add to our current 150 girls in the program’s first year; 3) conducting comprehensive pre- and post-season assessments with participants to track metrics such as confidence, writing ability and the relationship between WriteGirl activities/curriculum and school/career achievement, and 4) evaluating program success through surveys with stakeholders such as partners, parents, family members and teachers."

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Eat:1) Access to eateries in accordance with their fitness regimen. Users will see incentives/promotions associated with respective eateries as well as reward redemption sites for when users reach a milestone/target such as, walking 15,000 steps in a day and receiving a free yogurt at an establishment. 2) Access to local stores that provide organic, and healthy foods. Promotions exclusive for users such as discounts, sales, and freebies. 3)Depending on user target goals, our program will determine several meal plans for the user to choose from or provide healthy easy to make recipes. Health:1) Users will be given locations to the needed medical services and if determined to be a basic ailment by AI, will be provided with recommendations for treatment options. They will also be provided locations of closest pharmacies, and shops for prescription or over the counter medication. Users will also be given options from which to get insurance for those uninsured including an interfaced link to government health care. Individuals with mental illness will receive information to seek appropriate help from service providers near them. 2)The percent of residents receiving coordinated health care will be one of the dream metrics which we will impact by serving underserved populations with limited access to hospitals and medication by mobilizing mobile clinics to visit communities several times or based on need by users for free healthcare services. Life:Sensors placed in communities and data retrieved from other sources will allow us to provide users with live time information on current air toxins, air quality index, as well as general information of water usage as determined by the Department of Water and Power and then continuous recommendations for users to improve these metrics. Homes that conserve water will receive incentives from different companies. Changing user behavior now will significantly reduce pollution in the waterways by 2050 while at the same time. 3)Access to pair individuals with jobs will be available to homeless people in a simple, easy to use online resume building and basic interview skill set. Fitness: Users can be structured a workout regimen that is tailored with their diet. This program will also use the phones system to monitor a steps, calories burned, incline, exercise rate, bike, transit score and sleep cycle (healthy sleeping habits). Users will be more inclined to keep fit if they see incentivized live progress.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Barriers we anticipate is: 1) Getting people to use the app 2) Falsification of data to redeem rewards 3) Mobile Clinic Mobilization to a mass community",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Our project may seem like a simple application however it uses complex algorithms, not introduced to a free market before, to target an entire city rather than just concentrate on a specific group of individuals. Los Angeles will be the first city to have an app dedicated to its’ residents and their well being. It seeks to bring preventative healthcare to all (through multiple methods) while basic clinical care onsite to others and access to clinical care to those with more severe cases. The software will be ready to use upon release to the public as information will already have been collected for recommendations to be made upon individualized data points. Individuals will be aware of their dietary, fitness and health habits everyday and will be provided with recommendations and incentives along the way for improvements to their health. Through the integration of social networks, LA, by 2050, will be fully aware of their eating, fitness, and health. The AI system will have more than enough data points to reference to create more sophisticated regiments for individuals.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our project aims for a top-down approach. Our aim is to initially approach several regions of LA for beta testing and sensor placement. This includes but is not limited to Westwood, Santa Monica, Venice, Downtown LA, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades, East LA, and Bel Air. This project will benefit three levels within LA. It will benefit 1) the population down to single individuals, 2) their respective communities and 3) City of Los Angeles. Based on the results from receptiveness of the population, the City of LA will be given extensive review and recommendations for improvement and or addition of low cost sensors to reduce and eliminate unhealthy air quality and pollution in the city. More specifically, this program will be accessible to anyone with a mobile device or computer ( from home, work, or pocket). Those without a mobile device will be able to easily access the program through a public library as everyones profile will be unique to them and their location. There is no separation of income barrier as this project is intended to target every individual from different communities. According to the CDC, obesity rates are rising in LA County–24.3% of adults while more than 20% of students in junior high school are obese. While this program will benefit everyone, there will be several more incentivized based models for age groups between 12-18, and 18-40.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Please note, we will be doing tasks simultaneously as we have a wide range of student body to help with the program.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "UCLA Medicine and Undergraduate School collaborate to bring a comprehensive method of promoting healthy habits and better health to LA",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "UCLA Advance Heart Failure and UCLA Undergraduate Schools (Life Sciences, Computer Science) are collaborating to create an app and sensors built around the needs and metrics of the LA community. At the same time, we seek to support local businesses by pairing up with them to provide incentives to community members when visiting these businesses.It will use both AI (artificial intelligence) algorithms and user feedback to provide the best recommendations in multiple aspects of daily life to LA residents; Eat, Health, Life, Fitness. We are looking to collaborate with LA2050 to create a model that provides access to both clinical and preventative care through various platforms while integrating a degree of social networks within them.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "With a population of close to 4 million individuals, it is a stretch to make LA the healthiest city with campaigns and small scale projects. Rather it is more beneficial to approach the issue of quality of life and health care from a holistic point view accessible by ease from everyone while looking at preventative as well as clinical care. As such, we will need to approach the goal of a healthy city by determining metrics that are related to each other and their prevalence in their respective communities.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We are collaborating with a range of individuals and groups, all of whom who come from various backgrounds and expertise. All of the following collaborators are confirmed and all of whom we have worked with in the past on several successful projects.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Success will be measured on several factors. While we would want all of LA to use this program at once, we can see results from a small population from which data can be extracted.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "It has been shown through studies and through basic human nature that we work on a rewards mechanism. If asked to do something, people are more inclined to follow through with the request and follow up with it if they are given something back in return. You cannot simply expect something to be done for free. Thats why while providing a service and asking residents of the LA community to strive for a better city and life, we are aiming to provide them with incentives for reaching certain goals and metrics. Past campaigns that targeted similar metrics did not create success on a large scale or at all due to the fact that either: 1) They did not maintain a continuous support structure that can be integrated within an individual's daily life and/or 2) reward them for improving themselves."

We then will empower the community to become more civically active through voting and participation in their local neighborhood council.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "During the 2013 mayoral election in Los Angeles, 222,300 people (12.4% of registered voters) voted in Eric Garcetti, the lowest voting numbers for newly elected mayors since the 1930’s. Only 5%-6% percent of the total population made the decision for the entire city. California’s population is about 38 million. Latinos represent about 32% of the California’s adult population but only 16% of them are likely to vote. Non-Hispanic Whites make up 46% of California’s adult population and 66% of them are more likely to vote. These two lessons/issues inform us Hispanics/Latinos in California are less likely to vote than that of Non-Hispanic Whites. By raising the Hispanic/Latino voting by just a few percentages, we can impact local and statewide elections. In the last Los Angeles mayoral election, a small increase in voting percentages could have easily changed the election outcome. What this information is also telling us is that full representation of all people in California is not being reflected in our electoral processes. Our political system is in need of individuals and communities to become more civically active in order for more of the population being represented when decisions are being made and when election are being decided.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "In 12 months, we will activate 100 people in the community of Lincoln Heights in volunteerism and service who would otherwise not do it on their own. This will include surveying people in the community, participating in educational forums, participating in local neighborhood council meetings and city council meetings. Our ultimate goal is to inspire our community members to one day become neighborhood council members themselves.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One of the barriers we will face is getting the community to become open about sharing their feelings and viewpoints about social issues and what they care about. Within family settings, the workplace, and school, discussing social issues can be tricky and sometimes controversial especially when you encounter people who are really passionate about a particular subject. We will have to develop relationships with community members and leaders and utilize great communication strategies. Partnering up with existing organization and institutions like churches and schools can help us with initiating conversations and we can begin to build trust with community members.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "By reaching out to local organizations, churches, neighborhood councils, and community centers, we will survey a minimum of 300 people. Through our existing program LEAD YouthBuild, a leadership development program that empowers youth ages 18-24 to finish their high school diplomas and connect them to meaningful careers and post-secondary education, we will incorporate community outreach and organizing into our curriculums and give them service-learning experiences that will include surveying people in the community. This project will serve many purposes that include: gathering of important community data, leadership opportunities for young people through hands-on organizational and community outreach experience, and it will shed a positive light on young people who would otherwise be seen as disengaged and at-risk. In partnership with UCLA's Urban Planning Department, the surveys will be analyzed and data will be compiled together to serve as documented research describing community needs and the gaps between current conditions and desired conditions. The results will then be presented to the community through educational forums where dialogues will be facilitated about civic responsibility and engagement in order to address community needs. LEAD will then launch a voter registration campaign that will register a minimum of 200 people to vote. We will then host a series of workshops and educational forums with the goal of empowering people to become active voters and active participants in local neighborhood council meetings and city council meetings. This is the first step in trying to impact community change is by defining community needs and creating leadership opportunities that will ignite dialogues with those that have the power to make the changes happen. But civic participation does not stop there. LEAD will facilitate and organize working groups between Angelenos of Lincoln Heights, local elected officials, and the local neighborhood council to find common grounds and create strategies and plans that would address community needs. The goal would also be to identify services and resources that currently exist in the community and identify gaps where services and resources are needed.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "When politics and voting is brought up in the community, we commonly hear things like “My vote does not matter,” “One person can’t make a difference,” and “Politicians don’t care about me and what I think about.” Part of the sentiment may derive from the community feeling not fully represented when decision are being made about their community. When you begin to ask people what they personally care about and what solutions they would propose, many times you receive genuine and innovative responses. What if we can restore a voice to the community of Lincoln Heights? What if we can gather enough people together and create dialogues where people begin to discover that they are not alone in wanting community change? What if we can build bridges between elected officials and the neighborhood council and changes begin to happen? Small changes and small victories can lead to big changes and big victories. The community will feel represented. This project will begin to pull out information from the community and make that information carry value. By creating dialogues between community members, the neighborhood council, and elected officials, commonalities can be discovered or produced and evidence of changes happening will ignite the community to want to stay connected and stay active.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "LEAD has built a great reputation locally and nationally and we have been able to build partnership with several individuals and organization. Our goal of putting forth a community needs assessment, followed by a voter registration campaign and dialogues between elected officials, the neighborhood council, and community members are goals that we have the capacity and knowledge to execute. Two members of our Board of Directors are connected to their local neighborhood councils: Hector Huezo is the Chair of the Neighborhood Council Alliance of River Communities and is a Neighborhood Council Budget Advocate; Albert Ramirez is a member of the Wilmington Neighborhood Council. In addition, another Board Member, Frank Alvarez, is a Senior Organizer with Los Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE), with more than 10 years’ experience in community organizing, capacity building, and advocacy. They will help us put together a plan for working with Lincoln Neighborhood Council and help us navigate through local politics. They have years of experience in engaging community members in local politics and will be assets to us in this project. Because of our LEAD YouthBuild Program, we have ongoing programs which we can tap into and use for the benefit of this project. We will be able to leverage multiple streams of funding in conjunction with funding from LA2050. We have built a solid foundation of individual donors and supporters that we can easily tap into for support in this project. We are strategically located in the center of Lincoln Heights and our site is easily accessible to the community.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "LEAD will facilitate a community needs assessment, voter education and registration campaign, and ignite civic engagement in Lincoln Heights",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This project will benefit the community of Lincoln Heights which has a population of about 31,500 people. The community is predominantly Hispanic/Latino with the next largest group of people is Chinese/Asian. The unemployment level is 12.7% and 36% of the population there is living at or below the poverty level. The high school dropout rate in Lincoln Heights is 33%. This project will aim to impact the following groups of people:",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Rates of volunteerism: LEAD YouthBuild will incorporate of this project into our educational curriculum, and we will empower young people to volunteer in the community of Lincoln Heights. At minimum, 65 young people will volunteer and survey the community. At the same time gain leadership skills and job skills. We will invite community members to volunteer and instill in them the idea that service is the first steps they can take in making community change. One way they can serve their community is by attending local neighborhood council meetings and voicing their opinions."

Vorenberg, President of ArtAge and a nationally recognized expert in senior theatre, and according to AARP, senior theatre is one of the fastest-growing recreation and culture trends in the country. Los Angeles stands to benefit from this growing trend with the niche entertainment that Senior Star Power offers. The city is already actively involved in supporting theatre venues as a key component in all arts- and culture-promotion projects with a special emphasis on Hollywood and the downtown Broadway areas. It was noted recently that Los Angeles saw a record-breaking 42.1 million visitors in 2013, a factor which will drive city investment in tourism in years to come. With the influx of new and innovative creative theatre, LA can reach the 50 million+ visitors goal. A case in point: In 2012, Branson, Missouri welcomed over 7.3 million visitors. Tourism is the Branson/Lakes Area's chief industry, with an estimated $2.9 billion in tourism-related spending in 2012. Average age of visitors was 58 years. 79% of activities participated in were shows. Senior Star Power can bring these tourists and their spending power to Los Angeles."

While we don’t support the LA River haphazardly flooding, carefully constructed basins allowing saturation into unused industrial lots could create a flood plain corridor that runs along the LA River and makes use of the network of storm drains receiving water from the mountains and the hills around Northeast LA. Eemian age plants, from roughly 115,000 years ago would be introduced to prepare for a climate change, creating a prophetic ecology along the river corridor. Climatologists predict that the climate experienced during that time is close to that which we will be facing in 50-100 years",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "The Metabolic Studio transforms nutrients into energy, actions, and objects that nurture life.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Undevelopment One will be the pilot project for a hoped for network of Undevelopments that could, over time, create a paleo-botanical eavesment by redefining our historic flood plain. We have counted around 25 storm drains and about as many potential brownfields that are candidates for Undevelopment. By Undeveloping we mean pounding out unused tarmac and concrete and adding water and letting the land regain agency. Lauren Bon and The Metabolic Studio are about to break ground on a waterwheel which will bring LA river water back up to the city. When construction begins in early 2015, the Harrison studio is proposing that cores be drilled down to the Eemian, 115,000 years ago, in order to conduct the appropriate pollen analysis to locate the species that had once lived there. Undevelopment One would take one of several possible sites along the edge of the LA River, reconnect it to LA River water, and establish on that site a greenhouse inside which potential future plant ensembles would be grown and released in the larger environment, in small experimental sites over the years as the weather warms. Our hope is that inspired cooperation among land owners and agencies will allow remediation without necessarily owning and controlling the land. We hope to educate through Undevelopment One that Another City Is Possible, one in which we are connected by a common goal to see LA survive into the future with a limited water supply and warming temperatures and see water as a human right and a social commodity. We see this as a kind of utilitarian prophecy that is at the same time a botanical adventure.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "It should be understood that both the Metabolic Studio and the Harrison Studio see the Undevelopment proposal as a new urban narrative. Climatologists predict that the climate experienced during the Eemian Age is close to that which we will be facing in 50-100 years. We note that many cities in the world, perhaps a majority, have profoundly mistreated their river systems. The model that the Harrison Studio and Metabolic Studio wish to put in place is replicable as cities around the world realize that a new way to justify their relationship to nature and the larger environment within which they are embedded has been made available. Our hope is that all artists, engineers, politicians, urban planners and visionaries network plans, funding and initiatives to address entropy rebalancing—meaning that all living systems move toward entropy, but that rate of that process in contemporary society, the stress on nature and on all our living systems is such that we can no longer think of any individual city but rather of collective actions that can rebalance entropy.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The Harrison Studio has been looking at the Arroyo Seco’s repurposing since the mid 1980’s. First proposing a transformation of the lower Arroyo, then arguing for the restoration of the Arroyo Seco River and thereafter, redesigning the Devil’s Gate debris basin, which later became Hahamonga Watershed Park in Pasadena. Lauren Bon and The Metabolic Studio transformed a train yard into a cornfield in 2005. Notacornfield brought the Los Angeles State Historic Park into public consciousness. Ninety miles of irrigation stripping were used to irrigate what used to be a cornfield irritated by the unbridled LA River. Since that time they have been working to reconnect land and water in Los Angeles and in the Owens Valley where much of our urban water is sourced. Bending the River Back Into the City, a three part metabolic sculpture, will make a permanent reconnection possible. The studio is interested in extending the capacity of the waterwheel to include a large distribution network. Together the Harrison Studio and The Metabolic Studio see Council District One in Los Angeles as a political area that can become a role model in how water can be seen as social capital capable of supporting community and creating the capacity for environmental renewal."

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Our current challenges, programmatically, are a lack of space and infrastructure for growing our Arts Mentorship Program capacity. Because we do not have an office space where we can meet with our current students, we are reliant on public places such as the library and other community centers. This is not a problem when working in particular mediums of art, such as drawing and creative writing, however, when our students want to explore painting and mixed media, we often times have to become creative in how we teach them these skills. Occasionally, this has meant teaching wet media techniques in the park or in our private residence. Additionally, when teaching them work-readiness and entrepreneurial skills, not having a classroom-like environment can become distracting for our students. We often times lack a way to visually represent concepts because we do not have a whiteboard or chalkboard at our disposal.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "We at DSTL Arts are expanding our current Arts Mentorship Program's capacity, offering art workshops & establishing our own art gallery.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "DSTL Arts has been in operation for the past year and a half providing mentorship in the arts to a cohort of 8 creative, at-risk youth, and this grant will help us expand our capacity and infrastructure by establishing a central gallery space that will act as a hub for managing student mentorships, the training of new Arts-Mentor volunteers, and the offering of diverse arts-programming and arts workshops to the general community."

Working hand-in-hand with Green Dot & Locke faculty offered valuable lessons about how to innovate within established institutions. Doing the job well requires deep consideration & incorporation of many stakeholders. But most importantly, interacting with Locke students first hand, seeing how thirsty they are for resources, mentors, and information, listening to their hopes, dreams & feedback was transformational. It was impossible not to see the enormous window of opportunity to build upon NRBLB & Green Dot’s succeeding efforts. When we discovered that for the first time in nearly 30 years, Green Dot is investing THIS year to revitalize Locke’s music program, we knew the opportunity to contribute was unparalleled.

Also, we are training the next generation of leaders who will use all the methods available to them --- both online and off --- to engage their peers to become involved with this project. The culture of the target group of youth is shifting and will continue to shift from a veil of silence to a bullhorn of communication. It is “cool” for this group to: talk about, hold each other accountable, know early on the signs, understand options of what to do and where to go at an early age for help, readily discuss and engage themselves in scenarios when they see their peers in trouble instead of “turning a blind eye”.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Funds obtained through MY LA 2050 will benefit over 1000 unserved and underserved youth ages (11-18) in Los Angeles County.

The goal of \"Youth Conversations” is to educate youth about the warning signs of domestic violence and give youth an opportunity to discuss how domestic violence can be prevented. “Youth Conversations” events will provide an opportunity to discuss domestic violence without the stigma that is usually associated with this issue. Young people will learn about the cycle of violence, where to get help, and what to do if they or their friends are ever involved in unhealthy relationships.",

BeSO You! is one of our signature teen dating violence prevention programs that educates youth on healthy relationships, domestic violence and respect in ways that challenge them to redefine what “normal” is when it comes to relationship violence. The series of workshops is geared towards middle and high school students from all socio and economic backgrounds. Many of the participants of this program view “dramatic relationships” as normal or even “ideal.” Some participants have even stated that if they were not in a “dramatic relationship” they would be \"bored\" or\" wonder if their partner even cared\". The purpose of BeSO You! is to get this population to begin to embrace healthier ideas around violence and respect and teach them how to have healthy relationships early on so that they never find themselves in the cycle of abuse that may lead to them one day needing shelter. Since its inception in 2009, BeSO You! has educated more than 1000 children and youth.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementing this project in the next twelve months is achievable because we have already begun to the do the work. The previous “Conversation” events and workshops are the successful templates that we will use to expand what we are already doing. As we come out of the pilot phase of this initiative we have a very good idea of what works, what doesn’t work and what some of the gaps are."

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Number of public transit riders:",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Many social critics have warned of the increasing problem of alienation in our modern world. Los Angeles in particular has been criticized for its automobile dependency and lack of public spaces. “Nobody walks in LA” is a common trope, even though real Angelenos know this simply is not true. Collectively, our streets and sidewalks are an immense public space that unite the entire metropolis. All of us who have traversed our vast city on foot know that while there can certainly be frustrations (loud traffic and smog, lack of shade, missing crosswalks), there are also an endless supply of pleasant surprises which are only noticeable when on foot: the redtail hawk perched on a telephone poll, the subtle head nod of a passing stranger, or the aroma of sizzling onions from the bacon-wrapped hot dog vendor. Other small pleasures come from personal experience or historical knowledge: “I can't believe those concrete slabs on the hillside were once part of a bridge that took streetcars into Downtown” or “I remember when we would buy paletas and walk home along the bank of the river.” Our experience walking the streets of Los Angeles have taught us an invaluable lesson: stepping out of our cars brings a deeper and more satisfying connection to the spaces of our city. The goal of Trail City LA is to encourage Angelenos to walk, not simply for transportation, but for the enjoyment and connection to place it provides.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Given the city-wide and open-nature objective of Trail City, our challenge will be to use an inclusive and participatory design process which results in the most usable and productive tool. We want to implement a public design process which results in a technological platform that is reflective of our unique city and its people. Usually the design and development of technology applications involves a few specialists creating for many users. But given the common-good intentions of Trail City LA a true participatory design process including a broad and diverse set of constituencies is necessary.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "A city-wide, community-based urban trails authoring platform. This web-based tool enables community organizations, interest groups, and the public to create a network of connected trails revealing new perspectives on LA and its people. Accessible as a mobile website the resulting web of walking paths and site specific content enable engagement with the city’s past, present, and future.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Employing participatory design approaches, our experienced UCLA-based creative team will build a web-based trail creation tool utilizing an iterative process that includes an ongoing dialogue with a core set of diverse community stakeholders. Participants will design trails while the technology is being developed, using prototypes, while outlining the features that will best enable them to construct meaningful urban walking experiences. Our confirmed community collaborators (LA Commons, CityLife-LA, and Franklin High School’s Arroyo Seco Academy) represent a diversity of perspectives and geographies in the city. To ground and enrich the development experience, each group will be tasked with creating a neighborhood-based interactive trail expressive of their own collective identity. Each group will also be asked to consider the possible thematic interconnections with the other groups and connect to each others' trails.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "We are building a tool that will benefit all Angelenos.

Urban planners could broaden community participation in the planning process by asking stakeholders to build trails that reveal the aspects they love about their neighborhood, but also its challenges. The planners themselves could build trails which explain their priorities and expertise. The trail authoring platform is a way to connect ideas and dialogue with movement through physical space. It is a tool that, once built, can be appropriated for an endless array of uses, all of which will contribute to the making of Trail City.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "A “trail” is a rough path worn through woods, mountains, or other geographies. It is also a stream of things--dust, light, people, ideas, memories, stories--that flows behind something moving. We embrace both of these meanings, asking Angelenos to blaze new trails by examining the flow of history and experience that surrounds us all. By sharpening our sensory experience, opening ourselves to our surroundings, and unearthing the stories embedded in the world around us, we can learn to be present, engaged, and connected with our communities. Trail City LA encourages users to break with their everyday relationship to space, challenging them to open their minds and bodies to the wealth of culture hidden in plain sight.",

When all parties are not on the same page, it takes longer for the goal to be achieved.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The best part about our project is that it's already rockin' and rollin'! Our new partnership with the Association of Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors (APSAC) provides us with access to over 400 attendance counselors, all eager to work hard to assure their students have the best possible education they can. Together, we have created many opportunities for these students to not only improve their education, but their way of life.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "As always, any organization's main barrier when it comes to fully implementing a project is secruing the funds necessary to operate at full capacity. Every year, we’ve expanded our efforts to cover an increasing amount of students in schools, therefore, the need arises to find and secure additional funds. On top of that, as we progress through the year, student enrollment increases as students begin to attend school more often and qualify to join us in celebrating excellent and perfect attendance. Although that is a GREAT problem to have, it is still a problem that needs to addressed!",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Our \"School is Cool\" initiative is designed to help our students develop a love of education and adopt the tools needed to thrive in and out of the classroom. We give students the supplies they need to build confidence. We reward students with incentives for perfect attendance, encouraging them to come to school every day. We show kids that college is an achievable dream and give them something to reach for.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "In 2011, TaT launched our “School is Cool” initiative targeting at-risk students enrolled in local public schools. Since it's launch, TaT has been committed to engaging parents, students, school staff, and community members toward a common vision of graduation for all students! Unfortunately, while there is a significant need for attendance improvement services and support throughout all of LAUSD, limited program funding requires our initiative to focus on the highest risk (Title 1) schools. By motivating and teaching students to value the importance of attendance, we believe we can help bridge the gap between the educational inequities that currently exist.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We have many different ways of measuring the success of our \"School is Cool\" initiative. Working directly with LAUSD's schools, counselors, and teachers allows us to maintain record of any given student's attendance in any school. We track progress daily, weekly, monthly and annually as students' attendance rates progressively increase. Tying this metric of measurement to the students that receive backpacks with school supplies provides further proof of our program's success.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "It’s a fact that students who attend school consistently are more successful in school than students who do not. That may seem obvious, but what’s less obvious are that the consequences of low attendance are serious for all children and their community. Did you know that every year, over 1 million students drop out of high school in the United States alone? That’s one student every 26 seconds, or 7,000 students a day. Students who are frequently absent fall behind in academics and miss important socialization concepts that enhance their ability to understand and follow directions and, ultimately, plan for the future. As students fail to graduate from high school, the number of educated and skilled workers in the job market also decreases, leaving holes in the workforce economy. In addition, state financial support for schools is directly linked to student attendance. When students are absent the school loses money.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Currently, students living at or below the poverty line lack access to sufficient school supplies, and budget cuts to our school systems leave schools and teachers unable to provide these at risk children with the necessary items. It's estimated that 16 million kids in the US will return to school this year without the supplies they need. The burden is being placed on both the students and the teachers to fulfill these needs, neither of whom have the resources to fill the gap.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Over the years, TaT has established many community partners along the way, but none have been as integral to the success of our \"School is Cool\" initiative as the Los Angeles Dodgers, Keystone Press, Build-a-Bear, Wal-Mart, Kroger, Ralph's and Panera Bread. Together, we have built a solid foundation around shared values focused on improving our communities today, for tomorrow.",

    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our goal is to encourage grandmas and kids to play together to grow food, share seeds, improve water conservation and energy/climate resiliency for people of all ages and backgrounds. At the farm we playtest with all ages and our team comes from 4 ethnic backgrounds with diverse experience in food/climate intervention for disaster relief.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 PLAY metrics?": "Access to open space and park facilities",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We are creating a game jam series of hack events and building a creative team based in Los Angeles and Vista, CA to make SEEDS the Game, a social action ecosystem of games for mobile devices. SEEDS the Game encourages players to tackle real life food security challenges by going outside and creating gardens at home and with their community.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "We aim to help people grow beautiful places wherever they are - in the backyard, on the roof, at home in the windowsill, in community gardens and schools all over Los Angeles. We will be measuring how many people play along, what actions they take, the cumulative community impact of their gameplay and qualitatively we will capture social media stories and short videos on intergenerational play through the game activities.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Our first major barrier has been additional startup funding. Initial $100,000 will get us started in Los Angeles but our full game development budget would require at least a million dollars to release SEEDS The Game as a series of apps in the primary mobile app stores. That is relatively a good figure given to the amount of features SEEDS the Game will have and the data sets we can provide for NGOs and government agencies.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "Los Angeles already has some of the most beautiful parks, gardens, and farmers’ markets in the world. Our project will get more citizens outside and interacting with the beauty we know is already there, as well as teaming up to create more green spaces and transform problem areas.",

    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Collaborators that are confirmed include Growcology (a nonprofit organization for permaculture education based in Southern California), Southern California Permaculture Guild, the global Seed Libraries network, Project Nuevo Mundo (community food growth nonprofit) along with project partnerships at school gardens, Burners without Borders and development allies at major universities: USC Games for talent in game design, UC Riverside for talent in animation and storytelling for games, JMU for data/climate integration and allies from the CalTech innovation community currently assisting with engineering and backend design.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will based our evaluation on three levels starting with 1) Analytics 2) Statistical Research and 3) Impact over Profit.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Our first lesson learned so far is that SEEDS as a project, game and series of events requires community participation and organic engagement from people from all walks of life to create the best possible experience for players. We have created prototypes of various aspects of gameplay and as we play test and explore what mechanics and systems work best for people we have found that lots of community design feedback is the key to making this series of game apps fun and easy to play for people of all ages and backgrounds. Today we use less words and more art in our designs to be more multilingual and easier to use for first-timers.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Our development cycle is to create SEEDS the Game is achievable within the next twelve months starting by creating a team of passionate and skilled developers and programmers. We will do a outreach and marketing campaign that would generate the necessary funds to make through the three development stages: 1) Alpha - first round testing, 2) Beta - second round testing with funders and partners, 3) Release - Public Release. We will also invite the non-profit organizations, schools, after-school organizations, and local businesses to be involved in our testing."

    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Voting rates by race",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Our first challenge will be to convince voters and likely voters that their vote counts and a better option is available to learn about what's on their ballot. Los Angeles already experienced record low voter turnout during the June 2014 primary indicating a lack of enthusiasm and interest in our elections. Voting is not a priority for many people in our city – we believe this is because the information is not being communicated in a dynamic format people in LA have come to expect. It will be challenging to overcome the voter apathy experienced by millions of Angelenos, however, we believe it is a challenge worth facing considering the long-term dire consequences of a disinterested voting population.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "SeePolitical explains the confusing language for each ballot proposition in less than two minutes with our engaging and unbiased videos.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "SeePolitical.com is an interactive website, widget and mobile app providing objective, easily understood information about ballot propositions for all Angelenos. Trying to understand the complex language found on most ballots is frustrating and often results in uninformed voters approving unintended consequences. In the case for our region, most voters are not even participating. The June 2014 primary turned out an alarmingly record-low number of voters in Los Angeles County.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "SeePolitical will truly benefit everyone in LA. Residents who feel it is their civic duty to vote but don’t want to spend too much time learning about propositions will be able to enjoy SeePolitical’s entertaining and informative content. New U.S. citizens who don’t read English well enough to truly understand the legal jargon on each ballot will have an opportunity to watch and listen to SeePolitical’s explanations in their native tongue. The seasoned voter will also enjoy a new and refreshing take on explaining policy issues, in addition to access to links to outside content that can offer more in-depth explanations. Teachers in our classrooms will finally have a tool to help their students learn about the complex issues that their parents are voting on as well as the very process that they too will be expected to participate in as adult citizens.

    "goal": "LEARN",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "The 2050 metric is really important to us at LASA. We embrace the long-term. We work with a fairly small group of participants at a time. We are about to welcome our third LASA class (in early August). It has thirty high school juniors. We have three collegiate interns and about a half dozen teachers. That's a small footprint in terms of making a difference. But: we will soon have close to a hundred LASA students, past and present, with which to build foundational change in greater Los Angeles. Then 130, 160, 190, and so on. Even thinking of thirty-per year (we expect to expand that number) gets us to well over 1000 LASA-ites by 2050. If, in the long-term, we can establish networks of knowledge, civil and civic service and awareness, and public obligation among our graduates, we will have accomplished our highest goals. In other words, there's a scenario in our head about problem solving in LA in 2050. And the principals involved in wrestling with said problem are LASA graduates -- they've built knowledge over the years, they've established efficient networks of collegiality and collaboration, and they get down to solve infrastructural problems and puzzles with greater skill and vision because of all this.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Solo actor (just us on this project!)",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Percentage of community college students completing a certificate, degree, or transfer-related program in six years",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "We believe the content knowledge imparted by LASA is step one; step two is confidence-building about each student's place within the metropolis. We believe these fit hand in glove and will pay big educational and community dividends. We track LASA college matriculation numbers, and we are doing very well.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will track our students into colleges/universities.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "High school students are hungry to learn how to navigate and make sense of the gargantuan metropolis.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "LASA begins with questions. How does a city run? How does a vast metropolitan region like Los Angeles work? Which institutions are responsible for moving water, people, food, and power from points A to points Z? How are such institutions and agencies funded and run? Who runs them? How can neighborhoods be made more livable? What does an elected official do all day? What role do cultural institutions play in the life of greater Los Angeles? What about businesses and non-profits? What are the potential educational and career paths for young people interested in civic, civil, and public service in the Los Angeles Basin? We encourage high school students to ask these -- and so many more -- questions, and then we work together to answer them.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "LASA works annually with about 30 high school juniors from all across the Los Angeles Basin. Most of our students come from public schools and public districts; some come from private schools. We add as well about six teachers or administrators, and as many as three collegiate interns. Our design is simple. We plunge the students into a four-day summer introductory seminar that teaches them the broadest strokes of Los Angeles history and culture (issues ranging from seismic vulnerabilities to film studio history, and from city governance to immigration and demographic patterns. We do so with experts and remarkable documents from archives at The Huntington or Central Library. We build every participant's library by supplying them with key texts on LA issues and LA history.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "At the very center of the experience, we know LASA benefit four specific groups. First and foremost are the high school participants themselves. Those benefits accrue, we think, in post-LASA years, in that we make efforts to keep in touch, to track our graduates into next phases of their lives and budding careers. Second, we think the program benefits our collegiate interns. Since inception several years ago, these have been Occidental College students solely, a reflection of that college's commitment to public/civic service through the Urban and Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI). Neither of LASA's directors are affiliated with Oxy (one of us is at USC, the other at Colburn School of Music). These interns see their undergraduate training enhanced by their interaction with the city and our high schoolers. Third, we believe the teacher participants, some of whom have been with us since we started, benefit from taking their curricular interests into the city and its landscapes. They also benefit from collegial exchange with their colleagues from other institutions. Fourth, co-directors Bill Deverell and Doug Smith benefit from the opportunity to work with younger, non-collegiate students on this regular basis and get to enhance networks of collaboration throughout greater LA.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We are already a going concern. We have seed funding. We need more to keep the project going, and to expand it. We have grown each of the three years: from about 20 kids to more and now 30. We have also piloted a two-day \"LASA Junior\" project aimed at 8th graders, which is possibly expandable and a good recruitment pool to draw from for the high school effort.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "LASA thrives on and can only work through partnerships. It is in fostering these partnerships -- and in showcasing them to the students -- that we further and strengthen our foundation of collaboration across the great city. Our key institutional partners are two institutions: the Huntington Library and the Los Angeles Public Library. These are our base camps; we meet here, we use materials from here, we explore relevant issues on top of their materials and outward from them into the region. But other partnerships with individuals and their institutions are every bit as critical. Our experts drive LASA. We are proud of the relationships we have built with, for example, the Los Angeles Times (esp. architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne and transit reporter Laura Nelson); Raphael Sonenshein of Cal State LA; Rob Salzman of the Los Angeles Police Commission; Maria Cabildo of the East LA Community Corporation; Robert DeGroot of the Southern California Earthquake Center; Laurence Frank of LA Trade Tech and former mayor Villaraigosa's office; Rich Llewellyan of Mayor Garcetti's office; Ken Brecher of the Library Foundation of Los Angeles; Bernadette Glenn of the WHH Foundation; Jeff Kightlinger and Marjorie Wheeler of the Metropolitan Water District; the Port of Los Angeles and the Los Angele Harbor Commission, esp. David Arian; Deputy LAPD Chief Sandy Jo MacArthur; Steven Koblik of the Huntington Library; and others. Our network of colleagues and collaborators is expanding, and we are proud of the fact that the LASA participants get to meet high-profile decision-makers and leaders across a broad swath of institutions, agencies, and educational centers in the region.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "We have two key challenges. One is conceptual: how to expand, widen our impact, grow -- but not at the expense of the specialness and community established and sustained by our relatively small numbers year to year. We can solve this. But it will take thought and careful planning. We could add students at a regular clip -- five or so more per year. That would be growth, and it would be manageable, at least in the short term. We could run LASA wings or parallel experiences with several groups. We could offer an experiential LASA (the Saturday model) to one group and an abridged experience to a larger group (in the summer, for example). This is a good problem to have; we are at work figuring it out."

Schools are under-resourced when it comes to technology, the ability to keep it up to date and arts teachers to foster student creativity. Our production vehicle with up to date technology and gifted mentors provides a cost effective and flexible way to reach kids that often are left behind.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have been in discussion with all the relevant partners and many of the sponsors over the course of this past year. Our experience with running our existing MFC will streamline the process of determining the best way to meet the needs of the kids we serve, which equipment and software to lease or buy. To purchase, customize and equip a new eco friendly RV will only take a few months and, with the help of $100,000 from LA2050, would be ready to hit the road by Summer 2015 to serve our expanding list of clients.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Because our program challenges students to create stories around issues in their community, it will benefit all of Los Angeles. They’re not just making a fun movie, they’re making a fun movie with a message. It opens kids up to the world around them and helps them find their voice and discover ways to engage and affect change within their own communities. It also benefits foster and incarcerated teens like Ebony and Kamonie. Abandoned by her mother and shoved into foster care, Ebony hid under a hoodie. But when asked on camera what she wanted to be, she whispered “a poet.” The poem she wrote for her mom became the basis of her film, “Need You”. Ebony’s counselor said that in the month she’d worked on the bus, she’d finally begun to speak up in therapy. Through the medium of film, Ebony found her voice.",

We’ve worked with the County Library since 2011. Another ongoing partnership is with the non profit Hollywood Heart, that provides arts training to LA area at risk youth, including a Summer arts camp for teens impacted by HIV/AIDS. This August we’ll be leading our 5 documentary film workshop with them since 2012. We’ve partnered with Green Dot Public Schools, leading two workshops at their Animo South LA High School campus, The City of Los Angeles Public Library, LA’s Best, The Geena Davis Institute for Gender in Media, LACOE Juvenile Court Schools at Pacific Lodge and Camp David Gonzales, Aviva Center, LAUSD, Malibu Boys and Girls Club.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Mobilize the diverse creativity of LA’s youth with a new eco-friendly digital media bus to sustain LA as the creative capital of the world.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "A more creative LA happens when all our kids get to work on a project that is their own idea, one that they write, film and edit and see through to completion. It happens when they get positive feed back and recognition from an audience when their finished film is screened. It happens when kids realize they have something to offer. A new eco-friendly production studio-on-wheels that brings media arts instruction to at risk and under-resourced youth will help Los Angeles be the best place to create by making sure this happens in every corner of LA. As the second largest city and school system in the US, LA serves as a microcosm of the challenges faced across the country, its demographic changes represent the changing face of America. Hispanics and African Americans make up over 80% of the school age population but have the least access to the technology and skills required to thrive in a diverse and creative workforce. It’s commonplace to find in local high schools, one laptop cart with 20 computers per 600 students. In this city of over 268,000 millionaires, the entertainment capital of the world, the disparity between neighborhoods that are 15 miles south of the Hollywood sign and the ones just north, is a waste of human capital we can’t afford. LA is losing good paying creative jobs to states like Georgia, Louisiana, New York and New Mexico. Film Industry professionals and their Guilds are answering the State’s call to diversify their membership if they want to see an increase in film incentives by reaching out to programs like ours who help develop the next generation of the creative workforce. Using our up-to-date equipment and software, industry mentors encourage students to express themselves through the process of making a film. Kids engage in a way that fosters creativity and requires critical thinking, collaboration, listening, time management and creative problem-solving skills. A 2006 Ready to Work Study found 72% of employers said that creativity is the number one skill they seek when hiring. Los Angeles can be a leader and a model for a the rest of the country by investing in all our kids, no matter what their zip code, to prepare them to think creatively and to imagine things that have yet to come into existence. Our youth are our greatest resource and we need to foster their talent and celebrate the diversity their voices bring to our media landscape if we want to sustain Los Angeles as the creative media capital in 2050.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "With one bus we were able to introduce the world of technology, collaboration and storytelling to 350 kids last year. With a 2nd bus we could double that number. To do so we need to find the resources and the money to fund this $150,000 project. This would not be any ordinary bus; it would be the calling card to our organization. It would be eco-friendly, running on bio-diesel when in motion and solar-powered when stationary. Inside would be state of the art technology for our budding young filmmakers. This bus would be unique to our organization and generate excitement and interest and significantly raise our PR profile. Its environmental impact would be minimal, but our social impact would be huge.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We will work with an industry partner to purchase and retrofit an RV into an eco-friendly digital media classroom that runs on biodiesel and has a solar powered generator. This will allow us to more than double the number of kids we serve in a year and expand our geographical reach. Our programs are well tested and beyond the pilot stage so having the physical resource a new, cost effective vehicle will shift us into high gear on our mission to use this LA program as a model and incubator for digital media programs across the country.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will use pre and post surveys to measure student interest and acquisition of skills and knowledge. We will also document the process on film and conduct on camera testimonials. We track our students after they graduate and enter local community colleges. Several recent MFC students who have gone on to study film at UCLA, El Camino and Santa Monica Community Colleges have come back to us to mentor youth. We will work with local universities and also the industry guilds to track employment within the industry.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "In one year, with only one bus, the Mobile Film Classroom got 350 kids on board to learn how to work in teams to write, shoot and edit their stories using digital media. Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where every kid is the creator of their own story, no matter their gender, ethnicity or socio-economic status. To double our impact, we’ll equip a second, eco-friendly production studio-on-wheels that travels into under-resourced LA communities to serve kids who don’t have access to technology or industry mentors, to help them build the critical thinking, collaboration, listening, time management and problem solving skills that they’ll need to be the innovative leaders who will sustain Los Angeles as the creative capital of the world.",

Los Angeles can be a leader and a model for a the rest of the country by investing in all our kids, no matter what their zip code, to prepare them to think creatively and to imagine things that have yet to come into existence. Our youth are our greatest resource and we need to foster their talent and celebrate the diversity their voices bring to our media landscape if we want to sustain Los Angeles as the creative media capital in 2050."

    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Our first goal is to connect students to themselves. Through writing prompts and sharing personal stories in a supportive environment, students explore their own dreams and struggles on a deeper level. Identifying commonalities among one another breaks down perceived barriers and preconceived notions among the group, leading to the important understanding that we are all more alike than different. We deepen this idea by learning about the cultural diversity found all around Los Angeles, demystifying stereotypes and gaining appreciation for the unique qualities we all possess.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Each student will complete a comprehensive evaluation form prior to and concluding their participation in the BRIDGE project. These pre- and post-program evaluations pose questions directly related to the program goals and measure their impact on each individual student. In addition, observational assessments of individual and group progress will be recorded and reported throughout the program, by both teaching artists and administrative staff.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The biggest piece of the puzzle – our partnership with the schools – is already in place. Anticipating that all necessary funds come through, our next step will be hiring teaching artists, drawing from our pool of experienced former colleagues and, if necessary, interviewing other qualified candidates.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "BRIDGE Theatre Project began in 2009 as an international theatre program offering worldwide exchange opportunities for youth to connect through original plays. Our name, BRIDGE, is an acronym for Building Relationships and Inspiring Dialogue through Global (or Grassroots) Exchange. We have had hugely successful programs here in LA and in severely impoverished areas of Ecuador and Nepal.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Despite the myriad of diverse cultures in Los Angeles, we are surprisingly disconnected. BRIDGE Theatre Project offers an artistic means to correct this. We target the youth community, because children are the key to creating lasting change.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This BRIDGE project will benefit the Lynwood community of Los Angeles County, particularly elementary (grades 4 & 5), middle and high school youth in the Lynwood Unified School District (LUSD). The potential for expanding to other areas of LA County is very viable, with the only factors being capital and greater teaching artist support. BRIDGE programs in other LA regions are part of our strategic plan over the next 2-3 years.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Lynwood Unified School District is a confirmed collaborator on this project. BRIDGE was approached by LUSD’s Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services to implement this program in all 18 schools within the district. It will mark our first collaboration with LUSD.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Connect and unite diverse LA youth through collaborative playwriting & performance workshops, generating actions to address local problems.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "South LA",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Rates of volunteerism & Percentage volunteering informally:",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The primary lesson that drives our work with BRIDGE Theatre Project is that we are more alike than different. It wasn’t until our first international program in Ecuador where this became truly evident. The children we worked with lived in a very poor area – their homes and classrooms were small shacks, many with faulty construction and no electricity. Though at the onset we appeared to have little in common with the students there, after working together and engaging in dialogue about our personal struggles and problems in the greater world, we discovered far more similarities than differences. This theme has continued to follow us, motivate and enlighten us. Returning to Los Angeles, where we began our program with a small group of students, we showed the local youth participants how their work was received in Ecuador. They, too, discovered they had a great deal in common. One LA student, Lucy, nailed in on the head when she said, “We’re really not that different from each other at all.” Later, while conducting our program in Kathmandu, Nepal, students there made the same observations: “They’re just like us!” Indeed, this valuable lesson continues to inform and inspire our work with BRIDGE.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Though we have a strong working relationship with Lynwood Unified’s Assistant Superintendent and we are confirmed to begin programming throughout their district, we are a new partner and have yet to establish personal connections with each of the individual school staff and students. This is one reason why we cannot realistically expect to execute the majority of our programs until early-2015. We will address this challenge with pre-program meetings with schoolteachers and administrative staff, as well as heavy recruitment efforts to ensure we have at least 25 students participating at each school site. Our teaching artists and volunteers will be instrumental in helping us establish these initial connections.",

Second, PortTech vets entrepreneurs to find qualified candidates. Through dedicated one-on-one mentoring, we then begin the process of transforming these startup teams into thriving businesses. By helping them take root and grow in the Harbor area, we’re creating jobs and helping to rebuild Los Angeles’ port communities one business at a time.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "In 2009, the business and community leaders of San Pedro and Wilmington envisioned a future where creative entrepreneurs would solve major environmental challenges facing port communities while at the same time create living-wage “green collar” jobs for area residents. The path to realizing that vision began with PortTech.",

What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Challenge 1: everybody dance! is working to increase enrollment at its new after-school program site, Ramón C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts, where we began offering classes in October 2013. We expected to have 15-20 students per class, but currently have an average of nine per class. This low number is likely due to the fact that these classes are limited to high school students and that the program began two months after school started, when students’ schedules were already set. The start of everybody dance! classes will coincide with the start of the school year in the 2014-2015 school year.",

Additionally, young people, 12 to 19 years old, experience the highest rates of rape and sexual assault (U.S. Department of Justice-2009). Experiencing teen dating violence and sexual assault has severe consequences for youth; these forms of violence are associated with higher levels of substance abuse, violence, victimization, as well as lower school achievement. Dating violence victims present a strong, consistent pattern of exposure to, and participation in, a broad range of high-risk behaviors, including eating disorders, sexual risk behavior, pregnancy, and suicidal ideation.

    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Los Angeles County healthcare system is an essential public service available to all residents and visitors. Whether or not a specific individual is using that system at any given point in time, everyone in LA can benefit from that public good. While our thoughts go first to the ill or injured who currently require hospital care, everyone in LA knows that the emergency medical services, emergency rooms, and world class healthcare in general are available to them and their families, if needed. Whether directly or indirectly, all of us benefit from our healthcare system. A well functioning healthcare system is essential to a vibrant, resilient community that can continue to thrive. In the new century, a comprehensive, long-term approach to healthcare cybersecurity is essential to the reliability and public trust of the healthcare system.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Healthcare access",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Within 12 months of receiving funding, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will have completed most of the first two phases of its plan, and the third phase will be underway. The planning phase consists of securing appropriate permissions from hospitals and healthcare professionals for participation. We have already begun this process by approaching top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations for buy-in. The planning phase also includes designing questionnaires and interview guides; the formative work for this activity is already complete.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Challenge 1: Some healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers may be reluctant to participate. In many cases, these individuals are generally aware of such cybersecurity concerns (or perceptions), but do not want the issue examined in detail by an outsider to the hospital or hospital organization. They may not want attention placed on their institution’s weaknesses.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Nearly all LA County’ hospitals have moved to electronic health records (EHR) in compliance with Federal regulations. We have identified a mismatch regarding perceived versus actual vulnerabilities to these medical records. According to cybersecurity experts, electronic systems are much more vulnerable than we realize, which places LA County residents at great risk. The next “Cyber Pearl Harbor” may be just around the corner. Our initiative will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of digital healthcare information in LA’s hospitals. The differences between cyber threat perceptions and actual vulnerabilities will be collected and analyzed to improve the security of LA County’s EHRs, thus making our population healthier and safer.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the cybersecurity threats. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every individual who uses LA County’s hospitals.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Hospital Association of Southern California",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our healthcare is undergoing a rapid transition. New laws are changing the way we provide care, healthcare costs are still out of control, providers are changing how they interact with patients, public health is underfunded, hospital profit margins are reduced, and all medical records are being digitized. This “perfect storm” helps put the importance of proper cyber safeguards in a broader context.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Metric 1 (process): Participation of healthcare technology buyers, users, managers, administrators, and compliance officers in the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. To be most effective, we will require the buy-in and support of these individuals to properly assess cybersecurity concerns. The support of both top-level administrators and hospital/healthcare associations will help with this endeavor, and we have already gained some support from them for the initiative. We will certainly be successful with even moderate participation from healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers, but we seek to maximize their participation.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Lesson 1: In our experience many healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers are either unaware of or do not fully appreciate the cybersecurity risks to healthcare data. This lesson is based on consultation with cybersecurity professionals, the literature, and anecdotal information regarding the perceptions of healthcare professionals. This lesson, as well as the desire to have a resilient, robust system in place, is what prompted the need for the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. The extent and scope of the mismatch between cybersecurity and healthcare professionals will be determined and analyzed. Furthermore, many healthcare professionals are reluctant to participate in this type of research because it shines a light on a sensitive issue that they do not fully understand nor want to make public. In other words, they may not want to share their concerns. This is why buy-in and active support from top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations is critical.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "COMMET promotes the widespread use of new medical technology, bridging the gap between medicine and technology.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The Cyber Insecurity Initiative has four main phases: planning, assessment, analysis, and recommendations. The planning phase will consist of securing appropriate permissions from LA County’s 122 licensed hospitals for participation, designing questionnaires and interview guides to conduct the vulnerability assessments, and coordinating the logistics to carry out the plan. There may be reluctance to have participants do an Internet survey, so we will do both a person-to-person as well as a text survey (using text to database technology we developed). All information will be confidential and not attributed to any one hospital. Only combined data will be shown in any report. The assessment phase involves scheduling and conducting interviews with five groups that have input. Special emphasis will be placed on achieving a balance of each hospital’s EHR buyers, users, emergency managers, administrators, and compliance officers. The questionnaires and interviews will provide the foundation of the vulnerability assessment, complemented by subject matter expert evaluations. The analysis phase requires thorough statistical analysis of all data. One key goal is to compare and evaluate vulnerability perceptions (as documented in the questionnaires and interviews) with actual vulnerabilities (as documented by cybersecurity professionals working with us as well as the literature). The recommendations phase begins with preparing reports and presentation materials, culminating with the presentation of findings with recommendations to improve cybersecurity to the entire hospital community. Specific collaborators for the initiative’s findings and recommendations are the Hospital Association of Southern California, the Hospital Corporation of America (pending), the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, the LA County EMS Agency, Red-E Consulting, and the California Hospital Association."

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Success will be measured by each event's attendance, social media interaction, surveying, media, and other digital artifacts captured through each event, and a high level of participation and involvement of local places of worship.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Proposed collaboration (we want to work with partners!)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "This project will unite Los Angeles around faith, rather than divide it. Most of the world, especially the Middle East and the continent of Africa, is increasingly at war because of religious belief. As the most religiously diverse city on the face of the earth, Los Angeles has the privilege and opportunity to show the broad spectrum of faith expressions. Every human asks questions about the existence of God - but we all express this question differently. Using geographic location and different mediums, we open up the question to individual expression rather than suppress it, ignore it, or belittle it. The center of all religion is truth and love. It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties help to embolden the conversation and expression of faith in Los Angeles for the purpose of serving others and promoting universal good.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The Founder of Holy Ghost Global is a member of the Interfaith Religious Council's Future50, a select number of Los Angeles' top faith leaders. This organization is committed to promoting peace and harmony across faiths in Los Angeles and have pledged to support any project that members of the Future50 cohort implement. There has been a collaboration with the USC Office of Religious Life for several years for Holy Ghost Global projects and they are a wonderful flag-bearer for relevant, faith-based expression. As the largest private employer in Los Angeles, having USC involved offers an unprecedented reach across the Los Angeles community. Because many of its faculty and student body are proclaimers of faith, they are a wonderful symbol for the power of faith to do good in our city and across the world. The New Theological Seminary of the West, the newest Christian seminary in Los Angeles, is a great partner for unifying and mobilizing the Los Angeles Christian community. Because they are less traditional in structure, they afford the ability to connect with houses of faith. American Jewish University is another potential supporter along with dozens of places of worship across Los Angeles.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 PLAY metrics?": "Access to open space and park facilities",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One major barrier/challenge to the Interfaith Block Parties are competition with other events in certain communities on weekends. The key to overcoming this barrier would be communication and logistical work done with local faith-based organizations to coordinate the best possible dates ahead of time that do not conflict with existing events. A massive on-line calendar - infrastructure that could outlive the events and continue existing to keep interfaith dialogue, relationships, and planning alive in Los Angeles - would ensure that schedules are not in conflict and everyone knows when and where the events are happening.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties will most benefit Angelenos of faith in the specific communities where each event will be held (Santa Monica, San Pedro, Hollywood, Echo Park, USC). However, the benefit does not end there. Having these events will have a ripple effect that will empower other local communities to have similar events.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "A series of interfaith block parties that bring together the Los Angeles faith community in celebration of our similarities and differences",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Partnering with the Interfaith Religious Council of Los Angeles, the Office of Religious Life at USC, and local places of worship across Los Angeles, each event will require a diverse body of actors to plan it, promote it, and execute it. In highlighting the spiritual elements of each community it is in, It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties will be family friendly opportunities to come together, be educated, dance, have a great time, and celebrate religious diversity and pluralism of Los Angeles. The intention behind each event will be to mobilize community service across faith-lines in that community, as well as educate the local community about different expressions of faith and worship. For instance, the Hollywood event would enable a Christian church like Mosaic, the Self-Realization Fellowship, Temple of Israel Hollywood, and other places of faith to have a common purpose and learn from one another. Holy Ghost Global has experience executing such events in unique venues like the Burning Man Art Festival, South by Southwest in Austin, on the Venice Beach Boardwalk, and other places.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Putting these five events on in the next twelve months is absolutely possible. Spacing each event out beginning in the Fall, there could be one event every three months, with the National Day of Prayer event held between the third and fourth event.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The interfaith block parties will almost exclusively take place in public parks and open spaces in Los Angeles. Each event will be family friendly and will connect with students, teachers, and faculty of local schools. Since Holy Ghost Global is involved in prison chaplaincy and ministry, it has found that the majority of convicted offenders are people of faith. Some have been ostracized or disconnected from their faith communities which has made them more at risk for incarceration. These events would help connect attendees to places of faith in their community, strengthening these days and effectively reducing crime and incarceration rates. Some of the speakers and musicians at the events would be former convicts and could speak to issues of social justice and progress.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The two lessons that have most informed this project come from the Holy Ghost Global team's ministry experience in Los Angeles. Whether it has been praise and worship internships with Houses of Prayer in Pasadena, Chaplaincy work in LA County prisons and the V.A. Hospital, church planting in Inglewood, healing classes with churches in Wilmington, feeding the homeless with the Dream Center in Echo Park, or music, street outreach, and Bible studies in Hollywood, there is a starvation for authentic spiritual practice in Los Angeles.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties would take place across one year in the four quarters of Los Angeles: Santa Monica, (Healing), (Education/Service), East Side (Arts), and North Side (Media/Technology) and on campus at USC on May 7th, 2015. Each event would highlight the cultural, economic, and religious diversity of each section through an interactive music-based event and community service project. The first would be held in Santa Monica and focus on healing through a Healing Arts Fair near the Santa Monica pier including yoga studios and practitioners, spiritual healing practices, medical facilities, the VA hospital, and local churches, synagogues and faith-based recovery centers and programs."

    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "UFC's College Readiness Program supports foster children from grades 7-12 so they graduate from high school and move on to college careers.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Central to UFC’s approach is providing the foster youth in our programs with long-term relationships with UFC staff members, who serve as the source of consistent support that many foster youth lack in their lives. Counselors act as mentors and advisors to each student, and also encourage the youth to advocate for themselves. This support extends to caregivers as well, who benefit from workshops and activities focused on creating a college-bound atmosphere in their home.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "Almost one seventh of the 400,000 children in foster care in the US reside in the state of California, and one third of those are in Los Angeles County (AFCARS and CCWIP, 2012). Over 8,000 of the 18,700 children in care in Los Angeles County are between the ages of 11 and 21 (CCWIP, 2012), and it is these children and youth whose futures UFC seeks to improve through its programs. Compared with their peers in the general population, foster youth experience poor outcomes in a number of areas of their life. When foster youth leave care, they are on their own with little to no support system to help them navigate the difficult path to adulthood. The informal safety net built by familial bonds that so many of us take for granted does not exist for many former foster youth. There is no grace period and no safe place to return when things do not go as planned. As a result, foster youth are perhaps one of the most vulnerable populations in our communities. The statistics, especially those related to educational attainment, show that the majority of Los Angeles County foster youth exiting care will not become successfully independent as adults:",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The most important lesson that UFC has learned over more than 30 years service to foster youth in our community is that stable, consistent, long-term relationships are key to successful outcomes.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The College Readiness program supports students over a six-year period, from seventh through 12th grades. Through one-on-one support and a variety of workshops and other activities, participation in the program helps students to complete their high-school degree,graduate four year college eligible, and apply to college.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Youth unemployment and underemployment",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The goal of the CRP is to help foster youth graduate from high school four-year college eligible. UFC’s Education programs have clear quantitative goals, against which progress is continually measured. Target outcomes for the College Readiness Program include the following:",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "UFC's College Readiness program has been in operation since 2003, and has experienced steady growth and consistently successful outcomes since that time. It is based on this history that we are confident in the program's continuing operation and success in the coming year.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Certainly we hope that no significant barriers to successful implementation will arise, while we prepare for any number of potential problems. In early 2014, for example, we noted that new student enrollment in the program was not at a pace to allow us to reach our goal for number of students served. We addressed the issue by increasing our outreach efforts, simplifying the application process, and other measures that resulted in significantly improved recruitment numbers in the second half of the 2013-2014 year, allowing us to reach our target service numbers. Always, we like all nonprofit organizations face resource challenges which, as noted below, we are addressing by intensifying our search for new sources of funding and by diversifying our fundraising initiatives.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "UFC's programs serve foster youth throughout Los Angeles County. We currently serve approximately 1,300 foster children and youth annually, including 500 individuals in the Readiness program. The CRP is open to any student in Los Angeles County foster care interested in taking advantage of the services UFC has to offer and is not enrolled in a Special Day Class. New students are recruited in grades seven through nine to ensure the possibility of at least four years of participation. Students are referred by DCFS social workers, advocates, partner schools, or siblings of CRP students.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "One of UFC’s greatest strengths is our partnerships and service linkage with other organizations. Due to the frequency and intimacy of our contact with youth we serve and when applicable, their caregivers, UFC is in a unique position to assess the particular gaps in services and/or needs of individual foster youth. The College Readiness program works with many partners, including the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), UCLA Connecting Communities, Coalition for Engaged Education’s Forward Program, CASA, iFoster, LACOE Foster Youth Services, Public Counsel, Green Dot, SoCalCAN, Education Coordinating Council, Court Scholars, L.A. Compact, Children’s Law Center, Success in Degrees, Camp Felix, First Star UCLA Bruin Guardian Academy, Alliance for Children’s Rights, and numerous Foster Family Agencies and Group Homes.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The principal goals of the program are to improve high school graduation rates among foster youth (from an average of less than 50% within their peer group to a goal of 100% of four-year program participants) and four-year college enrollment (from less than 15% among their peers to more than 50% of program participants). The other goals identified above are inevitable outcomes of participation, whether they be measures of student performance during their High School years, or long-term chances of achieving employment after.",

We plan to expand and leverage our local and national partnerships with community anchor institutions, volunteer organizations and nonprofits to drive awareness around the project and its incentives for volunteers and donors of unwanted technology.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "EveryoneOn will leverage our existing platform of low-cost offers to provide Internet service and computers. The funds received for this grant will provide free routers and low-cost home Internet service (valued at $10/month). We will partner with human-I-T staff and volunteers to provide donated, refurbished computers with customized software that includes digital literacy content and Windows 7 Professional.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "The detrimental effects of illiteracy are often compounded because of a lack of resources, geographic isolation, or underdeveloped education programs. Many schools and educational institutions lack the resources and materials for comprehensive literacy programs, and library systems and many teachers are under-trained. As a result, the children of low- to non-literate parents are at risk of growing up illiterate, without ever having the opportunity to develop an appreciation for reading. A report released by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development found that “a mother’s reading skill is the greatest determinant of her children’s future academic success, outweighing other factors such as neighborhood and family income.”",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Percentage of children enrolled in early education programs",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Through quantitative and qualitative surveys, analytics on data usage, and longitudinal studies of test and control groups, we will measure the long-term impact of digital inclusion on our beneficiaries against the following key metrics:",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Technology has changed the way we do business, pursue education, find jobs, and interact with everyone from our family to our doctor to our members of Congress. Yet close to 1 in 5 U.S. residents do not use the Internet. Disproportionately from low-income and minority communities, these populations risk becoming increasingly isolated from our digital society because they lack access to the Internet and the skills necessary to use it effectively.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "We're working with Centro Latino and human-I-T to provide free computers, Internet service and literacy courses for low/non-literate adults.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This is an opportunity for working age adults; a vast majority of whom are parents, who have never had any formal primary schooling. One third of Centro Latino students are indigenous speakers with Spanish as their second language. The ultimate goal of these students is to learn English. We want to encourage them and their children to value and retain their primary and secondary languages as they learn English. Recent research has shown both the health and economic value of having multilingual skills.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Our partners Centro Latino for Literacy and Human-I-T are confirmed partners for this pilot project. Since 1991, Centro Latino for Literacy has been putting non-to-low literate adults on the pathway to learning English as a second language (ESL) through its unique and innovative courses. Centro Latino’s approach builds the foundational skills and confidence needed for native Spanish speakers to learn English and pursue greater educational and income opportunities.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By equipping parents and volunteers with reading comprehension and digital literacy skills, as well as home Internet access, we plan to improve education and employment outcomes for graduates and volunteers, as well as their families.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "EveryoneOn is seeking support for a pilot program in LA that will reward 200 non-literate Spanish-speaking adults who complete Centro Latino's Pre-English as a Second Language (ESL) literacy courses with a free refurbished computer preloaded with basic digital literacy content; free online and classroom-instructed literacy courses, and one year of free home broadband Internet service and equipment.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "By leveraging EveryoneOn’s existing platform of low-cost home Internet offers, new and existing programs provided by our partners at Centro Latino for Literacy and human-I-T, as well as our collective reach in LA, we are positioned to begin implementation of this project immediately."

We will assess project progress by how well we are able to meet the following performance standards within the proposed timeline: the degree to which sustainable design elements are used; the number of community members who engage in the development process; and the number of people who use the alley. Post-occupancy evaluation will include observations and interviews with residents to determine how the elements are perceived and influence the neighborhood’s health, safety, and quality of life. Additional ways we will evaluate the project is the stormwater monitoring activities. The monitoring activities will document pre and post project water quality outcomes to provide data reference for future LID alley retrofit projects in South Los Angeles.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Avalon Green Alley Demonstration Project will create a new community green space by transforming a polluted, unsafe, and underutilized alleyway in South Los Angeles into a walkable, bikeable, safe, green alley featuring innovative stormwater best management practices (BMPs). The project will take place on a 12,000-square-foot public right-of-way “T-alley,” comprised of two sections, each 400 feet long and 15 feet wide, located on a thirty-seven-acre block in a dense and severely economically disadvantaged neighborhood in South Los Angeles. The project will serve as a demonstration project—as the first in a series of alleys—for the planned Avalon Green Alley Network, which aims to retrofit nearly a mile of alleys in the neighborhood.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The Avalon Green Alley Network Demonstration Project is leading efforts to green the nearly 900 linear miles of alleys in the City of Los Angeles. These largely overlooked spaces represent nearly 2,400 acres of potentially open space. Project goals include demonstrating innovative and cost-effective means to improving water quality, contributing to the restoration of local ecosystems through the improvement of water quality and conservation of water resources, facilitating investment in green infrastructure through the development, implementation, and testing of new methods for urban greening, and engaging local residents in the design and development of new green spaces within their community.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "TPL has facilitated nearly 30 community meetings, platicas and clean-ups since April 2010. Through these meetings, planning events, and alley clean-up activities, the project has engaged the support of the following groups:",

We still do this, but Droplabs has grown beyond that in many ways.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The initial impulse to create Droplabs came about because learning open source technologies is challenging. Often documentation lags behind the technology so that you need to learn a new way of learning that isn’t taught in school and involves learning from a community of people. It turns out that the techniques that apply in this situation are also good for learning other things too.",

Los Angeles is the destination city for media production and because of this our media lab will contribute to creating a more empowered and skilled workforce in LA.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Our biggest barriers are space and money. We need funding to rent and outfit a space to better serve the community. In order to account for our lack of a consolidated space, we’ve had to host events in site specific places. While this has been good, we think that a permanent space would allow us a broader range of programming as well as allowing us to be able to realize our specific vision. We’ve been able to hold fundraisers for past projects and events.

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Participants in the first year",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Having a public community station is important. When we lived in Portland we saw the impact that it had in the community there. Whether talking about social issues or making creative videos the media center provide a hub for people of all class, viewpoint, ethnicity, religion, and aesthetic.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We currently have a three camera mobile HD TV studio, however we lack a permanent home and studio to be based out of. With the monetary support from the LA 2050 Goals grant we will be able to secure a location immediately, build out the space, and start planning the public programming for the year.

As an Alliance, one of our strongest mechanisms of service delivery is our ability to convene, but we know from experience that meeting times and meeting location contribute significantly to turnout. As such, we will need to be open to a longer lead time and having multiple meetings in a variety of locations to ensure the widest possible participation. Additionally, our work on the diversity, inclusion and access aspect of the initiative might lead to charged conversations.

We’ll activate the 1000+ arts organizations we currently serve and develop this initiative with our local, regional and national partner organizations who work in this connectivity-collaboration space, including the LA Chamber of Commerce, Arts for LA, municipal cultural agencies, arts funders, service providers and others. We will also leverage individuals serving on cultural boards and the networks of philanthropists and business leaders who support the cultural life of Los Angeles. We have strong relationships with national partners who have encouraged us to pursue this Initiative including both Americans for the Arts (their network of Arts & Business Councils, Business Committees for the Arts and United Arts Funds) and National Arts Strategies, which develops non-profit arts leaders. As previously mentioned, we have confirmed with the staff of Arts for LA that, if funded, we would contract with them to provide advocacy training over a six-month period with our Board Network.",

Specifically, our project will directly improve the lives of artists, volunteers and arts administrators by fortifying their foundation of support within the communities they serve.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our Arts Census tracks the arts participation behavior of over 4 million unique households. We can track, over time, an increase in participation and impact by zip code and neighborhood. We anticipate, for example, that the Arts Census might highlight typically “underserved” areas and populations, therefore enabling the Board network to better assess where arts programming could be delivered. We acknowledge a field-wide shift toward questions around definitions of arts engagement and suspect that our core constituents, those who produce and present performing arts events, will broaden their focus to create active arts experiences with their stakeholders. The Arts Census tracks transactional data, not “survey” responses and therefore will provide a valuable tool in tracking increasing participation and engagement in the sector.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "We know from direct experience and conversation with arts non-profit board members that there exists little to no training for joining arts boards and no formal network for board members to exchange ideas, learn from peers or mentor newcomers. We have researched existing infrastructure and similar programs throughout the country and will bring industry best practices to our initiative.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Our Arts & Culture Infrastructure Initiative will strengthen the region’s environment for art making by developing strong, diverse board leadership and cultivating new philanthropic support for non-profit arts organizations, ensuring broader access to arts experiences. Our Arts and Business conduit will galvanize business leaders in support of the arts community through leadership and advocacy training, networking, and mentorship. Our pilot region-wide Arts Fund will focus on the feasibility and development of a re-granting program similar to a “United Way” for the arts with the Alliance raising money in support of our region’s arts organizations from new individual or institutional donors, creating new money flowing into the sector."

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Vision Zero Los Angeles is informed by political and strategy lessons that the project partners have learned from years of working on street safety issues. The first lesson is that, while attention to complete streets and walking and cycling have increased in the Los Angeles area in recent years, a framework is needed to link these improvements together in a coherent program to prioritize safer streets. Even though many local jurisdictions are improving their streets, the unacceptably high rate of deaths from vehicles and lack of priority given to deaths and injuries, especially of pedestrians and cyclists, by law enforcement agencies and elected officials suggests that road safety needs a vision to bring together agencies, efforts and indicators. Vision Zero provides an easy-to-understand, comprehensive framework for reducing deaths and injuries.",

Each of these organizations and initiatives have partnered with ADL to make the anti-bullying programs successful and bring a wide variety of perspectives and resources to augment ADL’s anti-bullying work. ADL’s office in Los Angeles is ready to engage these partnerships to ensure the success of our anti-bullying work in the region.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Suspension and expulsion rates (Dream Metric)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "ADL would like to bring its anti-bullying programs, Becoming An Ally, to 30 underserved schools across Los Angeles County.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "ADL can train up to 1,200 educators and school staff at 30 trainings across the County over the next year. Assuming each teaches 100 students per year, those 1,200 school staff will then use the skills acquired through their training to positively impact the lives of more than 120,000 students each year. The Becoming An Ally program is tailored for elementary, middle and high school educators and staff. K-12 students will benefit from their educators being trained through the project. They in turn will shift social norms regionally related to bullying and pass those values onto people younger than them as well as future generations. The primary beneficiaries (1200 staff members) will help secondary beneficiaries (120,000 students) shift social norms and create safer places for many thousands of future students, the tertiary beneficiaries. Further, all of the County’s residents will benefit from safer schools and communities.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "Today, far too many students in Los Angeles are dropping out of school, skipping school, and engaging in anti-social activities because they are targeted in school by bullying, violence and bias-related behavior. According to 2011 data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 15 percent of Los Angeles students report that they have been bullied on school property while 29 percent report being in one or more physical fights in the last year. More than 12 percent report being the target of electronic and cyberbullying. Even worse, students in Los Angeles are significantly more likely to report a recent suicide attempt than students in other areas across the United States.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Ample research has shown that when students do not feel safe at school, they are more likely to be truant. Skipping school dramatically increases students’ chances of suspensions and expulsions, and reduces their academic achievement. Bullying and bias-related aggressive behaviors make students feel unsafe at and on their way to school. The rise of cyberbullying has made students feel unsafe and vulnerable in their own homes. Bullying no longer stops at the schoolyard gates. Bullying behaviors peak in and around middle school. Anti-bullying programs reduce truancy rates at the elementary and middle school levels and increase students’ perceived sense of safety at school, on the way to school and at home. Students leave ADL’s anti-bullying programs better equipped to respond to bullying, to create positive school cultures and to feel safer.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "ADL’s A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE® contracts with over two dozen facilitators who can implement Becoming An Ally at 30 schools across Los Angeles should the project be funded. ADL already coordinates Becoming An Ally and other anti-bias and anti-bullying programs across the region and has the existing staff, technological and coordination infrastructure to begin programming (and transforming Los Angeles) immediately. ADL and its partners have waiting lists of schools that would like programs but are unable to pay for them. No time will be required to engage in strategic planning, program build up or outreach.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "California public schools have substantial standardized testing requirements which can make scheduling trainings at specific times of year (e.g. the late spring) difficult. ADL will conduct the bulk of the school staff training programs in the fall, winter and just before students return to school in the late summer to avoid scheduling conflicts.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "ADL will rely on publicly available data on suspensions and expulsions from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and other large districts serving students in our metropolitan area. These same data will also provide insight into truancy rates among elementary and middle school students.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Anti-Defamation League (ADL)’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office would like to bring its anti-bullying programs, Becoming An Ally, to 30 underserved schools across Los Angeles County. The programs will create a greater sense of safety at and on the way to school, reduce truancy rates and increase attendance. Through its award winning A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE® Institute, ADL will offer 30 schools the opportunity to train up to 40 staff on our best practices for preventing, recognizing, intervening and addressing bullying among students. Our extensive research indicates that bias and prejudice are behind much of the bullying that occurs. Our anti-bias lens addresses racism, homophobia, classism, religious bigotry and other forms of bias.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "ADL contracts with over two dozen facilitators to provide training to interested schools in the Los Angeles area. They have been trained to ensure top quality programming and fidelity to the program models. The facilitators are overseen by ADL’s full-time Project Director for its A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE® Institute who handles all coordination and logistics for educational programming in the region. The Project Director is assisted locally by an administrative assistant and supported more broadly by ADL’s national Education Division and its network of 28 regional offices across the United States. All facilitators must go through an extensive background and security check prior to being issued a contract to facilitate in ADL’s A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE® Institute. Facilitators must renew contracts on an annual basis. All Becoming An Ally programs are guided by two facilitators who model the importance of an anti-bias approach to preventing and addressing bullying.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "ADL approaches anti-bullying efforts with an anti-bias lens because we know that the majority of bullying and other aggressive behaviors are rooted in forms of bias like racism, homophobia, religious bigotry, classism and others. ADL’s anti-bias educational programs from its A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE® Institute form much of the foundation for its anti-bullying programs including Becoming An Ally."

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "We aim to create a free bilingual location aware app targeted to, but not exclusively for Latin@s. This digital platform will seek to strengthen existing networks through the reciprocal exchanges and flows of goods, ideas, stories, and expressions. It will feature a marketplace to support Latin@ entrepreneurial and marginal workers so they may sell and barter their products and services. It will also feature a classifieds function to support, among other endeavors, the advertisement of relevant information such as: services, job listings, events, fundraisers, trades etc. By harnessing the expansive reach and networking impetus of mobile information technology we hope to support the socio-economic advancement and overall well-being of Latin",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will first evaluate the functionality of the app itself. By conducting a series of focus groups based around our own and partner constituents use of the app itself and its effectiveness of addressing and meeting their needs. Second we will have set metrics to meet for the user acquisition once the app is launched. The funding for this project in the first year will set the foundation for the long term life of the app and project.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The first major barrier we anticipate is acquiring enough users to have a significant impact. In order to remedy this we will launch a massive outreach effort. We will make use of our relationships with Spanish language media partners to introduce and encourage usage of the app. We will also make use of our network and relationships with other organizations and community groups across the county. In partnership with our extensive network we will actively engage one on one with our targeted audience. Presentations and workshops on the usage of the app will be conducted to capacitate interested users.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementing this project in the next twelve months will be achievable with funding from the LA250 grants challenge. With funding in place we’ll have the necessary capital to finance the development of the app and to hire a project manager. A project manager has already been assigned to oversee the process and has begun some preliminary research work.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Our development partner is Arroyo Labs, www.arroyolabs.com. They have worked with companies such as peet's cofee and k-swiss among others. They will be providing the technical leadership and expertise on the project. They will be implementing and maintaining the technology that drives the marketplace.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We will implement this project in three phases. The first phase is our research and discovery stage. In this phase we will work with our partners to refine the concept and design of our app. We will also solicit feedback from the community. The second phase is development. Here our tech partner will build the app. The third phase is the release, where we will begin to roll out the app to the community and work with our media partners to get the word out.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This project can benefit anybody but it’s particularly intended for Los Angeles County’s Latin@ marginal workers. In a 2005 Economic Roundtable study, Los Angeles County’s informal labor force has a low estimate of 322,400 to a high of 972,500. They are independent and self-sufficient. They are not necessarily tied to a particular industry but often make use of social networks and kinship ties for work. They are “millennials” and older folks. Some only speak Spanish while others are bilingual or speak only English. They are citizens and the undocumented. Some lack formal employment but are still generating income through various activities in the informal economy. These folks are domestic workers and day laborers. They include women setting up pop-up taco shops and pupuserias on San Fernando Valley sidewalks to men selling leather belts down central LA streets. They are seamstresses who offer clothing alterations from home and the countless mechanics fixing cars wherever they stand. They include the senoras and senores selling tamales in front of supermarkets; sobadoras and sobadores straightening out backs in shacks. This project will also benefit Latin@ artists wanting to make available their paintings, prints, buttons, books, CDs, videos, films, and other works of art for purchase. Or musicians such as mariachis and DJ’s looking to advertise their services, including young hip hop heads, punks, and bandas. Tiangius is a cause, linking and sharing creative ideas, products, new media, and stories.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By providing the support for entrepreneurially inclined Latin@s in the informal economy our project will assist in the transition to and creation of minority-owned formal businesses. This project will disproportionately benefit Latina women as they index higher in such independent and often marginal work. Thus this project will also help increase minority women owned businesses.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Working directly with the Latin@ community, Tia Chucha’s Centro Cultural has come to learn and experience first-hand the degree of invisibility cast onto Latin@s within the wider common imagination. Often this abyss is filled with images and notions mangled by mass media and tainted by the ever present undertones of race politics. An associated affect of this unfortunate reality, among others, is a blind disregard for the many contributions and the great potentiality of the U.S.’s largest language minority. It is only recently that society at large is taking notice of this influential presence. Driving this awareness are large corporations casting Latin@s as the next viable market to profit from. More than just a Latin@s are stake holders and contributors to the future of Los Angeles. Los Angeles can’t become the great place hoped for unless we expand the idiom of pulling yourself up from your bootstraps to include the great African proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.”",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "As the largest demographic and drivers of new business growth, the success of Latin@s is paramount to ensuring Los Angeles County is the best place to create today and in 2050. Despite this favorable trend there are innumerable obstacles deterring Latin@ advancement such as high unemployment rates among others. For those finding relief within the informal economy creation is an indispensable necessity for survival. By placing language accessible technological tools & resources at a finger’s touch our project will serve to support current entrepreneurial activity and stimulate future formal business ownership.",

This improves access to open space and park facilities, and increases the number of Los Angeles residents who live within a ¼ mile of a vibrant park. Through our arts programming, some of which are for youth, we will increase the number of children enrolled in aftershool programs. Many of our programs are for seniors, which in conjunction with our youth programming, increases opportunities for intergenerational play. Above all, the Arts Commons makes literature, theater, music, and public art an accessible part of Los Angeles’ recreational spaces.",

M3TNT has a unique ability to bring people to view public transportation as a familiar and even pleasurable means of transportation as well as holding the potential to increase ridership among the artistic community and art attendance among the transit using community. A potential long-term effect of this brand of art is that people will decide to return to some of the communities they visited for the first time during our show, this may even provide some of the more economically depressed areas along our shows route to experience added income. One strategy we will employ to facilitate this is to have merchants along the Gold line offer discount coupons to any M3TNT audience members who return to the neighborhood to shop or eat within a month of the production. A transit-oriented project like this can also go a long way to providing a “hip factor” to public transportation amongst an art going public that like, Los Angeles as a whole, is car-centric.",

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The lesson that has most informed M3TNT is that of isolationism’s corrosive effect in Los Angeles, isolation between residents, cultures and even arts organizations, which negatively affects economic growth, multicultural cohesion and artistic progress throughout the city. This challenge was identified in a discussions with CoA’s community, audience members, artists and arts practitioners throughout Los Angeles, revealing that while many of our youth today do not go beyond a 10 mile radius of their community, many greater LA residents do yearn to interact with people outside their community. Naturally, this segregation limits a community’s economic potential. Moreover, while LA remains one of the most diverse cities on the planet, many communities exist in isolation, and opportunities for interaction between ethnicities are limited. Unfortunately, many local theatres reflect this isolation, often producing art in silos in close proximity to one another with similar missions for similar audiences without collaborating, which stymies artistic creativity and advancement. M3TNT works to address these issues by developing an experience that encourages positive interactions between LA residents from different regions and diverse ethnicities through LA’s central Metro system, taking audiences out of their isolated communities and into other parts of the city. Furthermore, by collaborating with other local artists and theatre companies, musical bands, arts organizations and solo performers from throughout LA, M3TNT spurs artistic awareness and progress while exposing audiences to art they might otherwise not have the opportunity to experience. This project’s unique mobility, participatory style, collaborative nature and grandiose scale have a positive impact on the progression of Los Angeles as a city that cares for all its residents regardless of geography or economic status.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "M3TNT is a community based arts project performed on the Metro Gold line. It is the most innovative transit-oriented “Happening” in Los Angeles, featuring music, dance, theatre and puppets along the various stops between Union Station and Memorial Park. The production seeks to connect people to areas they would not otherwise go and to offer an alternative to sometimes inaccessible and expensive art venues.

    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Overview of Project Timeline:",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The work to make M3TNT a reality has already begun and though there is still much to do we are on pace to a successful opening. To date we have identified and secured a core group of theatre artists to consult and collaborate on the project including Guillermo Aviles-Rodriguez the creator of Meet Me @Metro and an authority on transit-oriented performances in Los Angeles. In March of 2014 we reached out to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and started the negotiations with Diane Dominguez, Senior Real Estate Officer at Metro for the use of selected stops along the Gold line, including Union Station, China Town, Highland Park, Mission, Del Mar, and Memorial Park. We have also reached out to the Metro Art Docent Council to secure metro volunteers during our performances. We will also begin strategic outreach to government officials who oversee the areas in which the show happens, such as City Council members José Huizar (District 14) and Gilbert Cedillo (District 1).",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Through Meet Me @the Metro: Theatre/In/Transit, Company of Angels (CoA) seeks to reach people who would not otherwise be able to experience art and connect them with communities that offer art and culture. Our vision is to serve both artists and audiences from all of Los Angeles’ communities. Some key populations we want to reach out to include under-represented groups from downtown skid row with plans to incorporate a group of skid row performers who have taken some of our theatre workshops into the show. We will also set aside a portion of our tickets for audience members from key zip codes that have a high concentration of low income residents and we will have bilingual marketing to reach out to the Spanish speaking community along the Gold line. Historically the more affluent and theatre going community has been well represented in this brand of work so we are confident that our goal to reach out to the less fortunate will not preclude us from marketing to all of Los Angeles. In fact, the mixture and connecting of different races and economic levels is one of the main goals of M3TNT. The artists - writers, designers, actors, directors, stage managers whose work we will exhibit will all represent the communities that make up Los Angeles’ diverse landscape and so they too are beneficiaries of this project's magic. It should be noted, that CoA has a long record of multicultural work. Out of the last 37 main stage productions since 2007, 35 have depicted under-represented communities, including the LGBTQ, Thai, Mexican immigrant, African-American, Japanese, and South Asian communities (The other two plays, which depicted the White community, were directed by artists of color).",

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "As with any large-scale project, Meet Me @the Metro: Theater/In/Transit has the challenge of getting the necessary funding to successfully connect communities from all over Los Angeles together. To date we have begun to reach out to organizations that have funded this type of work in the past such as the MAP Fund, The James Irvine Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts (to name a few). We have also begun to explore online fundraising and Crowd funding sites such as Razoo, Kickstarter, Indie go go and CauseVox. The strategy to deal with any financial shortcomings or with problems meeting the budget is to seek more in-kind contributions and only then to diminish the scale of the project to equal the available resources if necessary. Another challenge is the mechanism through which we will conduct outreach for the target communities and the evaluations of the project after it closes. The availability of quality staff with this type of transit-oriented site-specific experience is limited and a lot of training may be necessary to assure the smooth operation of the logistics involved with transporting an audience over multiple Metro stops. The strategy we will employ to deal with this is to make the fee for people who know this brand of performance competitive enough to secure the services of these highly qualified individuals.",

Play the LA River takes inspiration from the many artists who have played a major role since the 1980s in river revitalization by defining the LA River not as a concrete channel or ditch but as a riparian ecosystem and rich civic space. Learning from these longstanding efforts among artists working in partnership with grassroots organizations and elected officials, Play the LA River aspires to seed a new generation of river leaders and champions by bringing thousands of Angelenos to sites up and down the river’s 51 miles—and by doing so through play! Along these lines, the project also has learned from three decades of public advocacy and education that the LA River is its own best advocate.

This staff person would shepherd Play the LA River interns and volunteers and would provide critical support given the time-based challenges of the project’s founding leadership group and programming team. Second, Play the LA River plans to make the card deck and all Project 51-led events free to the public and hence to communities across LA.

By first tracking simple statistics like attendance and revenue, and over time peeling deeper into these and other subjects in a transparent and cross-enterprise approach, we have adjusted our institutional culture to that of a well-oiled machine that can work together to problem-solve challenges. Today, we seek to be a preeminent family of Museums – not just good, not just great, but preeminent. As such, about a year ago we noticed that our “net promoter scores” and other visitor satisfaction scores were beginning to slip below what we felt were acceptable. (We aim for 90% satisfaction at the Tar Pits, which we have achieved at the Natural History Museum in Exposition Park.) It was clear from our findings that improvements to the Tar Pits and Museum needed to be made.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate.

Specifically, while we aren’t prepared to launch a complete Museum overhaul at this time, a reimagining of the Museum is quite possible in the coming years. Therefore, we want to invest in projects that can be meaningful to these long-term aspirations -- either as prototypes for larger ideas, or components that will be repurposed when a completely new experience is created. We do not want to be wasteful in our upgrades. Our strategy for successful implementation is to continue with our creative approach as described above including testing new ideas and experimenting with programming.

Last year the Museum hosted more than 49,000 students, teachers and chaperones from 575 schools.

As some of you can relate to, everything changes once you have a child. I vowed that day that I would give her the best life and education that I possibly could. As any parent would do, I researched and read several books on parenting and education. Book after book, a pattern kept jumping out at me: children who are raised with an emphasis on social interdependence and collaboration are proven to lead more wholesome and successful lives. Scientific research* indicates that when students are subject to creative learning, it results in higher achievement, greater productivity, more caring, supportive and committed relationships, have higher social competence, and self esteem... the list goes on and on. So I made the decision. I’m going to do more than just put Nya through college. I’m going to do everything in my creative power to help every child that passes through our educational system become more wholesome individuals.",

    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "LA is poised to be a national environmental leader after adopting the country's most far-reaching waste and recycling overhaul —the Zero Waste LA Franchise. LAANE and the Don’t Waste LA Coalition led the campaign to adopt this system, approved in April 2014. The new system calls for LA to divert 90% of waste from landfills and requires recycling for all customers. As part of meeting this ambitious diversion goal, waste haulers are required to submit an organic waste collection plan for all multifamily and commercial customers, as food scraps and yard trimmings make up a third of what is sent to landfills. However, the region currently lacks the capacity to process all of our organic waste, creating an opportunity for innovation and investment. Given the benefits of converting organic waste to compost, our project will lay the groundwork for LA to take advantage of this opportunity.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "LA businesses and residents send about 1.2 million tons of food scraps and yard waste to landfills each year. Such compostable “organic” material forms over 1/3 of the City’s landfill waste.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Food waste is nearly 33% of what is sent to landfills and decomposing food waste creates over 15% of US methane emissions. By eliminating food waste from landfills, composting and anaerobic digestion reduce climate change impacts. By keeping food waste local, the project will also reduce air pollution from transporting food waste and yard trimmings to composting operations and landfills in Kern County and San Bernardino, where our organic waste is processed.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "In the first year, we will complete the study, research, and policy development that will be the foundation and structure of the project.

But our ocean is not limitless. More than two thirds of the world’s fisheries are harvested at capacity, threatening our food supply, marine ecosystem, and coastal lifestyle. Seafood for the Future is a nonprofit seafood advisory program building a community of consumers, chefs, restaurants, fisheries, and farmers to promote healthy seafood choices. We are the only regional group working across the supply chain, but we need new tools for consumers to tackle the issue from the demand side. With demand for sustainable seafood, we can ensure that people, fish, and the ocean are all part of the equation.",

    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The primary beneficiaries of this proposal are low-income households with limited access to fresh or healthy food in Northeast Los Angeles, specifically those in Elysian Valley. There is a real and demonstrated need for increased food access in many neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County, and the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens provide a readily implementable, hands-on approach to mitigating the adverse health impacts associated with limited food options. This lack of access is underscored by the fact that Elysian Valley meets the USDA's criteria for a food desert - it is a low-income neighborhood where most of its residents live more than half a mile from the nearest market, a significant concern in this automobile dependent neighborhood. In addition to this USDA designation, as Los Angeles prepares its new Health and Wellness Element for the General Plan, the Planning Department has released data revealing that residents of Elysian Valley are in the lowest bracket for neighborhood food sources (9) and exhibits a childhood obesity rate of 28%. Elysian Valley’s childhood obesity rate is the key demographic indicator targeted for change by the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens. While this grant application seeks funds to support the research, production and installation of a Ribbon Garden network in Elysian Valley, the lessons learned as part of this pilot project will be applied to other communities in food deserts throughout Los Angeles. As a result, this means that while the initial impact of this proposal is primarily at the neighborhood scale, its long-term influence will be felt throughout Los Angeles. Secondary beneficiaries of the Ribbon Gardens proposal include visitors and residents of the neighborhood as the network of lush planters will help activate the streetscape and provide a more welcoming and lively public realm.",

This strategy is in direct response both to LA City Council’s August 2013 15-0 vote to allow urban gardening to take root in public parkways (the area between sidewalk and curb) as well as Mayor Garcetti's numerous statements regarding the implementation of urban gardening as a strategy to combat food deserts in Los Angeles. A series of eight planting structures, ranging from simple raised planting beds, to benches with embedded planter spaces, to raised tree planters with built-in storage units, have been custom designed to fit within these parkways.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "As described above, in April 2014, a block-level installation of the Ribbon Gardens approach was tested in Oakland, California. Working with community partners and building the planters provided an indispensable opportunity to learn about the strengths and challenges of the Ribbon Gardens approach, refine planter designs and imparted two major lessons: 1) the importance of community buy-in and ownership, and 2) the need for a suite of planter options to accommodate various levels of needs and interests. As the Ribbon Gardens inherently become visible fixtures in the community and require the participation of property owners and a commitment to planting and maintaining them, broad community support is needed. By holding community outreach events and capitalizing upon the neighborhood’s demonstrated interest in local food production, we are confident in our ability to engender participation and support. Recognizing that residents in the community will have varying levels of time and interest in such an endeavor, we have developed a broader spectrum of Ribbon Garden planter elements to enable residents to choose the level of participation suitable for them- from a small herb garden to full-scale food production.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The implementation strategy for the Ribbon Gardens proposal primarily revolves around two concurrent elements: 1) fostering community support and engagement and 2) design, installation and planting of the various Ribbon Garden elements. Element one is achievable through Global Green’s extensive expertise at capacity building and community planning combined with the neighborhood’s demonstrated interest in food access through the creation of its community garden. Element two is achievable as the planters have already been designed and a planting palette has been developed. Further, we have previously tested this concept at the block level in April 2014 in Oakland, California, and from this event, we are prepared for neighborhood-scale integration. The implementation of the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal will include the following steps: refine designs and communication materials; begin community outreach; acquire construction and planting materials; build planter kits; host community installation event; evaluate progress and build capacity for expanding Ribbon Gardens network to other food deserts in Los Angeles.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal will directly impact six of the 10 “Live” LA2050 metrics and two of the three LA2050 “Dream Metrics.” Access to healthy food is directly impacted through the production of fruits and vegetables. Natural uptake by the plants will reduce exposure to air toxins. The number of households below the self-sufficiency standard will be reduced through a reduction in grocery costs for these fruits and vegetables. Food deserts are often characterised by pronounced obesity, and by offering low-cost, nearby fresh and healthy food, community members will be able to make healthier consumptions decisions. Increasing the amount of greenery and trees in the neighborhood will simultaneously serve to beautify and activate the streetscape, yielding an improved pedestrian realm. The increased canopy cover and prevalence of plants will reduce stormwater impacts on polluted waterways through improved natural processes such as groundwater infiltration and evapotranspiration.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Three specific metrics we will use to evaluate the planning, implementation and ongoing success of the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens are 1) the level of participation in community programs, 2) the number of Ribbon Garden Planters installed and 3) the amount of fresh fruit and vegetables grown. Studying the level of participation in community programs will reveal direct engagement with neighborhood residents. The total number of Ribbon Garden Planters installed in Elysian Valley will demonstrate community interest, viability of this approach and the full extent of the Ribbon Garden network. The total amount of food produced will be used to calculate the effectiveness of the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens in combatting food desert conditions in Elysian Valley. All three of these metrics will work in concert to serve as a barometer for effectiveness and help guide future iterations of Ribbon Gardens in other food deserts around Los Angeles.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Though the Ribbon Gardens planter elements are low cost, easy to assemble, do not require a fixed foundation and the city has expressed significant interest in innovative solutions to addressing our food desert problem, challenges still remain. The first major challenge facing the successful implementation of the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens is getting buy-in from individual property owners to allow installation of the planter elements in the public parkways in front of their homes. This will require extensive outreach and coordination as well as assistance from community ambassadors committed to seeing this project to fruition. We are poised to meet this challenge through two approaches. First, individual property owners will be asked to sign agreements to allow installation and water the plants. Second, designated block captains will work to coordinate necessary plant care and harvest events. The second major challenge we anticipate is the necessary upkeep, maintenance, repair and additional installations of each Ribbon Garden planter element. Though costs for these demands will be covered by grant funds, the requisite coordination, prioritization and outreach involved in these tasks will require significant attention. This challenge will be addressed through careful monitoring, working with block captains and holding regular Ribbon Gardens community meetings to identify trends and developing issues in order to address them as efficiently as possible.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "The USDA has estimated that 23.5 million US residents live in food deserts- low-income areas where a significant share of residents is more than half a mile from the nearest market- and Los Angeles is home to many such pockets of limited food access. Elysian Valley is one of the most prominent of these food deserts, particularly due to its geography with the LA river to it’s east and south and 5 and 2 freeways to the north and west. As a result of this hemmed-in nature, ease of access to produce is particularly critical, and the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal will help alleviate some of the pressures associated with living in a food desert while simultaneously advancing public discourse and engagement in a proactive, hands-on approach. Access to fresh and healthy food has been identified as one of the key indicators in many health issues in the American populace, and by empowering residents of Elysian Valley with the capacity to grow their own, the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal continues already established community momentum in this vein.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Three potential collaborators for this project- The Northeast LA Riverfront Collaborative, The Elysian Valley Community Garden and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The initial concept for the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens was developed as a competition entry for the Northeast LA Riverfront Collaborative. Our proposal won an Honorable Mention from competition judges and signals the viability of this proposal. Moving forward, we intend to connect with the Collaborative to gain their regional expertise and assistance with implementing the Ribbon Gardens approach in other food deserts in Northeast LA."

    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Open Grove recognizes its place in a much larger urban sustainability movement in Los Angeles that provides environmental, economic, and societal benefits to Angelenos. By funding two networks to collaborate on installing Urban Orchards on institutional land, this project will effectively free up more unused land to increase food production. It will also do two vital things: 1) it will enhance the food justice collaboration between secular and religious sectors and 2) it will give voice to the religious and spiritual people / institutions in LA that have not yet been harnessed and serve to literally and figuratively “feed” this growing food movement. Specifically, Open Grove is part of the much larger urban greening, local food production, and food justice movements. By engaging powerful faith-based allies across the city in planting urban orchards, Open Grove will amplify the social and environmental benefits of tree planting for food, creating positive effects that will last for decades.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Specific partners that have been identified are the Metropolitan Water District, Greywater Corps, The River Project, LA Community Garden Council, New Horizon Muslim School in Pasadena, the New Community Jewish High School, Temple Beth Hillel, the North Hollywood Interfaith Food Pantry, the Unitarian Universalist Church, Temple Beth Ohr, All Saints Episcopal Church, Temple Beth Israel of Highland Park and Eagle Rock, the Prince of Peace Episcopal Church and the West Valley Food Pantry as a demonstration orchard and a model of the direct orchard-to-pantry model.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Number of institutions. Our goal is to have 500 faith-based institutions involved by 2050 with an average of ten trees planted at each participating congregation's property.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "“There are, it seems, two muses: the Muse of Inspiration, who gives us inarticulate visions and desires, and the Muse of Realization, who returns again and again to say \"It is yet more difficult than you thought.\"",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We are two organizations with strong and engaged community networks. We have three shovel-ready sites waiting for project implementation. Netiya and Seeds of Hope both possess proven track records with many combined years of experience working in partnership with communities both installing and sustaining gardens and orchards. This is evidence of our ability to continue to build out a successful and sustainable garden program that is fully integrated into the conventions of the institution.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Mosques, synagogues and churches are our greatest source of ready-to-repurpose open spaces in the city. We harness the institutional power of congregations by repurposing fallow land into orchards. Project Open Grove transforms the urban landscape with a simple idea rooted in ancient texts: tithing harvests. Tithing is the act of donating 10% of one’s resources to address the needs of the under-resourced within and around our communities.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Netiya advances institutional collaboration around food procurement and food relief to grow community food security.",

    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The collaboration of Netiya and Seeds of Hope through Open Grove involves engaging the untapped power of our faith-based institutions around food justice. As a combined network of close to 250 institutions, we start with accessing willing partners that can offer acreage, resources, and volunteers from our institutions. We build out a collaborative network wherein Open Grove offers institutions with deeply rooted and, in many cases, shared ethics, an opportunity to become powerfully aligned with one another around food justice in LA.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Converting faith-based institutions’ unused land into productive green space will expand urban green areas and bring about related environmental benefits. These include temperature reduction, energy conservation, fewer smog and red alert days, improved water quality, and sequestering of greenhouse gases. In particular, there is an acute awareness of the need for more green space in low-income urban environments. In this way, Open Grove’s approach can have a particularly powerful impact on the health of these communities, as religious institutions are very strong players and can become a starting point for cultivating new and improved access to green spaces."

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "South LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Resilient South LA nonprofits will become local capacity builders and earn income as community-based consulting firms. Organizations that have shown expertise over decades, increased resources and moved key policy will assist newer nonprofits and leaders to strengthen their organizations and achieve their missions. Local veteran nonprofits could earn millions over time through quality consulting and organizational development services. SoACT will coordinate, train and support these nonprofits to develop their consulting practices and expand indigenous knowledge. With consolidated marketing using social media and effective strategic planning, we will collaborate to keep consulting dollars in South LA and build a robust nonprofit scaffold.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1) A market exists for capacity building services that several South LA nonprofits are poised to enter",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Two of the major barriers we anticipate in this project include: 1) issues of scheduling and deployment of capacity builders given the ordinary demands of their current assignments; and 2) earning the trust and support of funders that have high expectations and standards for the consultants they hire.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",

By 2050, we will have a critical mass of well-trained leaders and managers to move agendas of equity and justice and sustain revitalized and innovative nonprofits. Nonprofits will have easier access to technical assistance to improve systems and make better use of volunteers. With stronger, more collaborative and strategic community organizations, South LA residents will receive better services, play a larger role in the governance of local organizations, and find new pathways to engage in community.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our project will benefit the leadership, staff, members and clients of the 100 South LA nonprofits who will receive capacity building services – including the 20 who receive individualized consulting – the 9 South LA nonprofits who will provide these services, and the communities that these organizations serve. We are particularly committed to working with nonprofits invested in civic engagement, local community building and grassroots organizing, including social service agencies that seek to understand and engage their clients as a constituency.",

    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "In many ways the Women’s Center for Creative Work is well underway! We have a strong community of women makers who are already attending Women’s Dinners, going to and leading workshops, taking part in our “Workers in Residence” program at our residencies, and in general giving their support to the WCCW in real life and online.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We constantly work with collaborators and partners, and inevitably there would be many involved in this project, but none that have been specifically identified yet.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Proposed collaboration (we want to work with partners!)",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The Women's Center for Creative Work would be another exciting arts and cultural organization in Los Angeles. It would directly create jobs within the creative economy and indirectly through connections made between women through the organization. The organization is women, owned, run and operated and we endeavor to create opportunities for women of all backgrounds to become involved. We hope that by creating opportunities and community within the city, and support systems for creative practices outside of the academic systems., that graduates will stay in Los Angeles County after they graduate.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "-Sustainability of the WCCW model.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. People in LA are craving physical community: The WCCW started off with a Women’s Dinner (still our signature event). That first dinner was intended to be a one-off projects, but people asked us over and over when the next one would be, and when we did the next one, questions arose about how to keep this energy going. We realized from this feedback that there is a real need for intentional community in Los Angeles. People are excited about the opportunity to connect in a space: over working, over making, over friendship. Our cultural climate has this strong sense of digital connectivity through social media, but what we’ve learned is that digital model is a bit vacant, and people are hungry for real physical community in real physical space.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Creative women of all kinds will benefit from the space, especially those whose jobs/projects are of a more freelance nature, which is so common in this city: screenwriters, graphic designers, small business owners, stylists, comedians, landscape architects, etc... would have a place to come work within a supportive environment, proving a welcome alternative to having to take meetings at Starbucks. Through our varied activities and interests, we endeavor to make the WCCW as open and welcoming to all women as we possibly can and are particularly committed to intergenerational and cross-cultural conversations around women's creative work.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Los Angeles is a collection of nodal centers, some very spread out from each other. In order to cultivate community in this rhizomatic city one has to be very deliberate–most of us get in our cars and drive somewhere rather than walking along the street. This lack of street culture leads to a brevity of the sort of chance interactions that can be very generative, creatively and otherwise. With a permanent physical space, the WCCW could function as a gathering place and foster an environment which allows for chance meetings and conversations as well as more formalized events, exhibitions, and workshops.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We would spend two months scouting out potential spaces and securing a rental. As our community is largely centered on the East Side of LA, we hope to find an open warehouse-type space near Downtown, Chinatown, or East L.A. We would spend two months building out the space into 8-10 separate studio/office spaces based on the size, and a large communal space. During this build out time, we would be in conversations with our network to make sure that the studio spaces would be filled as soon as the building was able to be occupied. We should be able to attend to the physical aspects of the space in under 6 months, and be able to spend the following 6 months building community within it via programming such as exhibitions, forums, workshops, conversations and events, as well as running the shared workspace.",

Mental health is not one-size-fits-all. To benefit the largest group we will tailor workshops, events, and educational literature to specific communities: first year students, international students, student athletes, veterans, students who identify as part of the LGBTQIA community, and students who identify as part of specific cultural communities. But mental health does not stop when a student graduates. Our campaign will provide continuing care resources for postgraduate students as they move beyond the UCLA community.",

    "goal": "CREATE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Our goal is to create an ever-evolving space where the public can be fully emerged in participatory environments that include installations",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our project benefits mainly the downtown and surrounding areas but our aim is to be a haven for all of Los Angeles county. Our membership takes part in different installations and events all over the county as a group and individually so our reach is much further than our physical location. We are intent on working with multi-faceted groups of different economic levels and age ranges and purposefully offer a scale of events to reflect our goal. Primarily our target age range is 18-55 although we work to include younger and older audiences through different mediums. We are open to all and do not discriminate but a large percent of our membership consists of strong women and encourage all women to take on leadership roles.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "As a young and emerging arts center, we have already directly and indirectly created jobs between members, other organizations and directly through The L.A. Fort itself. We always encourage and support the growth of other spaces as well.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We have quarterly performance reviews that we ask our patrons to complete as well as monthly public meetings where all input is welcome and encouraged. We collect most of our data through GoogleForms and Survey Monkey. We encourage honest feedback to properly re-calibrate our operations and are always looking to improve.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1. The biggest barrier we face is the lack of funds to implement all of our ideas. We have a very strong team full of ambition and unique dreams that want to succeed and build new ways to participate in the music and arts in Los Angeles while creating creative economy and developing social and cultural awareness.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "In 2012 we opened The L.A. Fort with the idea of creating a place where the public could come learn new skills, teach each other, grow creatively, and invest in their own creative capital while maintaining social and environmental awareness and ensuring sustainability. Membership is open to the public for all to participate and enjoy.Our main struggle in fully realizing this idea has been acquiring permits for the performance arts space. We aim to acquire permanent permits in order to heavily involve the public.In the short amont of time ocupying our phisical space we have produced and curated a series of all inclusive programs and art events complete with full installations made and produced by our membership.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Pasadena Arts Alliance is our fiscal sponsor who has 50 years of experience in the arts in Los Angeles.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. Developing a creative economy while building community amongst artist and musician can be very challenging and rewarding. In providing a space for the community to actively participate in alternative music and art we have seen first hand the collective spirit that enables the community to be the change they want to see happen and have a decisive voice in their future.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We are a very hard working team. Our space is almost unrecognizable from when we moved in a little over a year and a half ago. Up until now, we have been totally self sufficient relying on the willingness of our community for material, financial, and time donations. We have already done the majority of the leg work, most important of which, creating a positive reputation. With the proper funding it would not take us long to reach our desired goal.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We currently work out of a 5,000 sq ft space that is permitted for offices. To implement our idea, we would build more ADA accessible restrooms, change the permits for the space use to performance art space and offices. We will also be able to hire a permitting consultant and make small aesthetic changes to the space to make it more suitable for different audiences and community members.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Our aim is to become a neighborhood cultural institution by focusing on education and accessibility to LA contemporary artists. By empowering our base through meetings where members get to decide the direction of projects, we are creating community building experiences and building generations of community leaders."

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One potential barrier of this project might be the difficulty to reach out to people that do not have access to smart phones or similar hand-held devices. Though the number of people who have access to this technology has rapidly increased, low-income populations and minorities may not have as much access to this technology and they are populations that are disproportionately affected by air pollution. Current research from the Pew Foundation (http://www.pewinternet.org/) shows that in 2014, 90% of American adults have a cell phone and 58% have a smart phone. This statistic does not vary much by ethnicity with a slightly higher take up rate of smart phone within the Hispanic community (61%). Lower income populations of less than $30,000 annual income report a 47% take up rate. This provides us with still half of the population with cell phones in low income areas, which we believe will be adequate to spread the word.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Solo actor (just us on this project!)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "UCLA is a research university focused on the creation, dissemination, preservation and application of knowledge for society's betterment.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We will use publicly available information available from the US EPA about Toxic Releases and Air Quality that has been made available to the public but is currently in a format relatively difficult to access and digest for most people. For example, the TRI was developed by the EPA as a tool of information disclosure to encourage low releases of air toxics by facilities but this information has not been used much by the population yet because of its complexity. Researchers and students at UCLA have recently launched a website, Cal EcoMaps, to communicate this information to the residents of Los Angeles through an interactive map. Our objective is to build on this platform to provide people with a mobile application that will provide real time information about air quality, allow users to upload their own information and access this information in various locations.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Exposure to air toxins",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Learning that more than 8 million pounds of toxics were released in the Los Angeles area just in 2012 alone is shocking. Many of these toxics are carcinogens and/or harm other integral systems of the body. A preliminary analysis has also revealed that these releases are on the rise. Though facilities are required to report their releases into the air, water and land they are usually not mandated by law to reduce their releases. The TRI was developed as an information disclosure tool to encourage companies to perform better environmentally and this goal hasn’t been achieved to a great degree. Providing this information to the public so that we may all take action to reduce the toxics released into our environment was a strong motivation for developing this project.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This project is intended to benefit the common resident of Los Angeles by creating awareness of the air pollution in their neighborhoods and communities through MyAir LA. This is an especially useful tool for populations that are vulnerable to air pollution. This project has implications for the health of minorities and sensitive populations, which are adversely impacted by low air quality. Approximately 40% of California’s residents live in high traffic areas. This number is significantly higher in densely populated areas such as Los Angeles. Populations of non-white residents, minorities and low-income households are higher near major roadways almost everywhere in the nation but this disparity is much higher in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area. People of lower socio-economic status disproportionately incur the negative health effects of air pollution more than other segments of the population. It is also these families that are likely to have least access to this kind of information about air quality and have low awareness of mitigation options. By providing them with health tips to reduce their exposure they can make healthier choices. Parents can be more cognizant of what the best times are to take their children outdoors. Residents can determine what times are best for outdoor exercise.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "To begin with, this project will be evaluated by the number of people who download the MyAir mobile application. Areas of Los Angeles where the application is being accessed will also be recorded. This may highlight potential communities who do not have awareness of this application or who do not have access to the technology. This will enable us to conduct a targeted and more effective campaign in those areas if required. MyAir will also include a feedback page for users to provide comments and/or suggestions for improvement, which will then be taken into consideration as the application is improved. The features of the MyAir application that are most used will also be observed to judge the effectiveness of information communication",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementing this project within the next 12 months is a realizable goal. The data for developing the mobile application is publicly available. Additional analysis of the data to better communicate it will be required and is expected to take about a month. Developing and testing the mobile application is expected to take about 4 months. A campaign for spreading awareness about MyAir is expected to go along with the development of the mobile application and will continue even after the application is launched. The development of the project is expected to last 6 months. Beyond that, time will be spent in evaluating the success of MyAir, improving upon it and generating more awareness.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "MyAir LA will provide residents of Los Angeles comprehensive information easily accessible through a mobile application about the manufacturing sources of air pollution and information about the current air quality (AQ) in their neighborhood. 376 facilities in the Los Angeles area report to EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). These facilities emitted more than 8 million pounds of toxics into our environment in 2012 alone. With MyAir LA people will easily access current air quality in their location and tips to enable them to make healthier lifestyle choices. Users will also be able to upload personal tips and pictures on the mobile application and use the application to contact facilities directly to encourage them to reduce toxic releases",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Los Angeles continues to have some of the most polluted air in the nation. We need air to survive each moment of each day and when the very thing we need to live is polluted, the quality of our life is greatly diminished. Providing TRI information and AQ information will both work towards improving the air in Los Angeles in different ways. Reducing the negative effects of air pollution will not only require public policy but will also require individual action.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We don't have any outside collaborators but several researchers at UCLA are part of the MyAir LA team.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Exposure to air toxins will be reduced as people are given tips on how to reduce their exposure to poor quality based on the AQ information provided by monitoring stations in Los Angeles. Sensitive populations will be identified based on real-time AQ and targeted heath advice and tips to mitigate exposure will be provided through MyAir LA."

LACE Center is an art establishment serving regions of L.A. that do not host many creative industry spaces. With this, we are employing non-traditional folks within the creative industries, name formerly incarcerated people, people with homeless experience, transgender people, people of color, immigrants and youth (ages 16-24). These are key groups to develop leadership within as people most highly affected by systems of violence and oppression.",

Media and images are all around us-- billboards, magazines, films and music, art is in our consciousness every day, shaped by powerful industries many based in L.A. However, access to creative arts resources is at an all time low among underserved communities-- namely, low-income people of color, LGBT community, immigrant communities, youth and mothers. LAUSD has cut arts funding 76% in the last 5 years, and the industry of Hollywood is inaccessible to the majority of people in L.A.. Many other people (who have access and resource to do so) are telling stories about marginalized people in L.A., people who may have no experience LIVING in these communities, and as such, continue narratives of violence, poverty and trauma.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The Project enhances the level of employment in creative industry by tapping the professional involvements of creative artists in the fields of design, visual art, public art, and art installations. Further, the Project establishes a new creative industry by expanding the Piece by Piece social enterprise infrastructure to include many more workshops and training sites. Exposure to Piece by Piece brought through the project is anticipated to expand its networks and sustainable resources such that expansion brought through the project will institutionalize within the organization for the years that follow. Piece by Piece currently engages 22 artists for programming; we anticipate the need to double this roster in 2015 in the context of the LA Mosaic Mecca Project and continue that trajectory of growth in service to workshop/training sites implemented in 2015 that remain in place for years to follow.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The high level of artistic quality that has emerged among Piece by Piece Artisans is a testament to the artists that facilitate workshops. Under the leadership of Artistic Director, Dawn Mendelson, our Instructional Staff and Roster of Visiting Artists reflect a broad-based talent that is widely recognized within the arts community, as demonstrated by Piece by Piece support from the National Endowment for the Arts, the California Arts Commission, the Los Angeles County Arts Commission and the Cultural Affairs Department of Los Angeles. Commissions designed, fabricated and installed by Piece by Piece team of artists and trained-Artisans include a Public Art project for the city of Hollywood, a mural for Irvine College, wall art for Universal Studios, among others. This portfolio of work can be viewed on the Piece by Piece web. Piece by Piece operations are managed by Lisa Marsh, who comes to the organization with more than 30 years of experience developing programs in both arts education and in services to homeless populations. She provides direction to the effort to build out Piece by Piece as a social enterprise model, leveraging resources from within Skid Row Housing Trust networks and beyond to bring the model in service of Skid Row residents. Piece by Piece Board of Directors include professionals from multiple fields and is chaired by Mike Alvidrez, the Executive Director of the Trust. Mr. Alvidrez is widely recognized for his leadership in addressing the need among homeless populations of Los Angeles for supportive housing. He brings to Piece by Piece a vision for harnessing the power of art to transform the urban setting and the desire to deploy the Piece by Piece model among those who are most in need of the learning opportunities that Piece by Piece provides. At the heart of this leadership is Piece by Piece founder, Sophie Alpert. Sophie has placed enormous energy and talent toward forming and incubating the Piece by Piece model, harnessing a wide range of resources and form deep connections with supporters that have together nurtured the program to a level of success that has prepared it for broad implementation in Skid Row. Her commitment to the program and guidance in directing its future continue to add tremendous value to Piece by Piece and its development as a social enterprise. Together, this leadership team and all of the resources it brings to bear on implementing the LA Mosaic Mecca project assures achievement of goals.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "To implement the Project, Piece by Piece will direct its resources and networks of support toward the planning and design for a major mosaic installation in Skid Row. Our partner, the Trust, enjoys deep connections in the downtown community and will assist our effort to identify an appropriate location for the LA Mosaic Mecca installation. Our training programs will focus on skill sets and special topics that prepare participants to serve as Artisans for Mosaic design, fabrication and installation. We will engage more than 60 Visiting Artists, including both from among the roster of Mosaic, Design and Public Art professionals who have previously served Piece by Piece and outreach to new artists supplying knowledge, skill and talent to the project. We will form new partnerships, including with the Digital Mural Lab of UCLA SPARC, a unique research and teaching facility that brings state of the art computer technology to the production of community-based art. We will engage our Social Media Manager toward the end of connecting Los Angeles, city-wide, to our Mosaic Mecca ambitions. We will gain the support of representatives of the City, and of the local business community that is rapidly expanding within downtown neighborhoods in and surrounding the Skid Row area, including both the Spring Street Arts Corridor and the Arts District. To provide full public access to the Mosaic Mecca activity, we will open a storefront withing Arts District Flea, and take part in events organized through Grand Performances, Renegade Craft Fair and KCRW Summer Nights, among others. Our outreach will include extensive search for volunteers to assist the Mosaic Mecca Project at every level – from planning and design to prep and installations.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "More than 60 artists will benefit through their role as change-agents, more than doubling the roster of artists currently with Piece by Piece. More than 100 Skid Row Residents will benefit through arts learning, skills training and transitional employment. Some among these will springboard toward their own career as artists. Others will attain permanent employment as a result of the job experience impact on their resume. 300 community volunteers will gain connection with artists and with their own creativity and deepen their commitment to ending homelessness and making LA a better place for all of its residents. Those who live, work or frequent the site chosen for the LA Mosaic Mecca will benefit from the beautification. The many groups currently working to develop economy and culture in districts that comprise the city’s core will benefit from enhanced connectivity stemming from the project’s implementation and broad outreach for inputs and support.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Piece by Piece operates a social enterprise model that deploys professional artists to provide skills training to economically disenfranchised and vulnerable persons who take part in transitional employment and training that prepares them for permanent job placement. Trainees achieving Artisan status additionally earn income through engagement in mosaic art projects commissioned to Piece by Piece. Lessons informing our solution include",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "This strategic partnership with Skid Row Housing Trust brings to Piece by Piece the resource of direct collaboration with personnel working within each of the Trust’s 24 buildings in Skid Row, the resource of administrative staffing, and a permanent studio space for located in the Trust’s Star Apartment Complex.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Serving vulnerable populations.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Picture a culturally-diverse workforce engaged with artists and supported by enthusiastic volunteers. The impassioned intention of this collective is to bring into realty a powerful work of mosaic art that transforms the urban jungle of Skid Row to become a go-to destination among all lovers of art. Mosaic is the perfect art form for this wide berth of participation – it is user-friendly (anyone can learn), it upcycles waste glass (plentiful supply), it is most powerful when large and, when large, it requires a large number of persons to provide labor. The LA Mosaic Mecca Project, however, is not art for beauty's sake. This art has a powerful mechanism -- art training to members of Skid Row community most in need of such benefit.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "The idea of transformative art is not new: The Urban Mosaic Intervention conducted in Chile by Isadora Paz Lopez was manifested for a town bisected by concrete rails. Photos at www.mosaicartnow are not easily forgotten. In Chile the need was for transforming an ugly landscape. In Los Angeles the need is toward recognizing the resource of artists for addressing urban problems within systems of education, social service, workforce development, government and urban planning.",

We expanded the idea to allow area residents, in that case living within 3 miles, to compete for work at the site. With the willingness of the HR director at the hotel, just after opening we approximated 28% of the workforce as local. Beyond the community benefit, it was here I began to think about the value in savings to local traffic and the infrastructure. In 2008, under a study funded by the Anne E Casey foundation, the Hollywood & Highland program received accolades for its standing as a workforce model. The benefits of local hiring can now be expanded through an incentive based permanent employment model.",

    "goal": "CREATE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "A communal printmaking lab offering free classes, workshops and lab time focusing on hand made art in an overly digital world.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "In this hyper digital, social media environment we find ourselves heavily reliant on our technology and grow further and further away from hand skills and tactile experiences. Our friendships, work and even leisure time need the screen to exist. We spend entirely too much time in this digital realm and so our focus is to provide balance. Co- creativity and experienced based learning help us to get out of our heads and into our physical bodies. Hands on learning and analog print processes stimulate creativity and new ideas. An emphasis on balance within our digital lives becomes more and more of a luxury as opposed to a normal learning experience. By activating the instinctive parts of our nature to make, create, learn and grow, we preserve and develop our fundamental human skills and connect us to our physical world, each other and our communities.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our programs will benefit youth and adults in the community, through a cooperative forum that makes available a collaberative, creative workspace and exhibition space that would typically not be accesible and/or affordable to many individuals. Our programs will help advance the public understanding and appreciation for the arts and the practical applications of making, reusing and the importance of hand made arts and analog processes. The specific and primary purpose of our studio is to promote the arts, as both a much needed form of expression and the practical application of these skills to develop and support art and design as a profession. A space where individuals can not only benefit from the practice of experienced based learning, but develop their interests and abilities into a way to make their art support them.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We will work closely with professional artists, writers and musicians in the community. Making the space available for guest speakers, workshops and classes. We have relationships with neighborhood schools (Allesandro Elementary, Dorris Place Elementary, Eagle Rock Elementary, Gabriella Charter School, Art Lab High School), LA River Revitalization Corp, Elysian Valley Arts Collective, Frogtown Artwalk, Bookshow (Independent artisan book store), Mitch O'Farrell, NELA art Organization, ArtCenter college.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "We are all creators. We all have the ability to make and create...art, stories, music. As kids we were all artists and imagination was vital. As technology advances and we get more and more digital we lose the ability to create...its no longer required we can access anything from our phones, we can drive fast and kill people in virtual game environments, new apps keep us staring down at the screen.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "In my youth I didn't have the support and guidance towards understanding that my art could sustain me. Seeing individuals that followed their own unique commitment to their art...helped me to realize I could create a path for myself...and not simply prescribe to someone elses idea of what that path should be. Providing a model for self sufficiency is as vital an education as any. Utilizing the visual arts as a form of expression and a way to support oneself spiritually and financially is especially important to the individual as well as the community as we strive to save and preserve these lost arts.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Coordinating with established educational programs in within the school year and common CORE guidelines",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "We have built an incredible art space in North East LA out of a love for the arts and as a catalyst for communal co creativity. The space is large enough to hold classes, workshops, events and gallery shows. We have wanted to find a way to share the space with as many who wish to participate. To activate this space as a community arts lab will require experienced staff, additional equipment and supplies.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Proposed collaboration (we want to work with partners!)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "To open our printmaking studio to the community as a co-creative art space with a focus on traditional hand arts and non digital media an often too digitized environment. As public school art programs disappear and kids spend more time in the digital realm, we feel it vitally important to preserve and explore traditional hand made arts.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Success for this project would be regular classes and workshops with active participation from the community and local schools. Success would also include visible implementation of the skills and tools out in the community through offsite workshops and outreach, for example bringing workshops to the schools not just bringing students into the workspace.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have built the space out of our own belief in the commitment to artistic expression and instinct.

    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Today, 20,000 children languish in LA’s foster care system. RAC will apply its successful model of recruiting prospective parents and helping match them with children awaiting loving homes by broadening its outreach to a more inclusive constituency. In addition to its LGBT audience, RAC will broaden its focus to include LA’s Latino and welcoming faith-based communities. RAC will further develop/expand its existing outreach model to a year-round initiative which will include an emphasis on a strong social media campaign supported by radio, television, outdoor advertising, and events to recruit and educate prospective parents. RAC also provides direct services to assist LA County DCFS to facilitate and expedite parent-child matches.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This project will reduce the number of children who continue to languish in LA’s foster care system by many as 2,000 within a two-year time frame. By connecting these children to loving adoptive homes, they are more likely to receive the support and medical and emotional attention that they need to thrive.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "In all likelihood, we anticipate that working with small grassroots partners/faith-based organizations will take more time/hand-holding than in the past although necessary given their value add access to our targeted communities. It may also be a challenge to identify and foster relationships with the faith-based community as their receptiveness to the LGBT community – our core constituency – has not always been the case.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Youth in foster care are in the system through no fault of their own -- and each of them deserves to experience a loving home where they can feel secure and thrive. According to recent statistics, nearly 110,000 children in foster care are waiting to be adopted, 20,000 in LA County alone. There are an additional 300,000 children in need of immediate foster placement. More than 1,000 enter foster care each day and remain there for an average of two years. The majority of foster agencies, including LA County DCFS, are unable to make the headway necessary to significantly decrease these numbers. Due to imbedded bureaucracy, budget and staffing constraints and outdated protocols, these agencies cannot provide the depth of services that the Parent Advocate Program delivers.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "RAC will expand its outreach and programs to a broader constituency including the heterosexual and Spanish language speaking communities.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "To accomplish this expansion to a more inclusive audience, RAC plans to work in tandem with its seven vetted foster/adopt partners in LA, with whom we have formal sponsorship agreements: LA County Department of Children & Family Services; Penny Lane Centers; Southern California Foster Family & Adoption Agency; The Village Family Services; Five Acres; Vista Del Mar; and Westside Children's Center. Each of these organizations will continue to work closely with RAC to help match available children with prospective parents and provide a seamless transition as the new initiative gets off the ground. RAC will seek out key leaders in the Hispanic community, an audience that has been researched for its feasibility and pilot tested with Penny Lane Centers, one of our partner agencies. Together, we placed several targeted spots on KLVE and KTNQ, popular Southern California Spanish language radio stations and the immediate response was that nearly 70 prospective foster/adopt parents signed up at our website or called the RAC office. We will also identify and reach out to welcoming clergy who might be willing to test pilot a small scale collaboration within their respective congregations. While RAC will benefit in the identification of children and parents to be matched as part of its core services by partnering with these entities, the value to them in finding homes for children, many of whom come from the populations they serve, will provide them a substantive role in addressing a critical community need in keeping with their respective missions.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "RaiseAChild.US (RAC) has an existing model which will drive and measure the success of the 20,000 LA Kids Project. Our Parent Advocate Program design is distinctive as it combines the personalized attention of a mentor with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system. The result is that RAC has a program that has been tested and proven, unlike any in the country, which provides measured and ongoing support and guidance to all of its prospective parents as they navigate the foster/adoption process. Through this custom designed, proprietary system, the Parent Advocate is able to easily and closely monitor the progress of each prospective parent.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Founded in 2011, RAC enjoyed immediate recruitment success as we launched a creative multi-media campaign to encourage the LGBT community of LA to build families through fostering and adoption. By 2012, our extended national reach and improved campaign strategies resulted in recruiting more than 600 prospective foster/adoptive parents. In 2013, RAC and Huffington Post Gay Voices launched a weekly series entitled “Let Love Define Family™.” Several of our stories have gone viral including http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/28/wendy-gay-family_n_5042297.html.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Every parent sees endless possibilities and great hope in the eyes of a child. As Angelenos, when we look at today’s children. But for our children to thrive and Los Angeles to stay a city in which people stay connected, we must support their development, their parents, their families and the public policies that work for all. Studies show that the earliest of experiences in supportive environments are essential to how children succeed in their lifetimes. In order for communities to come together cohesively to create a prosperous Los Angeles by 2050, we must invest in children now.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "This project meets two critically important metrics in the Connect application. First, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program directly addresses ‘Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support’ with its personalized service to all prospective parents navigating the foster/adoption process. Next, our close work with the LA County Department of Children and Family Services has been a key factor in the agency’s improved communication with waiting parents and increasing its child placement rate. This addresses the second (dream) metric of ‘Government responsiveness to residents’ needs.’"

This program will focus on strengthening and aligning the mind, body, & spirit.

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The goal for the AGEnts for Change Initiative is to expand the impact of AGEnts advocacy and education activities through a recruitment, education and mobilization process that will engage a new team of lead AGEnts to educate key legislators, other seniors in Los Angeles, and the general community about issues facing the aging population.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "St. Barnabas Senior Services (SBSS) initial AGEnts for Change Initiative achieved success in its first year of implementation. Due to the support of The SCAN Foundation, SBSS was able to recruit and train 32 seniors. Six emerged as lead advocates who actively informed key legislators, for-profit and non-profit organizations, and the general community about issues that are facing the senior population. Paramount to the success of the initiative was the empowerment of a diverse group of seniors who now take responsibility for educating themselves and others and can provide testament to their ability to positively impact their community.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The SCAN Foundation continues to assist with funding for the AGEnts for Change Initiative and their advice as well as funding has been important to our project.

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The AGEnts for Change Initiative will be evaluated against its objectives, three of which are specifically:",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. The experience of seniors who have become AGEnts for Change through SBSS. SBSS is in a strong position to initiate the enhancement of the AGEnts Initiative, not only because of its solid record of community engagement, but also as a direct result of the recent expansion of its service area to include the neighborhoods of Hollywood, Griffith Park, Los Feliz, Silver Lake, Atwater Village and Chevy Chase as served by the Hollywood Senior Multipurpose Center (HSMPC). This expansion has doubled SBSS’ geographic reach and increased the number of seniors served annually from 8,000 to nearly 18,000. This expansion has provided SBSS with the opportunity to reach an entirely new group of seniors who have the potential to become advocates for themselves and for the senior community. The diversity of this community will further strengthen the efforts of the AGEnts Initiative as SBSS is able to recruit and engage seniors who are representative of the cultural, linguistic and social richness of Los Angeles.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "SBSS will build on its successful experience in creating and conducting the AGEnts for Change program. The primary goal for the 2nd generation (G2) of the AGEnts for Change Initiative is to expand the impact of AGEnts advocacy and education activities by launching a revitalized recruitment, education and mobilization process that will engage a new cadre of lead AGEnts who will in turn educate key legislators, other seniors in Los Angeles, and the general community about issues facing the aging population. In order to achieve this goal, SBSS will do the following:",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The AGEnts for Change Initiative is a volunteer intensive program and through its efforts will increase the number of seniors involved as volunteers in policy and advocacy work in Los Angeles. In addition, the outcomes of the AGEnts for Change Initiative are specifically focused on impacting government responsiveness to senior issues, increasing services to seniors for social and emotional support among other needs and will stimulate attendance of seniors in public meetings."

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "What’s the future of housing in LA? Livability, mobility, affordability. The LA Forum for Architecture and Urbanism believes that design is a tool that supports sustainable and healthy lives. Through design’s lens, learning, living, playing, and creating are actualized as physical environments. \"Mobile Forum\" extends the agency for the imagination of how all of these elements connect across the constituents, experts, and leaders for whom LA is home.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Housing is a recurring topic within the LA Forum’s programming − for events ranging from building tours, to competitions, to panel discussions. In the summer of 2013, we hosted two simultaneous exhibitions on the subject: How Small is Too Small? and By-Right/By-Design. An installation of a 300 square foot micro-housing unit, How Small is Too Small? invited visitors to experience the spatial ramifications of a comfortable and compact housing arrangement. By-Right/By-Design was a side-by-side fiscal and material comparison of real estate development models and innovative design-driven projects.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The timeline provided below illustrates the achievability of the “Mobile Forum” goals within the next twelve months.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One challenge will be the synthesis of potentially wildly-divergent ideas about the future of housing into a cohesive set of proposals or tenets. We want to open up the discussion about housing to new and unexpected possibilities, but we also want to translate the richness of such conversations into a directable action. We’ll use design as the medium for focusing our efforts. This means designing workshop materials that encourage collaboration and participation; designing mechanisms for recording conversations in a visual manner that can be distributed back out to the public; and most importantly using design as the lens through which questions and proposals are posited and answered.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "\"Mobile Forum\" is a typical box truck turned migratory research hub and exhibition instigator. A demonstration of advanced ideas about home and housing, the vehicle gives a public presence to residential design discourse, one with the freedom to roam, solicit, and activate the region’s communal and creative capital. \"Mobile Forum\" instigates discussion by taking design questions and proposals on the road, encouraging people to talk to one another about the future conditions of living. It issues an open invitation to participate in the identification of neighborhood-by-neighborhood design cases and it provides the opportunity to bring the inventories to those with the means to influence change − and vice versa.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The LA Forum expects three types of collaborator-partners for “Mobile Forum” − community groups, governing bodies, and development organizations. If awarded the LA2050 support, “Mobile Forum” will consist of a team of designers and urbanists − from the LA Forum − between eight and ten community groups and/or governing bodies and two development organizations. This perfect storm of agents for the built environment will pool resources to cultivate the intellectual and material content of a proposal for a new approach to living.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "\"Mobile Forum\" will impact a number of the Live metrics immediately:",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "“Mobile Forum” targets residents living around new and proposed transit routes that are seeing or will see significant redevelopment growth and changing property valuation. These areas are subject to rapid reconstruction, displacing existing populations through eminent domain or rent inflation. The LA Forum project seeks to provide a sounding board for those involved in and impacted by the urban transformation. It aspires to produce concrete examples for building that innovates design inclusive of both established communities and of densification efforts."

Without that dramatically enhanced internal capacity, this iconic neighborhood is at risk of being shaped by outside forces.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will evaluate our success first by concrete measures of growth in the local creative industry. We have begun a baseline measure of the number of volunteer hours that currently sustain neighborhood cultural venues. This is our human capital, our sweat equity. The number of full- and part-time positions that can be generated to local creatives will be a significant measure of success.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "A committed team organized through the Leimert Park Village 20/20 Vision Initiative is in place.

    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Within the existing framework of the LPV 20/20 Vision Initiative, a grassroots community effort to shape the neighborhood’s economic development around its cultural and artistic identity, we will flesh out a year-long calendar of cultural events: the Summer Arts Program of the Manchester Junior Arts Center; a Village-wide Music Caravan to be held every few months with themes like Jazz, Blues, Mardi Gras, and World Music; a monthly Art Walk centered in the People’s Street Plaza; MLK Day Festival; Kwanza Festival; African-American Arts & Music Festival; and, in December the massive street festival CicLAvia.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "There is already a renaissance in Leimert Park Village, widely recognized as a hub of African-American cultural in Los Angeles. The socio-economic circumstances of the community belie its artistic wealth. Five MacArthur Genius Awards have been bestowed on artists with a history in the neighborhood--including Mark Bradford, who is investing in a major new arts education initiative. The ongoing effort of the Village to survive as an iconic American community is at the heart of our project.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "LPV Studios will give a dynamic community the tools to build a sustainable creative infrastructure, ensuring that future economic development is guided by the area’s rich artistic heritage.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Our core collaborators are the anchor cultural venues that will form the foundation of the Studio: all of whom are committed to the mission of the LPV 20/20 Vision Initiative; have begun coordinating a year-long schedule of festivals and cultural events, most recently a Village-wide Music Caravan; and have begun joint marketing through a shared website, cultural calendar, and LiveStream TV Station.",

First, each of CWC MV's 240 students will receive HEAR LA music instruction through its in-school and after-school programs. This number will increase annually, as CWC MV itself grows from a K-3 to a K-5 program. CWC MV plans to extend its charter to include a middle school as well.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Ample research shows a clear relationship between music instruction and graduation rates, improved test scores, and increased success in mathematics and reading. For example, the Harris Interactive poll of high school principals (Spring 2006) found that schools with music programs have significantly higher graduation rates than do those without programs (90.2% as compared to 72.9%). That same study determined that schools with music programs have significantly higher attendance rates than those without programs (93.3% as compared to 84.9%).

In 2050?": "There are numerous, well known benefits of music instruction to education, including higher graduation rates, increased proficiency in reading and mathematics abilities, and better test scores. However, public schools today struggle with dwindling resources. Musical instruction often falls by the wayside. HEAR LA provides its students with a vibrant music program and uses that program as a platform to renew interest in music instruction that will reverberate throughout Los Angeles.",

Ann O’Leary stated in that article “Our ability to thrive as the world’s ninth largest economy depends on having an educated, healthy and stable next generation of workers.” HEAR LA reaches out to groups of disadvantaged youth by teaching them to use iPad based recording studios, instruments, music education software, and connecting them to a larger International Music Network. HEAR LA will give students the vocabulary and the confidence to become active participants in the music industry, in Los Angeles and in the world. HEAR LA will keep not only students but also Los Angeles relevant in a global world. Funding from LA 2050 will position children of Los Angeles to be global leaders.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "CWC MV and HearMe are ready to implement the HEAR LA program the moment funding is in place.

Investing in incarceration is not a strategy for successful youth. We know that investing in our young people means investing in a successful, safe future for everyone. LA for Youth is a cross-sector, cross-county collaborative aimed at changing the budget priorities of LA County to emphasize youth development. By empowering young people, engaging allies, and working with public agencies, we aim to re-allocate County funds away from suppression to support the development of youth centers, youth jobs, safe public spaces, and increase youth engagement in schools in an effort to make LA a great place to play for everyone.",

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Research, including data collection and analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs and to share lessons learned will be a challenge, as some benchmarks can be subjective. Part of this includes the fact that while achieving the campaign goal is a concrete, measurable outcome, it will take a full year to achieve, so implementation and the results of that success will not be felt until the following year. As a strategy to counteract that, we have included some along-the-way goals to measure successes and accomplishments that will help support the overall objective of creating a Youth Development Department.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By increasing youth awareness of parks and open spaces through youth-driven community asset mapping, we will increase their usage. Additionally, by focusing young people on reclaiming parks as a youth space, we will improve parks and open spaces, and increase youth and family park use. By increasing investment in youth development activities, we will support increased funding for after school programs and activities, which will in turn increase enrollment. As young people are increasingly directed towards after school programs, employment, and community engagement, crime rates should drop. Similarly, by promoting more interaction among community members, by increasing youth investment in their own communities, by increasing awareness of the positive stories of young people, residents will feel increasingly safe in their neighborhoods. Finally, by including inter-generational videos and/or performances as part of our work plan, we will help create opportunities for inter-generational engagement.",

We believe this presents a uniquely powerful combination that will be able to move what's a pretty substantial effort. The core organizing collaboration is between the Youth Justice Coalition (YJC) and the Violence Prevention Coalition (VPC). Youth Justice Coalition did the original research and laid the foundation for this effort. YJC engages and empowers young people to be community organizers and advocates. This project will help leverage their existing work with at-risk youth. Their partnership ensures that youth voices remain at the center of the effort -- a key factor in the success of this collaboration. The Violence Prevention Coalition brings in a broad and diverse membership base, and serves as a non-service-providing neutral body to convene, facilitate, and shepherd this effort (our second and third key factors for the collaboration's success).",

While our overall goal is to create a Department of Youth Development in the County of LA, there are several short- and medium- term goals that will help move the long term campaign forward while also achieving immediate change.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The project will benefit the young people in Los Angeles County, as well as their families, and the communities where they live. By shifting the County's relationship to its youth, by promoting youth investment, LA residents will benefit from healthier, stronger young people who are more engaged in school, more physically active, and more involved with civic institutions.

During the pilot program which ran in Spring 2014, participants showed a 35-50% improvement in their perceptions and performance self-evaluations of STEM subjects as well as a collective improvement in their plans to use STEM in their future careers from 49-67%.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Confirmed collaborators are East Los Angeles College and the Jaime Escalante Math Program which developed the curriculum and the West San Gabriel Valley Boys and Girls Club who successfully facilitated the pilot with six organizations this spring. Additionally, the Los Angeles County Alliance for Boys and Girls Clubs is committed to implementing Seeding STEM for its 26 member organizations throughout the county as part of its STEM initiative (facilitated by lead agency, West San Gabriel Valley Boys and Girls Club). The LACABGC has existed for over ten years and has a track record of county wide events and initiatives designed to bring together the collective strengths of the individual organizations which are independent non-profits with their own governing boards (examples include Youth of the Year, Teen Summit and myriad program and training opportunities). Three factors critical to the success of this collaboration are the commitment of organization leadership in providing the space and staffing for the twelve week program, staff commitment to training (13 hours), and the facilitation of pre and post perception and interest surveys to measure impact.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "We anticipate there being a potential challenge in identifying space for a STEM lab required for the project (many pilot participants converted computer labs into \"STEM\" labs). Additionally staff training could be a challenge for organizations with tight personnel structures and budgets. To overcome these challenges, funding for Seeing STEM includes support for lab supplies and staff training expenses such as overtime and transportation).",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The curriculum was created by East Los Angeles College instructors in alignment with common core standards for a pilot program which ran from February 25 – May 22, 2014 with six LA County Boys and Girls Clubs serving 120 youth. The curriculum and staff training have been recorded and are ready to roll out to all clubs over the course of the 2014-15 school year. Funding will supply staff training, equipment and materials for the project-based learning projects (participants build a motorized toy car with electric gears, gliders that demonstrate the relationship between force and motion, gravity cruisers, and fuel cell vehicles). The West San Gabriel Valley Boys and Girls Club, a LACABGC member organization, will facilitate the training and tracking of program deliverables and participating clubs will be responsible for providing staff, space and 11-14 year old members interested in participating in this transformative engineering design experience. A STEMFest at the end of the twelve week program provides an opportunity for participants to show off their projects with peers and community stakeholders throughout the county.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "Careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) are rapidly on the rise. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce by 2018 STEM jobs will have increased by 17% over ten years as compared to 9.8% growth for non-STEM jobs. In addition, STEM workers tend to earn 26% more than their non-STEM counterparts. Despite all of this growth, as a country, we are failing our youth in terms of preparation for STEM jobs of the future. The United States is ranked 49th in the quality of science and math education and only 16% of American high school seniors are proficient in math and interested in a STEM career. In order for the United States and specifically Los Angeles to remain a global leader there must be a shift to bridge this gap.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Over 500 youth members of Boys and Girls Clubs in Los Angeles County (see list below, 20 members and two facilitating staff per club) will directly benefit from participating in Seeding STEM as will the professional staff and volunteers trained to facilitate the program. Indirectly, the surrounding schools and communities will benefit from engaged kids in the classroom and neighborhood inspiring their peers towards STEM fields of study.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Academic Performance Index scores",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Throughout the course of the next academic year, Boys and Girls Clubs throughout Los Angeles County will be implementing after-school STEM initiatives including Seeding STEM. Because the program is 12 weeks long, it can complement and fit into STEM activities in either the fall, winter or spring.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Seeding STEM is a collaborative education program for middle school aged youth developed by ELAC and the Jaime Escalante Math Program",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Seeding STEM is a collaborative education program for middle school aged Boys and Girls Club members developed by East Los Angeles College and the Jamie Escalante Math Program. Over the course of twelve weeks, 36 instructional hours plus lab time, over 500 11-14 year olds will participate in hands-on, project-based common core complementary STEM curriculum facilitated by trained Boys and Girls Club staff and STEM coaches from ELAC. Participants engage in the Engineering Design Experience, a problem-solving process favored by engineers and design teams across the country. LACABGC will take this successful pilot program which ran this spring with six clubs to all 26 Boys and Girls Club organizations in the county.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will measure our success by pre and post survey outcomes for all participants, participation rates of individuals and member organizations and facilitator (staff and volunteer) reports on the success of the program.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Collaboration is key for greater program impact. Engaging the educational talents and resources of local institutions such as East Los Angeles College and the Jaime Escalante Math Program ensured high quality curriculum serving common core standards."

Residents and employees at participating buildings will feel the benefits most directly, but it will also help achieve the goals of property owners, developers, community development corporations and city leaders. With specific processes, best practices and performance metrics, this project has the potential to elevate the evaluation and implementation of resilience at a range of scales.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The success of our project can be measured by:",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1. Emergency planning is not a sexy topic. Part of the reason that we are not prepared is that people try not to think about, much less plan for, worst-case scenarios. When resources are scarce, resilience will have to compete with other priorities for investment. Green building again provides a good model here. Before the emergence of green building rating systems like LEED or Enterprise Green Communities, it was typically hard to persuade building owners to choose more environmentally responsible approaches when all of the benefits appeared to be external to the project. By helping to articulate not only the environmental benefits but also the tangible benefits to the project (such as cost savings, healthier occupants, or improved public relations), rating systems helped change the conversation. A resilience rating system can do the same. Rather than using fear, guilt or a list of “shoulds,” the LA Resilience Rating System must articulate the many co-benefits of resilience strategies and bundle them in a way that enables market recognition at the same time as verifiable performance. In other words, we can shift the conversation from what we don’t want (disaster) to what we do want (safety, health, connection, resilience), and help people respond from a place of hope, creativity and vision.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The core LA Resilience Rating System will be developed over a one-year period according to the following schedule:",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "USGBC-LA is transforming LA's built environment by supporting sustainability, resiliency, and environmental justice for all.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "While our proposal specifically focuses on the “Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric),” the project has the potential to impact every one of the metrics on the list.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Resilience is the capacity of people, communities and institutions to bounce back to a position of strength, health and vitality after experiencing shocks or stresses. It means more than surviving—it means thriving. The LA Resilience Rating System will encourage and enable building projects to become more resilient in the face of earthquakes, drought, climate change, power outages or other disasters in ways that also improve daily quality of life. By providing leaders in the design, construction and operation of buildings and neighborhoods with a step-by-step process, performance standards and recognition, our work will drive higher standards throughout the industry and create a better LA today.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Imagine Los Angeles after a major earthquake. Experts predict that the biggest risks to LA are the impacts to our aging infrastructure. Broken water pipes, downed power lines and collapsed roads could leave Angelenos without water, power or access to food for days, weeks or months, undermining the very fabric of our city. The more that communities can rely upon alternative sources of water and energy, locally grown food, and connections between neighbors, the better able we will be to survive without outside support in emergencies, and the better our everyday quality of life will be. Our team will develop a rating system that leverages existing resilience toolkits to help decision-makers implement resilience strategies for projects ranging from new construction to existing building operations at the scale of single buildings to entire neighborhoods or campuses.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The US Green Building Council’s LA Chapter (USGBC-LA) will lead this project in collaboration with the Enterprise Community Partners Southern California office and the LA Community College District. USGBC-LA is a non-profit whose mission is to promote sustainability in Southern California’s built environment by delivering access to knowledge, resources, recognition and networking. The USGBC is the nation’s foremost environmental coalition, and innovator of the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Rating System.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Access to healthy food",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. FEMA estimates that $1 in pre-disaster preparedness could save society $4 on post-disaster recovery. Disaster preparedness is cost effective, but can be hard to fund when it is seen as competing with other priorities. Where resources are constrained, as they are on most building projects, it is critical that we demonstrate the direct benefits of resilience strategies. The LA Resilience Rating System will give LA building projects a pathway to get the most out of investments in preparedness. The rating system will provide specific, realistic and cost-effective guidance on developing emergency response plans and processes, as well as fortifying the social and economic fabric of the community, both within and surrounding the project. Our rating system will be flexible, scalable, and designed with sufficient technical rigor to provide actionable direction to projects. Our program must be realistic and achievable, while at the same time moving the needle in measurable ways toward resilience.",

Climate change will bring more drought, more heat waves, bigger storms and rising sea levels, as well as disruptions in agriculture, energy supply and other economic impacts. Add to this our aging infrastructure, rising housing costs and high unemployment. Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy have given us a preview of coming attractions of what can happen in a disaster. Without taking drastic action, LA is at risk. We must prepare for the worst by helping to create the best LA now."

    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We are continuing to implement our project and will be able to achieve much more success now that we own an official Do Good Bus! With 24-hour access to a vehicle equipped with supplies and enough seats for 30 willing volunteers, we have the capability to coordinate last minute trips to help our neighbors in a time of emergency or disaster relief. This might be the most exciting element of owning our own bus. In addition, having a personalized bus on the streets promoting our efforts will help advertise and inspire people with each passing glance.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One major challenge we anticipate is being understaffed. Recently, we have hired a few more freelance bus hosts to accomplish hosting multiple rides in a day. However, these rides are scheduled far in advance and having a few part-time staff doesn’t account for any last minute mishaps. We believe being able to bring on more permanent staff will greatly benefit our efforts and allow for us to do much more GOOD. It will also allow our management team to focus on the future and taking steps toward bigger projects and more opportunities to bring people together.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "With the word spreading about our project, we need funding to keep up with the demand and implement our additional ideas.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Today, there are numerous ways that the Do Good Bus will help make LA the best place to connect. With our busy schedules and hectic lives, taking the time to volunteer and do good by others is not always factored in. Our engaging and unique approach to volunteering truly sets us apart and attracts many Los Angelenos who may have not considered getting involved in their community before.",

By transporting volunteers to causes all over LA and bringing awareness to those causes - we’re collaborating with potentially hundreds of charitable foundations! We saw this first hand this year when Do Good Bus collaborated with No Right Brain Left Behind by bringing multiple groups of volunteers to help complete their LA2050 Grant Project (2013). In addition to No Right Brain Left Behind, some of the causes our project has and will benefit are: MEND Poverty, the LA Food Bank, Best Friends Animal Society, EnrichLA and so many more.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "We’ve learned a lot over the past four years working with causes, clients and volunteers. The most important lesson we’ve learned (and one of the reasons we started the Do Good Bus) is a lot of people WANT to volunteer but they don’t know where to start. They are overwhelmed with how many causes are out there and could use a little guidance on where to begin. Do Good Bus has visited causes all over the US and seen how they operate and what types of causes are good for people who may be volunteering for the first time. Our team works hard to use this knowledge to curate causes that will be a good fit for these first-timers and also create an environment where they can connect with other people on the bus.",

Here at the Do Good Bus, we deliver an exciting and engaging opportunity to get involved with your community and to do GOOD in the city of Los Angeles. Each trip is different and the location/cause is kept a secret until we arrive. We currently host a monthly community ride to give Los Angelenos the opportunity to learn about local causes, experience giving back and most importantly, connect with other people in their city. Over the past three years, we’ve visited dozens of causes and connected hundreds of volunteers and are proud to say each passenger left feeling accomplished and connected to one another.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Rate of volunteerism - The Do Good Bus will make the largest impact in this category and our returning clients are evidence of that.

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Although the teens involved with the Center and chapter groups have experience working in the outdoors and creating conservation projects, identifying and cataloging birds in the field takes additional expertise. Identifying plant habitat also requires a level of experience that these teens are not likely to have. This is why we’re including Audubon chapters (including those based in Los Angeles that do not have teen groups) in this project, so that they can not only provide direct assistance to the teens in the field, but also share their knowledge of local birds and habitat as well. We are also excited about the richness that this project will develop by connecting young people with older chapter members, creating some generational continuity.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "This is project can be implemented quickly because all of the organizations involved have experience doing similar projects, and have the infrastructure in place to get started right away. The Audubon Center at Debs Park, Los Angeles Audubon, and Palos Verdes/South Bay Audubon already have teen groups in place that are doing conservation projects and nature programs in their communities. Each organization already has professional staff guiding the work of these youth groups, as well as the organizational infrastructure in place to operate these programs (insurance, human resources, legal advice, etc.). The Audubon Center at Debs Park and the Audubon chapters all have established bird monitoring protocols to employ, and larger communications and program support that will help the teens amplify their work to larger audiences.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Teens from across Los Angeles will teach us how birds connect us to wild nature in Los Angeles city parks.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Audubon will bring young people from across the city together with their broader communities to highlight the connection between people and the wild nature that exists in Los Angeles city parks. These youth will show that our parks play a much more important role in the health of our communities that we could have imagined. This will be accomplished by identifying the birds in our city parks and sharing this knowledge with the public– using video, social media, community programming, and good old-fashioned word of mouth. WildLAparks will create new park stewards, committed to sharing, protecting, and enjoying the wildlife of Los Angeles’ city parks.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "Audubon youth will help people gain a better understanding and appreciation of nature in their urban parks, the value of native plants, water conservation, wildlife and habitat preservation. We will connect people of all ages to the great outdoors in recreational activities and fun restoration/conservation events and show that nature in LA thrives!",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 PLAY metrics?": "Access to open space and park facilities",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This project has a few target audiences. First the project will benefit teens that are involved in our after-school programs. These programs provide a pathway to higher educational and career opportunities for under-served youth. The Audubon Center at Debs Park program serves youth primarily from northeast Los Angeles communities. Students are predominantly Latino, ages 12-18. Audubon YES participants consist of both middle and high school students from throughout the South Bay. High School student interns in Los Angeles Audubon’s Greenhouse & Environmental Stewardship Program are from Dorsey High whose student body identifies as 57% African-American and 42% Hispanic. All of these programs serve economically disadvantaged youth. Nearly all the graduates from these programs go on to four-year colleges, and many are the first in their families to do so.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The Audubon network in Los Angeles, embodied by the Audubon Center at Debs Park, Los Angeles Audubon, and Palos Verdes/South Bay Audubon have found that (1) people in Los Angeles love the outdoors and love their parks and that (2) parks are even more of a contributor to a great quality of life when we realize and see all of the other creatures who love our parks as much as we do.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "•\tSafe parks = safe neighborhoods – our experience has shown that increased programming in parks leads to re-invigorated community spaces. These outcomes have ripple effects in the communities and lead to overall well-being.",

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "When budgets are cut, those without a voice in government are the hardest hit. Foster youth are the most vulnerable Angelenos because the foster care system is overburdened. The hard working, well-intentioned folks working on their behalf have neither the time nor the means to develop, produce and execute a nuanced strategy to recruit their ideal candidates for foster parents and mentors. More than 150,000 child abuse investigations were launched in the county last year alone. Working with limited resources, we want and need the county’s social workers focused on one thing: the safety of all our kids.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Foster youth, living at the mercy of an overburdened system, have been robbed of their promise in Los Angeles County. From lower preschool enrollment to lower high school graduation rates, you would be hard-pressed to find a group of kids more challenged in our schools. It is our intent that two successful programs will benefit from FosterMore’s efforts to increase awareness of foster youth and provide opportunities to get involved with them.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "FosterMore has currently developed storyboards and several concepts for videos and content creation. By the end of August 2014, we will have tested each concept in focus groups and scored likely messages for impact. Our plan is to develop the video and online content by September for an October launch.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The reason people hold such negative views of foster youth is because they only hear about the negative stories. Many children who have been in foster care are now thriving, successful adults. Doctors, lawyers, social workers, and teachers have spent time in state care. Reintroducing Angelenos to their neighbors who spent time in foster care is the first step toward eliminating the stigmas associated with foster care. This challenge will be met through intensive focus groups and a battery of online testing of advertisements and messages. The FosterMore coalition will use much of the grant to purchase online ads to drive the campaign in a series of waves.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "Only 5 percent of foster youth are proficient in math and only 20 percent in English. Housing the largest population of foster youth in the state and second largest in the nation, we must do something now!",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "FosterMore will serve as the lead for the project. FosterMore is a coalition of nonprofit organizations and foundations united to increase opportunities for youth in foster care. Lead funding and strategic partners include, Casey Family Programs, The Entertainment Industry Foundation, Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Anthony & Jeanne Pritzker Family Foundation, Stuart Foundation and Youth Villages. The effort is directed by co-founders, Jennifer Perry, Executive Director of the Children’s Action Network and David Ambroz, Director, Corporate Citizenship and Social Responsibility, Disney-ABC Television Group. Managing the effort is Mark Daley, of Propper Daley, A Social Impact Agency.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Our research has informed us that the greatest challenge facing foster parent recruitment are the negative stigmas associated with youth in care. A common misperception held by individuals is that the youth in care are “damaged” or “broken.” In order to convince our neighbors to open their homes and their hearts to a child in need, we must first change the way they view foster youth. Continuing with the positive messaging of FosterMore, our content will showcase the potential of foster youth and former foster youth and present opportunities to help change the life of kid experience tough times.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Research shows many Angelenos hold negative opinions about foster youth. Foster youth are seen as “broken” kids. This stigma has had a real impact on recruitment efforts. Last year, LA County’s foster parent shortage was at a “crisis” level.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "FosterMore will recruit volunteers, mentors and foster parents to improve the outcomes for foster youth in Los Angeles",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Last August The Los Angeles Times reported the county’s shortage of foster care beds had reached “a crisis point.” At that time “officials acknowledged they don’t have enough personnel to promptly feed children or change diapers.”",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "District-wide graduation rates",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The project will evaluate its impact utilizing several criteria including but not limited to, leads generated through online click-throughs, leads that are generated with through phone calls and in-person meetings and those who successfully navigate the process to become certified foster parents. In addition, we will look at the number of children placed in homes of those recruited by the effort."

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "The Sabio Crossroads Creative Tech Cohort will make Los Angeles the best place to create 12 months following our LA2050 Challenge Grant because it will produce exceptionally well trained web creators, that are also ethnically diverse, which match the cultural fabric of the City. Once this Creative Tech program is launched, lessons will be learned, the Fellows will be out in the workforce collaborating with various media professionals, and contributing to the growing knowledge base of the program, and the program will be scaled to serve hundreds of other diverse Fellows throughout the City.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Sabio has learned that the selection process can prove to be challenging. Our current educational system, and overall popular culture, has not fully embraced the notion that everyone, and anyone, can become a tech creator. Everyone has a Facebook and or Instagram account, but few understand what HTML is and or does, and how it is what allows billions of us to connect online, via our mobile devices, and or desktop computers. Therefore, we anticipate there might be some reluctance on the part of the Crossroads clients to want to sign-up for this type of training. However, we are going to work hard to inform individuals about the great job prospects in the tech and creative sectors so that we may get many qualified and motivated candidates.",

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "South LA",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Lesson #1 – Sabio has successfully proven its thesis: Anyone, from any background, given the correct resources, guidance, and time, can learn to become a fantastic full-time, entry-level web programmer that will be hired by a company at a competitive salary. Although technical bootcamps have been around for about five years, an overwhelming majority of them required that individuals have working knowledge of code, and or have some prior tech work experience before they could apply and become a bootcamp program participant. The Sabio Founders, Gregorio Rojas and Liliana Monge, theorized that no such prior technical education and experience was in fact needed to become a successful web developer. The reason why the Sabio Founders did not want to make a tech requirement a part of their LA-based program was because they understood that very few low-income Latinos and African Americans would have such qualifications; therefore, they would not be able to properly train a representative sample of Angelenos. Instead of requiring tech experience, they devised an intake process that allowed them to identify individuals that were highly motivated and determined to become entry-level web programmers. And their thesis was correct. In the fall of 2013 Sabio did in fact identify individuals that were smart, driven, highly motivated, and dedicated. They took those individuals and empowered them with 500 hours of the most up-to-date tech resources, exposed them to industry professionals, competed in a HackforLA Hackathon, prepared them for job interviews, and by the Spring of 2014, all were employed as full-stack web developers in fantastic companies throughout the Los Angeles region.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The Sabio Crossroads leadership is exceptionally certain it can implement the Creative Tech Training Program within twelve months of receiving an award, because it already has the infrastructure needed to implement the proposed three phased program: 1) intake; 2) intensive tech training; 3) case management & follow-up.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Creative Tech Training program was specifically designed to serve African American Latino and young adults, ages 18 – 35, both male and female, that have either dropped out of high school, and or have a non-violent criminal record, with the objective of creating transformational creative-tech creators that will have the power to not only tell amazing stories via film, but will also have the technical chops to put that transformative content online, accessible to millions of other young and impressionable South LA youth, teens and adults, who are looking for narratives that empower and reframe their realities.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Three separate groups will benefit as a result of the LA2050 Grant Challenge Grant: 1) Six Latino and African American Creative Tech Fellows (clients of Crossroads), 2) Sabio, and 3) SoCalCrossroads,.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Both Crossroads and Sabio are organizations that are deeply rooted in the local Los Angeles community, and have cultivated a number of key-strategic partnership throughout their tenure, and are eager to collaborate with other organizations also looking to make a positive impact on the lives of young adults."

Two studies in particular explain the positive correlation between beautifying the urban environment and (1) the health and well-being of its inhabitants and (2) their attachment to the community, both of which lead directly to significant economic growth.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Beautify Earth will use a project timeline replete with benchmarks, milestones, and deliverables for its employees, volunteers, and stakeholders that will keep the project on track and ensure its deadlines are met. Having created 40 murals in the past year, we have already established policies and procedures for optimum outcomes, and we have refined and documented the many steps necessary to accomplish our goals.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Beautify Earth’s vision is to create 50 murals in one year throughout South Los Angeles, initially targeting 3 neighborhoods: Crenshaw, Central Avenue/84th Street and La Brea/Slauson. One potential project includes a space large enough to accommodate several murals along with art structures and can be used to host community events, workshops, classes and even an outdoor café or farmer’s market.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "All Beautify projects begin with location scouting, followed by outreach to building or wall owners. Once the owner is identified and approves the project, Beautify’s volunteer artists develop an artistic concept and rendering.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Our work is collaborative in nature. We bring together artists, community members, businesses, employees, property owners, government officials, their staff and other government workers, and philanthropic sources to volunteer time and/or donate goods, services or funds for mural painting, street fairs, arts education, outreach and other community-building activities that increase connections between people of varied races, backgrounds, interests, and socioeconomic groups.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Beautify Earth proposes a partnership with urban planning students from local universities, including Antioch University Los Angeles’s graduate program in Urban Planning, to design an assessment tool that measures the impact of the murals on the surrounding community through interaction with passersby and local residents.

    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Beautify’s murals serve as vehicles of business improvement and community pride and inspire a connection to one’s neighborhood, one’s history and oneself. Murals give residents, business owners and passersby ways to identify neighborhoods, and serve as community gathering places. The creation and placement of murals has an immediate effect on the daily lives of Los Angeles residents and businesses. The process of the community coming together to create and support each mural starts building connections between neighbors even before the mural is created.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "This project will directly benefit and impact local residents, business owners and artists in South Los Angeles. While the immediate effects are improved community pride and a sense of inspiration and transformation, Beautify’s efforts develop the local economy by improving local business revenue, attracting new investment and generating interest for tourists and visitors. This in turn leads to job creation across multiple industries and sectors. We will be helped in these efforts by our collaborators, which include two non-profits that focus on economic development and a local marketing firm that hosts an internet talk show with 300,000 monthly viewers.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Through outreach, painting murals and providing food and fun, we will engage community members who traditionally do not volunteer. As we create projects throughout the region, we will greatly increase rates of volunteerism. Community members will experience the benefits of volunteering, which will encourage them to volunteer for other efforts. Involving the community, engaging the neighborhood councils as collaborators and involving other local community organizations will show people how they can make a difference in their community.",

Respectively, they bring a host of high-quality medical care; early care and early intervention services; and food pantry, housing support and homelessness support to our shared clients. All of the families who come to WIN are referred from our three partners, and that allows us to ‘nest’ our intensive mental health care within the context of their home-agencies services. WIN’s partnership relationships are some of the most deeply rooted we’ve encountered, and are critical to our success with families.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Access to healthy food",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "WIN is an ongoing project, and since launching in 2006, WIN has annually met and/or exceeded its goals. WIN’s highly trained, bilingual therapy staff, as well as partner agency case managers trained by WIN, work in-home with families identified by our partner agencies using a combination of: 1) child-parent dyadic therapy, 2) adult individual therapy for parents, and/or 3) intensive, in-home, cross-agency case management for basic needs, to meet clinical and life goals established by families to ensure that their children are able to thrive in safe, nurturing homes. WIN will use its deep, collaborative infrastructure to ensure that all partners are working together with families to deliver seamless health, mental health, social services and early education such that families can make real, substantive gains.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Risks & Limitations: As demonstrated above, WIN is effective at increasing childhood developmental-educational and child-parent attachment outcomes for families that receive a year or more of child-parent psychotherapy. However, the long-term effectiveness of our work may be limited by the following factors:",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "WIN targets low-income families with children prenatal through three who are facing attachment issues across 26 Los Angeles Country zip codes from Inglewood to Hollywood, Venice to West LA. Annually, our intensive clinical program serves 350-400 individual children, parents and family members who are facing critical challenges (approximately 75-90 families). All (100%) of our clients are from low income families across 26 local zip codes including Inglewood and Mar Vista. Of current WIN clients, 83% are Latino (most are recent immigrants from Mexico and Central America who speak Spanish or indigenous languages); 2% are multiracial (Asian/African American/Latino); 5% are Caucasian; 8% are African American; and 2% have other ethnic backgrounds). We typically work with families for 12-18 months—and the process is an intensive one. Our consultation program provides 700 hours of direct service to 125-150 staff of 5 agencies in LA to affect the lives of 1000s of additional children and families annually.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Because WIN integrates its mental heath services with the health, social services, food and housing support, and early care and early intervention services of its three agency partners, WIN families are connected with a medical home and get integrated mental health care (in-home!). We work to ensure families are securely housed, receive food support, and that families have the skills and resources they need to shield their kids from abuse and neglect. Because families are deeply connected to WIN and our partners, even after goals are met, families can reconnect with WIN at any time if they face a crisis, need supplementary resources--or would just like reassurance and support as they raise their children.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Our goals for children and families are based on substantial data demonstrating that children who are securely attached to their parents and caregivers are happier, healthier and do better in school, work and life over the long-term. WIN’s program goals are as follows: 1) children will be securely attached to their parents/caregivers; 2) if children enter with developmental delays, we will see substantial improvement; 3) parents will feel less stress and more competence in their roles as parents; 4) our network will proactively link families to the basic services they need to stabilize and improve their lives such that our therapy can be more effective; 5) and staff throughout the WIN network will be better able to identify, refer and provide services for families who are in need. We evaluate our work using the following indicators:",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "At WIN, we make psychotherapy house calls to kids and parents who are dealing with multiple traumas and poverty during the most critical point of brain development in the human lifespan. We coordinate our mental health therapy with the food, health care, early intervention and other services of our 3 partner agencies so families recover in a “nest” of integrated care. And it works: our kids overcome developmental delays, families have measurably stronger relationships, and our parents and less stressed and depressed. Plus, WIN provides over 700 hours of professional consultation to agencies throughout LA so they can better help families thrive--and we have an ongoing project with Harvard to create better outcomes for kids nationwide.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Through it's therapy and consultation work WIN affects the lives of 1000s of individuals yearly, and the core of our program is our intensive clinical work: WIN will provide in-home, dyadic child-parent psychotherapy and individual therapy for parents along with integrated health, early care/education and social services through our referring partner agencies to 350-400 children, parents and family members annually. Our bilingual, master’s-level therapists will work with young children (prenatal through 3+) and parents whose relationships have been disrupted by trauma, neglect and mental illness to affect substantive, measurable improvement in 1) secure attachment, 2) children’s social, emotional and cognitive development, and 3) parental stress. While WIN therapists provide these direct services, our partner agency case managers ensure that families get intensive, cross-agency early care, social services and health clinic support before and throughout the therapeutic process, such that unmet basic needs don’t interrupt treatment. We will manage the entire network of services in “real time” via WIN’s innovative communications infrastructure and web-based data system to make sure families facing substantial challenges get what they need, when they need it, without the service barriers of an agency working in isolation, and without the “red tape” typical of cross-agency collaborations. Along with these services, WIN will help families build relationships and social networks though our monthly Family Night gatherings. And, in order to positively affect the lives of children and families beyond the geographic reach of our direct services, we will also provide professional-level early childhood mental health training to clinicians and providers throughout LA County, and mental health consultation to Early Head Start programs and other agencies, including Venice Family Clinic, Westside Children’s Center, El Nido Family Center, Pediatric Therapy Center and St. Joseph Center.",

But untreated, impacts can be far more pernicious and entrenched, developing into lifetimes of mental and physical illness, behavior and educational problems, with root causes deeply embedded in brain structures and chemistry. And children who have experienced early childhood trauma and adversity, the primary cause of early mental health issues, are three to fifty times more likely, depending on the severity and types of trauma, to develop severe mental health issues like psychosis, borderline personality disorder and paranoid schizophrenia than the general population—diagnoses that have been linked to recent tragedies around the country.

It seemed daunting at times, but she quickly learned how to get better with each step, \"I started with a Craigslist ad for a $50 table saw and a ton of YouTube clips. I’ve been learning every day since. Whenever I can, I surround myself with people who are more skilled, more knowledgeable, and I ask a lot of questions. I have found that if you are pleasant and genuine, people who love their craft often love to share it with others.\" (quote from recent Darling interview http://darlingmagazine.org/the-dreamer-embodied-fort/) From this experience she realized a need for mixing the experienced with the inexperienced. The experienced makers will lead the workshops teaching those less knowledgable, and the inexperienced workshopper's excitement will fuel the instructors reminding them of the joys of their craft. Both parties have so much to offer one another.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "As a growing business it is critical to have a strategic plan to measure success. FORT uses a well-known tool: OKRs. The system made famous first by Intel and now by Google asks all employees to outline their major objectives and the quantifiable actions it'll take to achieve them. It’s a technique designed for accountability and enforced with scores.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "FORT plans to expand its current operation and launch Resident Maker Programs (complete with DIY workshops, 3D Printing & Ted-like talks).",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "•\tThe children of the Salamander Project (last year's recipient of LA 2050) as well as youth from other underserved communities will learn skills and explore their creative potentials through free workshops from FORT.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "FORT (Resident Makers Program) will impact several of the above metrics and below we have highlighted a few:",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Because FORT is already an existing workshop/retail we already have that side of the model in place. That is a huge foundation to begin from. We plan to launch the Resident Maker's Program and that we have extensive networks and social media outlets to garner support from. Jacqueline Sharp (FORT founder) is a part of AMEX's CEO Bootcamp network, a Tory Burch Foundation Alumni, a Goldman Sach's 10,000 Small Businesses Alumni and has many other local organizations she's worked with as well. These networks will assist in the marketing of this program and recruitment of entreprenuers. Build out of a space will take a relatively short amount of time as a workshop takes little glitz, glam, or cosmetic transforming. We mostly need machines and shelving for materials. Building out this new and improved website which includes a Marketplace for our Resident Makers will take an estimated 3 months. Recruiting various community organizers from all over the city will take a few months and a lot of planning. We want to collaborate with local community organizers to optimize the benefits of 'Popping' in to give our workshops. All in all the project will be fully operational with in 8 months time.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "FORT currently operates as a small business with a smaller customer base. We anticipate some growing pains especially in the operations department of scaling up. We have already connected with operations management consultants and found one that would be perfect for the job! She has ten years of experience in both non-profit and for profit. She loves the concept behind FORT and is excited to work with us if given the opportunity. We would hire her for the onset of this new operation so that she could give us her expertise in this area.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "At FORT we want to take the feeling of community, construction, creativity, and design, which we innately held in our adolescence (building forts), and use it to empower and reinvigorate the Los Angeles population as a whole. We have accomplished this on a small scale out of our workshop in DTLA, but are ready to take it to the broader community. Through our Resident Maker Program, local residents will learn from the best, refine their ideas, and launch their creative products through FORT. Resident Makers will agree to give workshops themselves a ‘pay it forward’ like fashion. Because of this crucial feature, the Maker community can be self-generating, viral, and scalable, thus increasing and magnifying its social impact.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Currently FORT operates as a company that leverages reclaimed materials to create beautiful pieces of furniture. We also host DIY workshops, where community members learn from prominent artists/makers, make goods from reclaimed materials, and organize monthly events focused on community and design. Our inventory is available through our website and by appointment. FORT would like to evolve this established base into a new creative paradigm for social impact, empowering Los Angeles and creative industries/businesses at large.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "It is the age-old adage, “Give a man a fish…teach a man to fish...” Through the reverberating effects of our Resident Makers selling their products and acquiring the tools to become entrepreneurs themselves, FORT will facilitate an environment in which creatives can flourish in Los Angeles for years to come. In exchange for the platform to learn, refine, and launch their creative products through FORT, Makers will agree to give workshops themselves in a ‘pay it forward’ like fashion. Many of such workshops will be given in a pop-up like fashion in underserved areas of LA. This feature will grant children from struggling communities activities that will allow them to explore creative potentials. We will show them that through the usage of reclaimed materials they too can build and create things with very little to start.",

As mentioned above, we are both working tirelessly towards improving educational outcomes for students in our city. While targeting two schools in LAUSD that have lower-than-average graduation rates, we know that if we can improve the performance of the students and increase the number of students graduating from Roosevelt and Jordan, we can move the needle on the graduation rates in our district.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "City Year LA and Partnership for LA Schools have already agreed on the deployment of City Year corps members at Jordan and Roosevelt High Schools over the next 12 months. Meetings between City Year LA’s program leadership and the schools’ administration have been going on for several months and conditions for success and program goals have already been determined. Thanks to the efforts of its Recruitment and Admissions team, City Year LA has already recruited and begun training the AmeriCorps members who will be serving at the two schools starting on the first LAUSD instructional day.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "City Year LA and Partnership for LA Schools will build on our successful partnership by expanding to Roosevelt HS and Jordan HS.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Every 26 seconds a young person in America gives up on school. The high school dropout crisis is enormous in scope, yet highly concentrated in just a few neighborhoods like Watts and Boyle Heights. City Year LA and Partnership for LA Schools are working together to help at-risk students reach their full potential by expanding our longtime collaboration into two of LA’s most historically challenged high schools, Jordan and Roosevelt. City Year corps members will be deployed to work with 9th grade students, targeting those who are demonstrating risk factors for dropping out, providing more capacity to Partnership staff and school leadership to implement their vision for the schools’ transformation.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Over the last six years, City Year LA and Partnership for LA Schools have worked together to bring additional supports to our city’s most at-risk students.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Part of the strength of our collaboration is that both of our organizations greatly value a data-driven approach to our work and a strong sense of accountability. City Year LA focuses its measurement on the subset of students it serves, while the Partnership tracks data for all 15,000 students in its network, looking at individual, grade-level and overall gains. Our outcomes are linked – if the lowest-performing population shows increases, it will elevate the entire school’s performance and improve the Partnership network results. As the Los Angeles Unified School District is transitioning to Common Core Standards, some student level testing has been suspended for the coming year. To measure student performance in the absence of standardized tests, City Year will implement the Scholastic Inventories with the students it serves to track their academic outcomes, while the Partnership will use performance growth data from benchmark exams in math and literacy.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "One major lesson that has informed both of our organizations is that the status quo is not enough for students coming from high poverty communities. The schools where we serve have struggled for decades and generations of students have been lost. We know that even a great teacher and lesson each day is not sufficient to overcome the challenges associated with poverty and violence, especially when the majority of the class may need additional attention for a variety of reasons. Students need comprehensive support to help get them to grade level; attend school regularly when they may be responsible for siblings or older family members; become proficient in English; learn about college and the associated benefits; and more. The combined resources of our two organizations help students get the additional support they need so they can focus on that great lesson, and have the skills and tools to advance in school.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "East LA",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "As stated above, City Year and Partnership for LA Schools have worked closely together for a number of years. Both organizations serve schools and neighborhoods where students are at the greatest risk for dropping out. Our models complement one another, and expansion to Jordan and Roosevelt is the continuation of a successful partnership at elementary, middle, and other high schools in LA.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "The recent “Building a Grad Nation” report published by Civic Enterprises, the Everyone Graduates Center, America’s Promise Alliance, and the Alliance for Excellent Education, shows that for the first time in our nation’s history, the high school graduation rate is over 80%--and we are on pace to reach the goal of a 90% graduation rate by 2020. But the report also states that the 90% graduation rate is not possible without more progress in California—home to 20% of the nation’s dropouts.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "In LA, approximately 23,000 students dropped out in 2013, one of the highest totals of any city in the country. For a single young adult such a fate can be tragic, but when the near majority of students from entire neighborhoods fail to graduate, the social and economic costs are profound and far reaching. At Jordan High School only 51% of students graduated in 2013, and the 2013 graduation rate at Roosevelt High School was 60%.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "District-wide graduation rates",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The upcoming school year will be a challenging year for schools and educators across the country as the new Smarter Balanced Common Core assessment is implemented. We have already taken steps to prepare for the new assessment and the potential shift in teaching and learning that will occur. Additionally, the new standardized tests will only begin to set a benchmark for schools as they implement it in consecutive years, and will not provide useful data for assessing students this current school year. To account for this transitional period, City Year will be assessing the students it serves through its Scholastic Reading and Math Inventories system. Both of these tests are computer-based and give students an early chance to adjust to that computer-based testing that will soon be required in schools. The tests also gather data in real time, allowing staff to supply corps members with the content and coaching they need to inform their interventions, and be more deliberate with their in-class service. This data is also useful to teachers and school administrators as they assess how students are progressing."

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Once we have secured our space, we plan to create a report at the 12th month comparing:",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "LESSON ONE: The Challenge of Sharing Space. We have been regular paying tenants of theatre/club spaces for the past 9 years. As long as we are paying tenants, we are never totally “at home.” Our costumes cannot stay overnight without risking damage or loss. We arrive at the space and must improvise with what we find or don’t find that day. Our spaces are often used as music/nightclub venues in the evenings, and we often have to deal with the remnants - a less-than-ideal environment for young people! We have become flexible, great at compromising, community minded, and incredibly responsible in caring for another’s space. Sometimes, we have had to wake up maintenance staff to let us in the space at the agreed times, while we wait with 26 of our students on the street. We have learned that we deserve to move to a new level at this stage in the company, and we believe that the appropriate next step is for Los Angeles Drama Club to have its own space."

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "We believe in the potential of each and every one of our corps members to have a profound impact on their students’ lives, and we have learned from the growing body of external research that affirms this belief. External studies have shown that students in Teach For America corps members’ classrooms are making stronger gains in vocabulary and early math skills than students in non-Teach For America classrooms. A study conducted by Westat, Inc. found that pre-K students taught by Teach For America teachers learned to recognize all or most of the 26 letters of the alphabet, compared with students who were taught by non-Teach For America teachers and learned an average of 10 letters. This is such an important achievement since recognizing letters is a vital steppingstone on the path to reading.

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "We are directly impacting students by recruiting and supporting high-quality preschool teachers and thus far, our program has demonstrated significant improvements in early vocabulary and math skills for our youngest students. Ample research has shown that access to high-quality preschool teachers has many longer-term benefits. Students who attended preschool are significantly more likely to score proficient or advanced in English and mathematics; less likely to be suspended or expelled from primary and secondary school; more than 20% more likely to graduate high school; and more likely to attend and graduate from college. Adults who attended preschool are also much more likely to maintain full-time employment and earn higher salaries; more likely to live healthier lives; and less likely to receive welfare assistance or commit any crimes.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "As we work to grow our cohort, we are very sensitive to the additional challenges faced by our corps members in preschool classrooms. When our corps members are admitted into our program, we commit to identifying a placement for them that pays a minimum salary of $34,000. However, our pre-K teachers often do not have salaries that align with our promised baseline salary because ECE teachers on the whole are typically paid $5,000 to $10,000 less each year than their peers in elementary and secondary schools. We work hard to fundraise to cover this salary differential in order to ensure that our pre-K corps members can focus on the hard work required to lead their young students on a path toward success. In the 2014-15 school year, we need to raise nearly $20,000 to cover this salary differential, every dollar of which will be disbursed to our ECE corps members. A portion of the LA2050 funds will go towards supplementing our ECE corps members’ salaries.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Without high-quality preschool teachers, children from low-income communities enter kindergarten already behind their peers in more affluent communities, and this gap only widens with time. Teach For America is committed to providing the youngest students living in low-income communities in Los Angeles with an excellent education, setting them up for success in the classroom, and leading them to a better future. While we have been supporting Early Childhood Education (ECE) at a smaller scale since 2006, we are looking to expand our efforts dramatically to meet the high demand for qualified, passionate pre-K teachers in Los Angeles, and we want to bring our ECE teachers, whom we refer to as corps members, to the students who need them most.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "By bringing in and supporting highly committed and effective ECE teachers, Teach For America – Los Angeles is playing a pivotal role in the trajectory of Los Angeles’ young students’ education, shaping their initial understanding of what it means to be a successful student and an active member of a learning community. Teaching in some of the highest-need communities in Los Angeles, our ECE corps members will serve over 300 students and their families each day in the 2014-15 school year. The beneficiaries of our work are verified through their qualification for the federal free- and reduced-price lunch program. Children from families with incomes at or below 185% of the poverty level (which equates to $43,568 for a family of four in 2014) are eligible for reduced-price or free meals. Over 95% of the students we serve on a daily basis are eligible for this program. We currently estimate that 60 to 80% of the students we serve are Latino, and 20 to 40% are African American.",

In many classrooms, like May Webster’s, we see even more dramatic growth. May, a 2010 Los Angeles corps member, taught preschool in Lennox, and was selected as Preschool Teacher of the Year by Los Angeles Universal Preschool. May was able to achieve 1.66 levels of growth in her classroom and overcome the statistics predicting that students from low-income backgrounds will enter kindergarten already 12 – 14 months behind their wealthier peers. With May’s leadership and passion, her students started kindergarten already reading at a first-grade level."

    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Generation Empathy® program is a collaborative effort by spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club, to allow educators to increase empathy, thereby preventing violence, by offering a pro-hero, anti-bullying curriculum in the classroom, based on spcaLA’s award-winning Teaching Love and Compassion (TLC) ™ program.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Partner organizations primarily serve the Boyle Heights community of Los Angeles. Demographically, Boyle Heights is a primarily Latino (approximately 94%), young (median age 30 years) neighborhood. Residents have an increased likelihood not to have completed high school, and more of the community lives below the poverty level, as compared to rest of Los Angeles. Further, the area reports a higher-than-average rate of violent crime. The initial target population for Generation Empathy® will be a few groups of students at Salesian Boys & Girls Club. Then, after pilot testing, the target population will potentially grow to the 1,350 students in Volunteers of America Head Start programs (ages 3-5), 200 students in St. Mary’s and Resurrection schools (K-8), and 3,000 students in “After the Bell” at Roosevelt High School. Generation Empathy® can be further offered to school districts, early education centers, clubs and other institutions locally and nationally."

    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Our team has performed extensive research on the needs of local government agencies in their public information and communications efforts. We have successfully translated this research into the development of the MassKnowtify platform to create what is currently available to local governments and citizens.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Solo actor (just us on this project!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "MassKnowtify is currently in a limited release in Los Angeles and we have already partnered with local agencies to bring them on board. Our current web app is fully functional and accessible on all devices (smartphones, tablets, desktop browsers); however, our next milestone in our roadmap is to launch “native” apps for both iOS and Android operating systems to deliver better performance and reliability. Most importantly, access and use of MassKnowtify by citizens is completely FREE.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We view each and every local government in the greater LA region as a partner with MassKnowtify. While we already have several local partners which have expressed interest in using and leveraging MassKnowtify in their public communications efforts, we are not identifying any specific partners in the context of this grant application to order to ensure maximum, yet equitable, opportunity for local governments to partner with MassKnowtify in our efforts going forward.",

    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "MassKnowtify is dedicated to making communications between government and citizens more accessible, valuable, and effective. MassKnowtify solves distinct problems for both citizens and local governments: citizens can be connected to important localized information wherever they travel; local governments can increase citizen communication and engagement in a more direct and cost-effective manner. To achieve this, MassKnowtify provides a location-based public alerting platform to disseminate a variety of public alerts and notifications that are timely, accurate, and relevant to one’s specific location. MassKnowtify functions primarily as a mobile application but can also be accessed through the web from anywhere on any device.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Median travel time to work",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "We’ve conducted extensive research on how local governments connect with their citizens, and the gaps that limit effective citizen communication and engagement. We’ve discovered two key lessons from our work: 1) local governments have a difficult time connecting directly with significant portions of their constituencies, and 2) citizens are increasingly demanding more accessible and effective ways to receive information from local governments that impacts their daily quality of life.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "There are 88 separate municipalities in Los Angeles County, each responsible for providing individual city services (police, fire, public works, etc.) through individual agencies within the municipality. For example, as one drives along Santa Monica Boulevard through West Los Angeles, one will have traveled through the cities of Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and West Hollywood all in under 7 miles. These circumstances make it difficult for a citizen to know which city agencies are responsible for emergency notifications and other essential city services. There are several other large clusters of cities throughout LA County—such as in the South Bay, San Gabriel Valley, and Southeast Los Angeles—with identical circumstances which present challenges for citizens to be connected to timely and geographically relevant information.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "MassKnowtify is a platform designed to benefit everyone in Los Angeles—residents, visitors, business owners, tourists—by connecting them to local government information that is timely and relevant to their specific location.

    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Providence will partner with 6 LA County elementary schools that have never had COPA, serve children who live in lower-income communities, have high rates of childhood obesity, and that don’t currently offer systematic implementation of Physical Education. Two partners are confirmed - John F. Kennedy School in Artesia (part of the ABC Unified School District) and Robin Samana, Director of Elementary and K-8 Schools at the Long Beach Unified School District to identify schools in the LBUSD. We are in discussions with additional schools to confirm more sites. The “added benefit” that the participating schools will bring is that they are ready and willing to make a change within their school to improve student health.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Through this project we will serve 150 elementary school classroom teachers and 3,650 students. Our evaluation to show success consists of a teacher survey and a PE School Assessment, as described below:",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Students’ enthusiasm for COPA PE is an eye-opener for teachers. They are able to interact with their students in a different, more relaxed setting than the classroom – through play! COPA means no one is waiting in lines and everyone has a piece of equipment, so there are fewer behavioral issues, which equates to higher motivation for both students and teachers. COPA is a positive PE experience for all.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Proposed collaboration (we want to work with partners!)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Decades ago, parents felt safe letting their children run freely in their neighborhoods, being active for hours before being called inside for dinner. That was the norm. Today, it simply isn’t happening. Right now, many if not most urban public elementary school children in LA County are NOT getting a chance to be active. In the communities COPA targets, parents just don’t feel safe having their kids run freely in their neighborhoods. On top of that, their children’s schools have cut their PE budgets, so children really can go days before they participate in any kind of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1.\tSecuring 4 additional school sites. To overcome this challenge we have already started the dialogue with potential school sites. If we win the competition, we are also able to offer the program at no cost to the school district, which is appealing to interested schools. We expect that if awarded, we will have identified all of the 6 school sites and be ready to launch.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "COPA will change Physical Education in elementary schools across Los Angeles County. COPA is not the old-school style of PE that requires kids to do jumping jacks, sit-ups, and makes kids who are not so athletic feel ashamed and embarrassed when picked last. No, instead COPA welcomes kids of all ability levels and gets classrooms of kids and their teachers moving together.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Step 1: Identify Schools. We are currently identifying 6 urban public elementary schools that are located in lower-income communities within Los Angeles County (at the time of submission, 2 school districts are confirmed). We are selecting lower-income schools because historically, these schools have cut PE teachers from their budgets and have left PE Instruction to classroom teachers. The problem is that those classroom teachers have very little, to no training or experience in PE instruction or in outdoor classroom management skills. In the South Bay region of LA County, we have found that teachers in these communities are eager and willing to learn new techniques and skills to improve how they deliver PE.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Obesity rates",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The ultimate goal of COPA is to decrease the prevalence of childhood obesity. This is especially important in many urban, low-income communities within Los Angeles County where the childhood obesity rates exceed that of the County, State, or Country.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have already identified two school districts that each contains at least one school that is ready to implement COPA. We continue to dialogue with interested schools (and are open to new schools who find out about our program through this competition!) and will have them lined up and ready to start if we are fortunate enough to win this competition.",

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "The long range goal is to make Los Angeles easier to get around. This includes commuting to work as well as traveling to all the destinations that make living in the city a rewarding experience. We all know how overstressed the freeway system has become. We know how frustrating it is to be driving down the freeway, only to see a wall of tail lights go on just ahead of us.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "It is obvious that developing a citywide and countywide system of mass transportation will benefit practically everyone who lives in the Los Angeles area. We all need to move around in the city, but we are currently caught in an overstressed system that does not provide enough freeway lanes or city streets to serve our needs. Even freeway commuters will be helped as many of us leave the freeways and use alternative transportation.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Since the basic purpose of the project is to make it possible for people to want to use mass transportation rather than their own cars, the metric \"number of public transit riders\" is clear and obvious. Since one of the purposes of creating mass transit is to reduce freeway congestion and to provide transportation that is faster and less interrupted than driving the freeway during rush hours, the metric \"median travel time to work\" should also be included. Los Angeles residents have become used to long commute times. A light rail or personal rapid transit journey into downtown Los Angeles or to another business center should proceed at a high rate of speed and with few of the interruptions characteristic of freeway driving. Thus we expect that the median travel time to work will be improved by the completion of the various rapid transit systems, and the system as a whole, including getting to and from home, will be improved by our project.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "At some time in the future, we expect to see an increased number of L.A. residents using rapid transit to get to work and play, and we expect to see that their trips are made easier by comprehensive networks of local transportation that will move them between their homes and the rapid transit stations. This is of course a long range goal, and not something that we will be able to demonstrate within the one year scope of the proposed project.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The two important lessons we have learned involve the public mood regarding the current transportation mess, and how the public decison making process works in the real world.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Since our plan is to devise the basic concepts for a citywide network that will get people to and from mass transit, but not actually to build that network, the project can be completed in a year. This does not mean that we will stop working after a year, but that we intend to complete the critical first stage in the prescribed time.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "This project will devise a practical solution for getting people from their homes to the nearest rapid transit station and back again. To do this, we need to work with L.A. residents who will use the new systems, as well as with manufacturers and transit agencies.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Interestingly, our collaborators include not only our nonprofit organization members including the Transit Coalition, they also include neighborhood councils created by the City of Los Angeles, mass transit providers, companies that are currently developing personal rapid transit, and academic experts in the field of transportation.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The core project of getting people interested in the process and getting them to participate is not a huge challenge. We have a lot of experience in making use of already existing public organizations for the purpose of holding public discussion and debate. There is always a challenge in getting time on any organization's agenda, but transportation issues are a very high priority everywhere in the region, so we don't anticipate too much of a problem in this regard.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "In order to get people out of their cars, we need to create effective ways to get them to rapid transit stations.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "A lot of L.A. residents would use mass transportation if there were a way to get between home and the station. Our project is to develop a plan for moving people from where they live to the closest rapid transit. It is a critical element in developing L.A. connectedness.",

M+B will provide these Los Angeles classrooms with a comprehensive instructional outline of our service learning project. Each aspect of our project is designed to make it easy for the teachers and fun for the students. Before the teachers present this service learning project to their classrooms, M+B will lead an assembly at the schools explaining the program in detail. We will supply each teacher with all of the products and tools needed to implement the project and help distribute the books collected from the students to local in-need recipients. M+B will provide a small reserve of books in each classroom for children who are unable to donate a book on their own. It is just as important to experience giving so we want to make sure that all children have this opportunity.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "M+B will take our successful proven model of \"book-raising\" and implement it into Los Angeles classrooms and partnering community-based children's organizations. Third or fourth grade Los Angeles classrooms will \"book-raise\" for their service learning project. M+B will research a specific group of children in their area (homeless shelters, foster kid programs, after school programs, battered women and children shelters) that will receive the books. Students will inscribe their books, creating a personal connection to this giving experience. We will then deliver the books to their local peers. These books will become one of the very first storybooks that the underprivileged children can call their own.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "The sustainability of a literate society largely depends on the accessibility of books (Education Insider).\"Getting books into the homes of children is what's important,\"(Celia Yusem, LAUSD teacher of 40 years). There are books in the school libraries but students who read at home are better, more efficient readers and have higher math scores according to the National Education Association. Having books in the home is important for children to master literacy skills. Additionally, according to the National Service Learning Clearinghouse, exposing children to service learning increases acceptance of diversity, development of ethics, development of caring, and other social emotional learning. Bringing the Milk+Bookies service learning project to Los Angeles schools will give all students important skills in life that will foster Los Angeles children to feel empowered, equip them with the basic skills needed for academic challenges and encourage them to be socially-minded citizens.",

The second major barrier is related to the metaphorical infrastructure. Since our aim is to be an intermediary, we will have maximum impact only if we can have collective impact with the junior colleges, four year institutions and startup accelerators. We are confident we can establish these relationships over time since we are offering something that is \"value added\" for each of the sectors we are trying to engage.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "We’ve heard it all before; the US economy will never be as robust as the last generation’s, global competition has lead to the outsourcing of even our white collar jobs, the internet has eaten away at every major business model and the U.S is lagging in educational rankings but scores highest in student debt.

CASA/LA is the quintessential “volunteer centered organization” in that all direct services are provided by volunteers who have one thing in common: their commitment to speaking for a child who has no voice. CASA’s ensure that the child receives the services and support he needs: from the basics – clothes, school supplies – to most importantly, the attention and care that he needs to thrive.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We are looking to host an aggressive six-month recruitment campaign where we will be better able to target specific populations through our strategic collaborations and through flyers, events, advertising, social media, and word-of-mouth marketing.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Our first barrier will be in connecting with partner organizations. Our staff is small and other organizations their own other priorities as well, but we hope that through the LA2050 project, we will be able to focus our efforts on effective outreach and networking to create strong and productive collaborations.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Our CASAs do demanding, challenging, and time-consuming work. Without support and appreciation, it is far too easy to burn out. The media periodically chronicles how the dependency system is “broken” and the challenges that the children face. Our volunteers must and do face these challenges head-on, no matter how much institutional resistance they receive, no matter how horrifying the child’s circumstances. We have realized that in order to prevent this “burn out,” we must not only increase the number and diversity of our CASAs, but we must provide exceptional training, coaching, and support to these volunteers."

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Balkans-LA project proposed for the LA2050 Grants Challenge will create a new cultural experience for Angelenos by presenting a year-long program of culturally-specific cinematic works and live performances highlighting THE BALKAN CULTURES (the Project). No less than 10 multi-disciplinary programs will be produced, including original production of performances by California-based artists, providing audiences with a vibrant snapshot of the art, music, film, popular theater and dances from South East Europe (SEE). The program will also serve as the training ground for our partner's career technical education students to apply their skills and get access to creative industries, jobs and marketplace.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "The Balkan cultures have given us geniuses like Serbian-American scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla, notorious events like the assassination in Sarajevo in 1914 which precipitated WWI, Hollywood mythology based on the character of Count Dracula, and world figures like Mother Theresa. There is hardly a better place than Los Angeles for the very diverse content from a European frontier to fit culturally and engage its peers.",

We will research, conduct interviews, hold focus groups and brainstorm with the community. We will include what has been successful from our own work and can be expanded. We will champion best practices from other innovators, solicit diverse interests and input, and look for opportunities to connect with other groups that are aligned with our vision. We will pay close attention to the unique opportunities in Los Angeles and look for the most agile and effective tools. Finally we will work with a creative team to produce an accessible and transformative document that offers a community-based strategy for helping LA evolve into a sharing city model. We will then work with Shareable to promote the blueprint internationally as an open source guide.",

One challenge we face is the ability to attend community gatherings, visit schools and stage along the River while realizing the very real needs to plan, prepare and maintain the vehicle. We know there will be a learning curve as we become acquainted with the vehicle. We know that we want to maximize our reach and respond to the public demand to learn about the River's past, present and future plans while also meeting the need to connect with the River for recreation and respite. Initially we'll give priority to events within the River's 800 square mile-watershed, visit schools in disadvantaged and park-poor communities, promote Riverside events and programming to maximize our reach and connect with as many people as we can without over-committing our resources.",

This is extra amazing because some of us weren’t totally enthusiastic about locating our office in such a questionable neighborhood. But then a funny thing happened - we walked the streets and discovered and explored. And soon it wasn’t so questionable and we didn’t feel as unsafe. Other artists and creatives also discovered the neighborhood and also went out and explored and that also made everyone feel safer and more connected. Now more people live there. There are parks and cafes and monthly celebrations of art and culture – and we still can’t convince terrified suburbanites to come and visit us. We think they need a reason to walk the streets and see and learn.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "As we mentioned before, we think the game has the potential to move the metrics by motivating discovery. Our experience in our neighborhood has been that the more people come out and start using a space, the better and safer the space and its surrounding area becomes. We think the game is a great way to make people aware of spaces and opportunities they may not have encountered – ironically by using a smartphone that so often distracts from these sorts of beauties. We look forward to those moments when players lift their eyes from the screen and see amazing things in their own physical world.",

The model provides a creative entrepreneurial platform for women to develop healthy paleta and agua fresca recipes by drawing from their culinary repertoires brought from their hometowns in Latin America and incorporate knowledge of the best health food trends in Los Angeles.

His first hand account of how the music business bubble burst, along with Andres Ospina and Danilo Arroyo’s experience as musicians in their early 20’s when the digital revolution kicked in, informs the core philosophy for L Creativo in their way of doing business. L Creativo seeks a more sustainable approach. Fueling an industry of excess and recklessness is not something that interests L Creativo. L Creativo’s approach is investing in creativity as the foundation for an entire community to find a subsistence mode. We were very inspired by Adam Braun’s Pencils of Promise point of view. He said, in a nutshell, that the new model is that for-profit companies start moving towards a more purpose-driven way of doing business, and non-profit start looking at their cause with business strategies. He coined the term ‘profitable purpose’. Taking this as a guiding philosophy, L Creativo set out to establish a Music Catalog, that aims at giving artists a strong foothold by ways of favorable terms, namely no required exclusivity, zero intrusion into the copyrights of the material, and an above average percentage for the artist for every publishing deal. Greed was depriving artists, L Creativo learned from this lesson and is now proposing an alternative.",

Interfaith provides clients with four bags of food: a “wet” bag (containing refrigerated/frozen items such as dairy and meat), a “dry” bag (containing canned goods, cereals, and other packaged, non-refrigerated items), fresh produce when available, and a bag of bread/tortillas. The food plans will take into consideration the items being distributed and offer recipes, preparation tips, and other information which would allow clients to use the food to the most of its nutritious and economic potential. Each quarter (season) would have its own detailed plan, and this would reflect the what is offered by Interfaith and also what is available at that time of the year. Information in both the informative pamphlet and seasonal plan pamphlet would be compiled by health/nutrition students in the area and PIH Health, under the direction of the program administrator. Clients would pick up these materials as they signed in before they received their food. (3) Food Preparation Demonstrations: The third part of the Four Seasons of Food program will be the offering of food demonstrations/cooking classes for clients. Every quarter clients will be invited to sign up for a demonstration in the on-site kitchen/preparation room or the facilities at Whittier Area First Day, which will inform clients of healthy/economical ways to prepare the food provided weekly. (4) Kitchen Items:The final phase of Four Seasons of Food will be the purchase and distribution of kitchen items at demonstration classes to complement each season and provide clients with a tangible tool to prepare/keep food. The items for each season will be as follows: spring will be a juicer, summer will be a smoothie maker, fall will be items to pack a healthy lunch (portion controlled, cooled lunchboxes), and winter will be a slow cooker/crock pot.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "One in six American families are currently experiencing food insecurity, which is defined as not the total absence of food, but rather the constant fear that the next meal can not be counted on (National Geographic 2014). The majority of food insecure households have at least one working parent employed in a full time job, but due to low wages and high living expenses, the “new face of poverty” seen nationwide is one that is not only struggling to get by, but also lacking the time and energy necessary to prepare labor intensive meals with nutritiousness in mind. Melissa Boteach, vice president of the Poverty and Prosperity Program of the Center for American Progress notes in the August 2014 issue of National Geographic, that “the paradox that hunger and obesity are two sides of the same coin.” Many “make trade-offs between food that is filling but not nutritious and may actually contribute to obesity.” Continuing, the undeniable link between being overweight and having food insecurity is explained because “junk food [is] plentiful and often cheap, hunger and obesity are now parallel problems.”",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Interfaith Food Center currently partners with PIH Health, Whittier Area First Day, Whittier College, and Biola University, as well as having the support and resources of many talented volunteers. Specifically, PIH Health has nutritionists and chefs to assist in compiling informational pamphlets and menus. Whittier Area First Day is a local homeless shelter. The shelter just received a new commercial grade kitchen, which they will make available to Interfaith Food Center to conduct classes, if necessary. Both Whittier and Biola Colleges partner with Interfaith Food Center for internships and research classes, making them the perfect partners for program evaluation and implementation. The three factors that are critical to the success of the proposed collaboration are (1) access to nutritional information and menu planning; (2) ability to conduct classes and; (3) expertise and knowledge to evaluate and measure success. The proposed partners meet these critical factors.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Access to healthy food",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "City and unincorporated area of Whittier and the cities of La Mirada and Santa Fe Springs.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "In order to check the progress of Four Seasons of Food, two processes will be used. (1) Surveys: At the end of each quarter a short, anonymous survey will be available for the clients to pick up at the front desk to be filled out at home and then dropped in a box when they return the next week. The survey will be at the front desk for all clients who regularly pick up to be able to receive and return. (2)Focus Group/Individual Testimonials: In accordance with Interfaith policy, every card must re-register within the first two months of the year in order to renew their membership and maintain an active status to continue to pick up food. After a full year of Four Seasons of Food, all returning clients will be surveyed about their experiences. On the registration forms there will be a special section of questions dealing with Four Seasons of Food, such as rating clients’ perception on the program, if their diet changed, and also if they noticed a change in their health. All returning clients who re-register will be asked about their experience with Four Seasons of Food.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Two recent news articles reflect what Interfaith has seen for years, the illustration of the relationship between poverty and obesity: a National Geographic article on the \"New Face of Hunger,\" and a recent Frontline story on \"Hungry Children.\"",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The two major challenges anticipated will be (1) adjusting the food items being distributed to meet the health standards outlined in the Four Seasons of Food plans and (2) the distribution of kitchen items.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The first action would be to hire a part time program administrator to oversee the project and begin collaborations with different resources in the community."

    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Working families in Los Angeles face the challenges of managing insufficient money, finding affordable housing, raising healthy families, and preparing for the future. Nearly half of LA’s households do not earn enough to meet basic expenses. The region lacks adequate well-paying jobs in growth sectors. For many households, entrepreneurship is a primary route to financial stability. Small business ownership creates opportunities for low-income families to pursue stability and economic mobility, while creating jobs in their communities. Research has shown that if one in three microenterprises hired an additional person, the U.S. would return to full employment; if every microbusiness generated $5,000 more annually, this would add $20B to the economy. Mobile food trucks provide a unique opportunity for all types of individuals to create gainful and lasting employment for themselves, their family members, and their communities. Yet only 50% of small businesses survive, often due to an inability to access the capital they need to grow because of language and cultural barriers, limited assets, low capital needs, and poor/insufficient credit.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Each Opportunity Fund loan creates and sustains an average of 2.7 jobs. Our goal of providing 600 loans in Los Angeles in the next year means that we will help create and sustain more than 1,600 jobs in the region, and our 80 loans to food truck entrepreneurs will drive demand for food trucks, helping to create and sustain employment for local manufacturers. Opportunity Fund’s small business owners in Los Angeles are 98% minority, and 40% are women.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "As California’s largest nonprofit microlender, Opportunity Fund provides loans of $2,500 to $100,000 at affordable, fixed interest rates to small business owners with small capital needs and imperfect credit so they can build an enterprise, support their families, and create jobs. The mobile food industry offers low-income entrepreneurs—especially minorities and women—a way to support their families and build financial independence. Yet many of these small business owners cannot qualify for a bank loan to purchase food carts or trucks, or to pay for upgrades and replacement equipment. Opportunity Fund seeks to fill this gap by offering food truck vendors access to affordable, appropriate capital through our Food Truck Financing initiative.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "LA’s food truck culture supports thousands of jobs through a symbiotic relationship between manufacturers, vendors, and residents who love street food. By providing financing to help food truck entrepreneurs start and grow mobile food businesses in LA, Opportunity Fund serves as an engine to drive growth in the industry. We have established strong collaborations with Los Angeles’ largest mobile food truck manufacturers—including Kareem Carts, West Coast Catering Trucks, and Polo’s Mobile Catering Trucks—who refer aspiring and current food truck owners to Opportunity Fund when they need financing for new or upgraded equipment. Together with these partners, we provide the equipment and financing necessary for these small business owners to grow their enterprises and realize their dreams.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Small businesses are the engine of the U.S. economy, making up 64% of new private sector jobs. Despite being critical to the country’s economic health, 8,000 small businesses are denied loans every day. As mentioned above, only 50% of small businesses survive, often due to the inability to access the financing they need to grow their business.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Opportunity Fund is a not-for-profit financial institution that advances the economic well-being of working families in California by helping them earn, save, and invest in the future. We are recognized as a thought leader in microfinance, with a track record of community impact and a reputation for innovation. We made our first microloan in Los Angeles in 2010. Since then, the number of loans we have originated in the County has grown from 45 per year to more than 400 per year. In that time, Opportunity Fund has also become California’s largest microlender and one of the fastest growing in the U.S. (we invested more than $27M in 1,425 small businesses over the past year). We have made aggressive investments in the talent and technology it takes to fill the financing gap faced by underserved entrepreneurs in the LA region and are well-positioned to meet our goal to provide loans to 600 small business owners in Los Angeles, including 80 loans to food truck entrepreneurs, this year.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Opportunity Fund seeks to scale our microlending program in LA’s underserved communities to support more than 600 small business owners, including 80 food truck entrepreneurs, each year. In the coming year, we will:",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Opportunity Fund uses a variety of performance indicators to measure the success of our microloans and our small business clients. In the short term, we track the number of applicants and number, dollar volume, and type of loans originated, as well as client characteristics such as income, ethnicity, gender, credit score, household size, type of business, sales, and number of employees.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Obstacles such as language barriers and insufficient credit mean that many low-income small business owners operate outside of the financial mainstream, making them hard for Opportunity Fund to reach even as we offer the financial products they need to grow. We have built a multi-lingual team with strong connections to local communities to help us reach and serve this target population. In addition, we have focused on building referral partnerships with banks and business services providers, like Kareem Carts, who can help us identify entrepreneurs who lack nothing but the financing they need to succeed.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Opportunity Fund's Food Truck Financing initiative will provide microloans to mobile food vendors throughout LA County, supporting economic and social vitality by creating jobs and bringing healthy food options to underserved communities across the region. Our goal is to provide $2M in microloans to local food truck entrepreneurs to upgrade or purchase food trucks (as part of our overall goal to invest $9M in 600 underserved small business owners in the region). By enabling low-income food truck entrepreneurs to access the capital and support they need to grow and create jobs, our microlending program drives economic mobility for these small business owners, while also generating demand to support local food truck manufacturers."

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Health care access: SCC is committed to serving anyone in need of health care regardless of their insurance or income status. SCC offers services at three sites, namely the Beverly Health Center, S. Mark Taper Foundation Health Center, and Wallis Annenberg Children and Family Health Center at Hollywood Wilshire Health Center. Multiple entry points across Los Angeles allows patients to access health care easier and more conveniently.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "SCC learned the significant need for the NEP through its 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). SCC has utilized this report to learn about the growing health concerns of its communities in its service area as well as in Los Angeles County, as a whole. The CHNA indicated that 14% of SCC’s adult population is diagnosed with diabetes and 26% with hypertension. Further, 8% of SCC’s adult population is obese (BMI is greater than 30). SCC aims to address these issues through preventative health care services and education, both of which the NEP provides.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Nutrition Education Program (NEP) currently provides primary and preventive nutrition education with a focus on targeting patients at risk for or suffering from chronic disease. Funds from LA 2050 will expand NEP’s one-on-one and group education sessions to more patients and underwrite the addition of free Pre-Diabetic classes and Fitness classes. The NEP is open to all individuals at Saban Community Clinic (SCC). The NEP’s goal is to ensure the health and wellbeing of individuals by increasing access to nutrition services and promoting an active and healthier lifestyle.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The NEP has been part of SCC’s primary services since September 2013. Implementation of its services is ongoing throughout the year. The NEP is led by Maria Paz Quiroga, M.S., R.D., Nutritionist, and available at all three of SCC’s sites, name the Beverly Health Center, S. Mark Taper Foundation Health Center, and Wallis Annenberg Children and Family Health Center at Hollywood Wilshire Health Center (WAC). The Pre-Diabetic and Fitness classes will be a new component to the NEP. Ms. Quiroga has already begun developing the curriculum for the Pre-Diabetic and Fitness classes. One-on-one and group education session will be held at all sites and classes will be held at WAC. Education session will be provided during regular business hours and each class will be offered on a bi-monthly basis every Saturday in one hour sessions. Each class will have between 20-30 students and will be provided throughout the year.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "The NEP will make LA the healthiest place to live by providing access to quality and affordable health care, health education, and fitness classes to those most in need. According to the County of Los Angeles’s Key Indicators of Health by Service Planning Area report (2013), 19% of adults in SPA 4 live in neighborhoods that do not have walking paths, parks, playgrounds, or sports fields, thus limiting spaces to exercise. Further, 25% of adults reported their health to be fair or poor, and only 17% of adults say they consume five or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day. These statistics are amongst the highest of the eight LA County SPAs and shows the potential impact the NEP’s services can make.",

    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Yes. The Nutritionist is currently researching and contacting local food banks and researching local grocery stores to provide a list of healthy and affordable food. Local food banks in SCC’s service area include the Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, World Harvest Food Bank, Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, Project Angel Food, and more.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "SCC is in the process of implementing Electronic Health Records (EHR). EHR implementation will significantly improve delivery of services in addition to quality improvement efforts. However, SCC anticipates a loss in productivity during the initial onset of EHR as staff is trained and familiarized with the system. This anticipated loss in productivity may limit the number of patients the NEP can serve. In order to accommodate patient access during this period, SCC has extended its hours of operation with evening and weekend medical and dental sessions.",

Our campaign timing is aligned with our local utility’s planning process. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) will be updating their long-term strategic plan in 2015, which will include new investments and overhauling 70 percent of the city’s energy supply over the next 15 years. The question is: will Los Angeles switch from dirty coal to risky natural gas, or will it use this opportunity to break free from fossil fuels once and for all? A comprehensive energy plan from the city should set aggressive but achievable climate targets, anchored in local clean energy programs that provide local economic benefits to the region. Los Angeles has the largest publicly-owned utility in the nation, meaning that every Angeleno is a “shareholder” and has a voice in the direction of the utility. Angelenos love rooftop solar, and we must empower individuals across the city to ensure that their voices are heard so that the utility commits to a clean energy future.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "LA has a staggering amount of flat, empty roof space, bathed in sunlight for roughly 260 days a year. However, less than 2% of LA’s electricity currently comes from solar power. Increasing the role of rooftop solar lessens our dependence on fossil fuels, enhances economic development opportunities, and creates jobs. Our project will aim to democratize energy decisions by engaging the public with the goal of getting 20 percent of LA’s energy from rooftop solar by 2020. Over the next year, this project will organize communities across the city and build broad-based support for a city that harvests the sun to power our neighborhoods. We envision a future where LA runs on 100% clean energy and every building can be powered with rooftop solar.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Los Angeles will benefit greatly from a robust market for rooftop solar on homes, office buildings, schools, warehouses, parking lots, and other facilities. Solar can benefit our environment, our health and our economy by providing cleaner air, reducing global warming, conserving water, and creating jobs. Our project generates a broad array of benefits for residents of LA and surrounding areas, with an emphasis on equity. In completing this project, there are a set of benefits that Angelenos will share broadly, as well as specific benefits to subsets of the city and county’s population.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will measure success through the following measurable deliverables:",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. Big changes rarely happen without strong public demand. In order for the city to really invest in an expedited clean energy future, the millions of Angelenos that support clean energy must be given the opportunity to make their voices heard. We already know that Angelenos want more solar. In a 2012 poll, more than 85 percent of responding LADWP customers agreed that more of the utility’s energy should come from solar power. And nearly three-quarters of respondents wanted at least half of the city’s electricity supply to come from renewable energy. Yet most LADWP customers do not get the chance to talk to LADWP leaders or city decision-makers about these issues. Through this project, our coalition will act as a conduit for public engagement. We will elevate the existing public demand for clean energy and increased rooftop solar and ensure that elected officials and key staff are hearing from Angelenos about what they want, and are using this information to inform administrative energy decisions.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1. Ensuring equity in the solar program: As described above, low income communities and communities of color would benefit from increased solar more than almost any other group. Unfortunately, the upfront costs associated with solar can be prohibitive for low-income populations. Additionally, many low-income populations live in multifamily buildings and do not own the property, leaving the decision to install solar to the building owner and out of the hands of the residents.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "We are dedicated to exploring, enjoying and protecting the planet.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Los Angeles has the dirtiest air in the country and reliance on fossil fuels, including for our power plants, creates smog and soot that leads to premature deaths and asthma attacks. In particular, the residents of mostly low-income communities and communities of color, where the worst polluters are located, experience disproportionate rates of youth and adult asthma hospitalizations, cancer, and premature deaths due to multiple stressors, including environmental factors. Health impacts from stationary pollution sources, such as oil refineries and power plants, are exacerbated by a lack of access to healthcare, limited access to healthy food, and other cumulative impacts.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "This project will be managed collaboratively by the Los Angeles Clean Energy Coalition (the coalition). Specifically, participants in the coalition include Communities for a Better Environment, Environment California Research and Policy Center, Global Green USA, Los Angeles Business Council, Natural Resource Defense Council, Pacoima Beautiful, and the Sierra Club. The coalition has worked together for nearly three years, building support for clean energy across Los Angeles. Our coalition represents various interests in Los Angeles that may not share all of the same goals but are united around a future in which Los Angeles relies on energy efficiency and renewable energy instead of coal and natural gas, producing an environmentally friendly economy that does not leave any of our communities behind.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Our coalition brings together a unique set of skills, including communication experts, business leaders, and community organizers. Our campaign focuses on one outcome with four primary components. When we win, 20% of Angelenos’ power will come from rooftop solar by 2020, and we will be on track to achieve our vision of 100% clean energy in LA by 2050. To get there, we propose four campaign components: (1) grassroots community education/empowerment to democratize solar; (2) demonstration solar projects; (3) media campaign; and (4) summer solstice solar event.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "SEE THE LIGHT is uniquely designed to take advantage of the rich resources we have in the LA metropolitan area – namely the bar-setting arts and entertainment industry and the thriving local non-profit community- and make them more available to the youth engaged in our programs. Many of these youth, especially those in the less affluent areas, would never otherwise have exposure to such resources. By creating collaborative partnerships between local non-profits (Heal the Bay, Tree People, etc.), the creative arts and entertainment industry, local governing bodies, and local schools we create a learning web for students that inspire them at a passion level so the learning flows naturally. We show them the benefits of cross-pollinating from the many sectors of society to come up with creative solutions to long-held societal problems. We create an “innovation-incubator” for our youth to nurture and build confidence in the budding leader inside. Through mentorship programs and youth summits in our programs and online community, we connect youth directly with places of potential future employment.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By exposing youth to fun, engaging, and relatable STEAM activities, it is anticipated that youth will be more likely to further explore STEAM topics. Youth served will understand the relevance of STEAM careers in the 21st century and will also be exposed to the fact that -- since the recession -- STEAM careers have actually emerged as fast growing and high paying. By providing youth with hands-on STEAM experience, we will foster an early interest in topics that youth are not traditionally exposed to until they reach high school and college. Our awareness campaign will create an avenue for Youth Leaders to truly participate in creating and innovating, which will make the information and activities they present more compelling and relevant.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Success will be demonstrated through the following:",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "By combining the 77 years of experience BGCH has and the creative and innovative STEAM curriculum that 9 Dots has created and implemented over the past 3 years, the IamLA Campaign will successfully take its message to 15 schools. Both organizations have a wide range of potential youth leaders for the campaign. The existing partnerships and contracts with LAUSD schools will make it easier for us to establish connections and partnerships with the 15 schools where we plan to conduct outreach.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "The IamLA STEAM Campaign will help the Youth Leaders strengthen their leadership skills, public speaking skills, and teamwork skills, while simultaneously empowering them to create positive changes in their community. Educational researchers have found that peer teaching and peer-to-peer collaboration are highly effective. Therefore, due to the youth-led aspect of the IamLA Campaign, the students that the Youth Leaders present to will be excited by STEAM subjects, how these subjects relate to everyday life, and what STEAM could mean to them in their future careers. Furthermore, students served by the IamLA campaign will be inspired and motivated to learn STEAM subjects and engage in discussions with parents and school officials about their futures in STEAM. This project will also build in the community by laying the foundation for developing more partnerships among organizations, youth, and individuals to further promote diversity in STEAM fields. In addition, the accessibility of the website and blog will create a space that will continue to raise awareness of STEAM and develop new ideas for partnerships throughout Los Angeles and beyond.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Our youth-led IamLA Campaign will inspire Los Angeles youth to study and pursue STEAM related careers.",

Campaign impacting over 1000 Los Angeles youth. The IamLA Campaign will provide innovative, fun, and engaging hands-on activities at low-performing, Title I elementary and middle schools in East, South, and Central LA during the 2014-2015 school year. To wrap up, a carnival will be held for youth organizations, families, and school officials who are interested in participating during the following school year. The carnival will give youth the opportunity to apply concepts learned and demonstrate the limitless potential of Los Angeles youth.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "For 77 years, BGCH has provided out-of-school educational and enrichment programs for underprivileged students. 9 Dots was founded in 2011 by three engineering alumni from Stanford University with degrees in mechanical engineering, environmental engineering, and computer science and a Ph.D student in UCLA’s Department of Education. 9 Dots provides homework help, math and literacy enrichment, and hands-on STEAM projects after school. BGCH and 9 Dots are both located in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, a high-poverty area where the median income ($33,694) is far lower than the county’s ($56,241) and the state’s ($61,400), and almost a third of adults 25 years or older never finished high school.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The IamLA STEAM Campaign will primarily benefit Los Angeles youth in grades 1-8 in the Los Angeles Unified School District, a demographic that is predominantly low income and African American or Latino. The campaign will also benefit the community at large by creating more young role models and leaders working to better their communities. We believe that the age group we are targeting with our campaign is most likely to develop an interest in STEAM, as they have many more years of school left to continue developing their interest in and knowledge of STEAM before applying to college. In the long run, we hope to see an increase in diversity in STEAM fields.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "9 Dots Learning Center is partnering with the Boys & Girls Club of Hollywood to create the IamLA STEAM Campaign. BGCH and 9 Dots have existing partnerships with schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and have previously worked together to share curriculum and provide STEAM professional development workshops. Additional collaborations with local colleges and student organizations from UCLA, USC and CSUN will provide guidance, onsite visits with professors, and real time learning. BGCH has worked with the Office of Admissions from these local colleges and will continue to do so in order to gain access to professors and the hands-on learning experiences we plan to offer our youth leaders.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The IamLA Campaign was created to help underserved and underrepresented youth develop essential STEAM skills and to address the severe underrepresentation of minority professionals, particularly Latino and African American professionals, in these fields. According to the US Department of Commerce, science, technology, engineering, and math jobs are projected to grow almost twice as fast as those in other classifications over the next few years. Moreover, these jobs pay significantly more – 26% more – than their counterparts. Despite making up one-fourth of the workforce in 2009, only 2% of Latino workers and 3% of African American workers held jobs in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Coordinating the presentations at the schools and obtaining permission for students to leave their classrooms can be very difficult because public schools have a finite number of hours designated for class time. However, our long-standing relationships with our schools will aid in our ability to overcome any obstacles. If we approach the school administrators far enough in advance, we believe we will be able to work it into their schedule."

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Climate Cents provides a way for Angelenos to improve LA’s environment and connect with their neighbors across the city while helping to prevent climate change. When Angelenos go to the CC website, they sign up to support environmental projects of their choosing with a small monthly contribution. These projects, run by partner organizations, include restoring kelp forests, planting trees and urban gardens, and upgrading the energy-efficiency of low-income houses. CC collects data on the amount of carbon-reduction impact of each project per dollar spent. CC then presents supporters with that information in user-friendly form, including a stream of photos, videos, and data visualizations that show the impact of their contribution.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Climate Cents starts from the premise that people would like to take action on critical environmental problems like LA’s poor air quality and the rising tide of global climate change, but feel too overwhelmed and powerless to actually do something. It can be difficult to engage people about a seemingly insurmountable problem, especially when their lives are busy and most strategies don’t engage them personally.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Climate Cents will help people and neighborhoods all over Los Angeles, with specific benefits in low-income and disadvantaged communities that have suffered the worst effects of environmental injustice. LA’s environmental problems are severe. Our area has some of the worst air quality in the nation, which results from a combination of industrial production and automobile exhaust, especially from the port/trucking sector. And the brunt of pollution falls disproportionately on low-income neighborhoods, in predominantly Latino and Black communities. Since these communities are three times more likely to live close to hazardous facilities, their exposure to air toxins is fifty percent greater than other Angelenos.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "It is feasible to implement the Climate Cents project within the next twelve months. Nick Karno, the founder of Climate Cents has extensively thought through the project’s execution. He has received enthusiastic responses among a wide range of potential stakeholders and constituents when he’s raised the idea. Partner organizations are very interested. One is committed for the beta phase and several want to join for the full launch. Part of the reason Climate Cents is well-positioned to launch is that Karno has a long record of community involvement and environmental activism. He brings the relationships, knowledge, and skills necessary for Climate Cents’ partnerships and community outreach.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "The most measurable pay-off from Climate Cents, both now and in 2050, is increased funding for tree planting, urban farms, ocean revitalization, and energy efficiency projects that will make LA a healthier, more pleasant, and more connected place to live. These will contribute to a city in which people don’t face environmental health hazards, where they can breathe clean air, drink clean water, relax and exercise among ample greenery and in the oceans, and eat good local food.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The central challenge of Climate Cents is to engage supporters in such a powerful way that they donate monthly. We have a three-part strategy to succeed.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Climate Cents is in the process of launching. We are in the beta-phase now, creating a website and testing the user-experience of it with a group of beta-users, while also experimenting with organizational partnerships and data-collection. During the beta phase, the test group will be donating to the Kelp Restoration Project at The Bay Foundation. Since nearly 40% of the CO2 in our atmosphere is absorbed by our oceans, kelp forests have been identified as effective carbon sinks that can sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate Cents has already formed a relationship with the Bay Foundation for this purpose. As users follow the project they have funded, we will track how they experience the interactive process.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We have confirmed a partnership with the Bay Foundation to fund their Kelp Restoration Project as part of our beta-test. We are in talks with three more groups, listed below, for the January 2015 launch of Climate Cents. There’s a standard relationship between Climate Cents and its partners. We provide funding for the partners to amplify the impact of their environmental projects and in return, the partners facilitate CC’s calculation of carbon reduction per dollar invested and the visual documentation of the project’s impact.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Access to healthy food",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Climate Cents works by collaborating with environmental groups that are already making a difference on these metrics and using its platform to supercharge their impact through data transparency, public awareness, and crowdsourced funding.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Evaluation and measurement are central to the concept of Climate Cents. We intend for Climate Cents to become the premier public clearinghouse for local, crowd-sourced investment in local carbon reduction projects through careful tracking and transparent broadcasting of data. We will be scientifically measuring the carbon reduction achieved by each project we invest in, calculating the payoff per dollar, and reporting the results, with a high level of granularity, back to the Climate Cents members. For that reason, there are many metrics we will be able to use as we evaluate the success of Climate Cents."

What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Firstly, one of the major challenges is to be able to describe real world problems within the game. Often games follow a certain logic for entertainment value and they do not need to have real world accuracy. Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, explains this very well. He argues that a game needs to be engaging, as without that engagement people will not play it. This forces game designers to compromise on the accuracy of the models in order to make them more fun. Whilst we want to create engagement, we also want to connect the game to the real world by incorporating the actual energy consumption of a certain service, for example. We believe this will be a crucial challenge that the project will need to address.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "BLOCK is a video game for city planning and speculation. The game is founded on ideas of ecology, establishing the interdependencies of city entities such as housing, shops, parks and infrastructure. By allowing the player to understand how to use resources (money, waste, social capital), we can encourage entrepreneurship through the design of an ecological urbanism, allowing for new opportunities to be conceived in the city. The objective of the game is to both educate people and to generate user data for design patterns for the LA of 2050, producing the first database of a future city. The project will be open-source and free to access. The first prototype of the game has already been developed within USC School of Architecture.",

    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "LA is a city that has been built by its inhabitants. Is in in their power to make a significant new change. The LA of 2050 will be shaped by a generation that is currently very young. It requires a ‘massive design medium’ to expand the imagination of the current generation. Video games have the reach to affect a larger community. They also offer the possibility to simulate systems; Systems thinking is one of the fundamental challenges of the 21st century. If we have engaging video games that can simulate the quality of the air, the health of the city and the interdependences of businesses, we can allow individuals and organizations to see how their own ideas are intertwined.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Change takes time, and the beneficiaries of this project will truly be near future generations.

    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We already have established relationships and partnerships with groups from different sectors of Los Angeles County. This particular project is aimed at becoming a more sustainable resource for the city, serving a greater number of people in need as well as increasing our community outreach. The funds from this grant will help us utilize social media more effectively and re-market our organization. We will also be able to provide more workshops to more people, helping to strengthen our relationship with existing partners and network/build relationships with new agencies. Because we are not starting from the ground up and already have a focus for the year, expanding our reach and our organization can easily be done in 12 months.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We have partnerships with many programs and non-profits throughout the county. An example of a few agencies we collaborate with are LA Works, Children's Institute Inc., LA County of Education, The Salvation Army Bell Shelter, Single Room Occupancy Inc., Substance Abuse Foundation, U.S. Veterans Initiative, and Volunteers of America.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By providing business clothing and employment services, we arm low-income jobseekers with the tools necessary to obtain employment. We currently have about a 65% success rate in participants obtaining employment after receiving clothing and/or attending one of our workshops. Our primary goal is to aid in decreasing the rate of unemployment in LA, which currently is higher than the national average. Through obtaining job security, some of our clients who were once homeless are able to subsequently obtain housing and other clients have risen out of the poverty threshold.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "This organization was founded by a student of UCLA Anderson School of Business in 1995 as part of a school project. She distributed needs assessments to different organizations around the city and found that though there were many employment services, they reported that their participants were in need of professional attire and etiquette for job interviews.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1) Securing funds to ensure that our organization remains sustainable through the years.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "We partner with employment and vocational programs in Los Angeles, providing business clothing and job preparation workshops to their clients. We address specific barriers that interfere with employment opportunities to those who are low-income and cannot afford professional attire, those who have spent a long period of time out of the workplace and need instruction on business attire and etiquette, and those who are socially disadvantaged. Clients who may be equally qualified with competing job applicants will lose job opportunities if they cannot present a professional image."

Once a thriving area of creators and manufacturers, much of Boyle Heights now feels like an industrial desert. At our i.am Makerspace, we’ll provide top-notch education and mentorship, bringing high-tech skills to an underserved community. Combined with its rich history of making, Boyle Heights can become a hub for innovation. Not only does uplift a struggling neighborhood, but it creates a better Los Angeles – by cultivating a larger pool of talent coming from diverse backgrounds and walks of life. Rebuilding America starts with rebuilding neighborhoods like Boyle Heights.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "An i.am Makerspace in Boyle Heights will benefit ALL of Los Angeles, not just the east side.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "We’ve proven that we’re invested in Boyle Heights by launching the i.am College Track program, a successful after-school college readiness program which serves 300 high school students from Roosevelt High School.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We already have a space identified in the historic Sears Building in Boyle Heights, and a great team to execute.

    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Outreach to the community is one concern. We want to make sure we serve members of the community that do not normally have access to such maker and entrepreneurial opportunities. As a working class immigrant community, there can be hesitation at first to explore something new, but we plan to community outreach through our students and their parents to build trust within the community.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our most immediate goal is serving the people of Boyle Heights and surrounding neighborhoods. We want to turn Boyle Heights into a model community, with ideas and practices that could be adapted by similar underserved neighborhoods around the country.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The i.am.angel Foundation has existing partnerships with leading tech companies and organizations, who are all ready to expand and take our programs to the next level.

Large numbers of students in LA’s low-income communities are not graduating from high school on time, and even larger numbers are inadequately prepared for college and careers. This, in turn, is contributing to an unprepared workforce and growing income inequality.",

Since beginning our work in LA in 2008, CFY has served over 16,000 families with training and digital learning tools. We have partnered with more than 40 Los Angeles-area middle schools in low-income communities in LAUSD and various charter school networks. We received a $7.6 million federal stimulus grant through the U.S. Department of Commerce that led the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to say that “CFY today is a national model for digital learning” (see http://tinyurl.com/cfy2050 for the full article).",

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. Businesses are looking for skilled laborers with quality soft skills needed to thrive in the workplace. However, measuring soft skills and teaching these skills are difficult to come by because people are difficult to change. In the beginning, new employees are happy workers, but in due time, most complain and are unhappy. About 80% of people in the nation are dissatisfied with their jobs. To combat negative attitude and behavior and lack of productivity, MAPS has implemented a unique career training program for people to develop authentic soft-skills that transfer in the workplace, home, and relationships. In our program, marriages and relationships strengthened, people learned how to get rid of negative emotions and attitudes, and they became motivated. Many developed strong teamwork skills and learned how to help others despite their given tasks. We have testimonials to prove our results; however, people are skeptical with our results. They wonder if we really can redirect people to live better lives. In order to “prove” our results, this time we would like to use research-based pre- and post-assessments to measure people’s change in their productivity, interpersonal skills, attitude, problem-solving, enthusiasm, and more.",

The first step in moving the needle on specific metrics is to create a baseline understanding of current conditions. From there, we can set goals and work together on strategies to achieve those goals. This is what The Wellbeing Project is seeking to accomplish. The mission of LA2050 is closely aligned with the values built in to The Wellbeing Project, and the Connect metrics are already embedded in the analytic framework for the Local Wellbeing Index. We will collect data and provide information specific to these Connect metrics. With a baseline understanding of community needs, we can identify and prioritize collective impact strategies to advance metrics related to civic collaboration, volunteerism, government responsiveness and accountability, and participation in lifelong learning opportunities and meaningful cultural experiences.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "For The Wellbeing Project, success is defined as creating a deep, meaningful understanding of community wellbeing that will guide City staff in making decisions, help local agents of change create social impact programs and partnerships to address community needs, and empower residents to take charge of their own wellbeing and strengthen connections between each other. While we don’t yet know what the Local Wellbeing Index will reveal about the level of wellbeing in our community, we have embarked on an endeavor to move the concept of wellbeing into the mainstream. Increased understanding of the conditions that contribute to wellbeing of people and desire to take action are two aspirational measures of success. The spread of this project to other cities interested in using meaningful data about the wellbeing of people to inform decisions and collective impact is a longer-term goal. Translation of these aspirational goals into measurable outcomes could include the level of engagement with the index, the volume of data received from community members, the number of initiatives or decisions based upon information provided by the index, and the number of cities that have expressed interest in or implemented wellbeing measurement in their communities. It could also include an increase in the number of partnerships formed between service providers and program supporters/donors to deliver services that address specific needs as identified by the Local Wellbeing Index. The ultimate, long-range sign of success would be an uptick in specific areas of wellbeing in need of improvement, as indicated by the Local Wellbeing Index.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementation of The Wellbeing Project is underway. Although this is a big project, we are well-poised to achieve success within 12 months. Specifically, we have:",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "1: Define community wellbeing and the Local Wellbeing Index. Under the advisement of an international, interdisciplinary panel of experts, the City is working with RAND and the New Economics Foundation (nef) to create the analytic framework for the Local Wellbeing Index, a new science-based measurement tool with real-world use. This framework is directly informed by needs expressed by primary end users (City staff). The framework outlines specific things we want to know about our community. Grouped into 5 dimensions (Community, Place, Learning, Health, and Opportunity), these things will tell us who Santa Monica is and how Santa Monica is doing. Through deep listening, we will work with Daylight Design to determine how users might engage with the data, resulting in wireframes for the platform that will bring the index to life online.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Local Wellbeing Index will not be a static report that sits in a drawer. It will be a dynamically-refreshed tool with real-world use. While Local Wellbeing Index will no doubt have broad application, there are three primary end user groups for The Wellbeing Project:",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Wellbeing Project is a game-changing update to the way a community understands its strengths and challenges. The Local Wellbeing Index will harness the power of data to drive action. By reflecting a community back to itself in a genuine, dynamic, data-driven way, city government will have information needed to make better decisions, allow social impact service providers to directly address community needs, and empower residents to take charge of their own wellbeing. This common platform will make it easier to work together to create a city of wellbeing by strengthening community health, cohesion, trust, accountability, and connections. Ultimately, we hope this collective impact strategy will be open and scalable to other cities.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The Wellbeing Project was inspired by Santa Monica’s Cradle to Career initiative (SMC2C), which brought the City, community leaders and concerned residents together to better understand how our children are doing and how we work together to support youth and families. SMC2Cs first major output was the Youth Wellbeing Report Card, a multidimensional measure of how Santa Monica youth were doing. This highly informative case study has taught us about wrangling data to fuel community-based social impact initiatives. During ideation for this project, we paid particular attention to the lessons learned through SMC2C, and the Youth Wellbeing Report Card served as a rough prototype for the Local Wellbeing Index. SMC2C also laid important groundwork for this project by establishing lines of information sharing between major institutions like the City, school district, and Santa Monica College. In addition, the 2014 report card update involved piloting an interactive data visualization platform, helping us learn more about working with data to yield meaningful information upon which action can be based.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Santa Monica",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Santa Monica is a community facing change. Without a common understanding of who the community is and how we connect with one another, fear of change has created artificial barriers between people. Local government is uniquely positioned to make decisions and provide information that could directly facilitate partnerships and improve connections, yet we currently lack the information needed to do so. By creating a way to reflect a community back to itself in a genuine, data-driven way we believe we can begin to move beyond perception and anecdotal information; and that having a better understanding of ourselves in relation to our community will surface similarities and common concerns that will encourage people to work together to improve connections with each other and the world around them. In the short term, The Wellbeing Project is a way to recalibrate the conversation from reactive to proactive, to focus on collective impact and positive change. By 2050, we hope that The Wellbeing Project and the Local Wellbeing Index will have spread to communities beyond Santa Monica, creating a network of like-minded cities bonded by a similar approach to identifying and addressing community needs. Having information needed to promote positive communication, and a platform that engages and connects city staff, service providers, and residents, will strengthen our community, our collective resilience, and our ability to manage change together.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "City Project Team: This interdepartmental group brings diverse interests and expertise to guide the successful implementation and uptake of the project. Participants come from the City Managers Office, Community & Cultural Services, Information Systems, Santa Monica Public Library, Office of Sustainability & the Environment, and Planning & Community Development. In addition, staff from all Departments have been actively engaged in the project, ensuring that the end result will be representative of the broad range of work done by our full service city. This collaborative approach is helping us connect the dots between our work through the lends of wellbeing, setting us up for effective use of the index once it's ready.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The Wellbeing Project is seeking to do something that’s never been done before: create a tool using administrative and subjective data to measure community wellbeing; and then use the information to inform city decision-making processes, facilitate partnerships, and empower residents to create change. To-date unforeseen challenges have arisen and we’ve worked around them - that’s the nature of innovating. Advancing innovation within local government has been and will continue to be a challenge. Resources are strained, our current work never stops, and people are used to doing things in a particular way. By engaging with city staff about the project early and often, and establishing an interdepartmental team of project supporters, we have laid significant groundwork to aid us in continuing to move forward. Bringing Daylight Design on board for the user experience visioning process was particularly helpful in this respect. Their human centered design approach and deep listening skills not only cultivated additional project support within the city organization, it also resulted in making the aspirational vision more concrete and tangible. As we move towards building out the wireframes for the online platform, we will have continual opportunities to re-engage with staff to present this clear vision and show progress over time. Public perception, participation, and engagement will be another challenge. Simply communicating about what wellbeing is, what the project is, and its utility has been a challenge. People confuse ‘wellbeing’ with ‘wellness.’ We’ve also uncovered a key tension between individual wellbeing, community wellbeing, and the City’s role or investment in the wellbeing of people. To address these communications challenges, we’ve established guiding principles, which include clearly stating that improving community wellbeing is a do-it-together effort. The City is not the purveyor of wellbeing, but we can present data, facilitate partnerships, convene forums, and engage community members to advance this initiative. Again, the user experience visioning work completed by Daylight Design will help us address this challenge going forward as we build out a highly engaging and intuitive platform that will bring the index to life online. To accompany this, over the next year we will need to identify and implement communications and engagement strategies as we roll out the index.",

Healthcare professionals are starting to recognize the need for a holistic approach to preventative care and a healthy diet and exercise are key components of this. From the existing LA Community Garden Council gardens, we have evidence that gardeners lose weight in their first year of gardening, which helps to prevent Type 2 Diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, and heart disease. Gardening is relaxing and therapeutic and helps patients with mental illness. By getting children outdoors to garden instead of indoors in front of computer screens, we will help to create positive childhood experiences. We will encourage gardeners to walk, bike or take public transport to their community garden for their health as well as the community’s health.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Access to healthy food",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The most immediate impact of the new community gardens will be to increase access to healthy food. This indirectly offers access to healthcare because a healthy diet is essential as a primary preventative measure in any health plan. The gardens will help to reduce obesity and related diseases. We encourage gardeners to walk, bike or take public transport to the gardens, for their health as well as for environmental reasons. Gardening is therapeutic and helps to reduce mental illness and it gets children outside and in community with people of all generations, increasing the prospect of positive childhood experiences.",

We will partner with LA Conservation Corps to send out teams of paid youth ages 18 to 24 to canvass the neighborhood for approximately eight city blocks around the three identified community garden sites. They will knock on doors, meet the residents, distribute bilingual fliers providing information about the new community garden, and invite them to give us their contact information and attend community meetings. We will also reach out to schools, recreation centers, religious institutions, businesses, and other local organizations to let them know about the community garden and invite them to participate in the planning process.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "To acquire the land, we will partner with organizations including the LA Neighborhood Land Trust and the Trust for Public Land.

This innovative concept can serve as a model across the city, and even the nation. Armed with a community-generated vision and the resources of a national platform, the 2-year EcoDistricts Target Cities program, we are building the foundation of the neighborhood of the future, just as construction of Metro’s Regional Connector begins. We are exploring green infrastructure pilot demonstrations, becoming more water and energy efficient, and launching inspiring and engaging cultural programs that highlight society’s connection to nature.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Like Little Tokyo itself, Sustainable Little Tokyo is both specific and broad, with overlapping layers. While there are direct benefits for those that live and work here, Sustainable Little Tokyo also serves the broader community and Los Angeles.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Percent of imported water",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Sustainable Little Tokyo’s shift from visioning to implementation has a clear pathway for the next 12 months.

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Sustainable Little Tokyo is not just about creating a cultural ecodistrict in Little Tokyo, but also developing a framework for sustainability that can be replicated by other communities, neighborhoods, and cities. Through our groundbreaking approach that combines green infrastructure and initiatives with community organizing, arts and cultural productions, just and equitable economic development, we offer a model for other neighborhoods seeking long term economic, social, and environmental sustainability.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The ecodistrict framework is a new model for resiliency through building and enhancing community governance, local economic development, and reducing dependence on imported energy and water. Little Tokyo is a perfect laboratory for creating this model, because of its 130-year history as a cultural and ethnic neighborhood. We believe that resiliency is, at its core, based on strong social connectedness, high functioning community governance, and inclusion of diverse stakeholders. The neighborhood’s social networks, small business community, culture and arts have thrived despite periods of relocation, displacement, encroachment, and intense economic downturns. We will demonstrate how the ecodistrict concept can be replicated in neighborhoods around LA, creating neighborhoods resilient to the forces and patterns of climate change and economic cycles.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Sustainable Little Tokyo has emerged out of two critical lessons learned by the Little Tokyo community. First, that big innovation happens with public sector collaboration. Second, that community governance defines resilient, sustainable neighborhoods in the long run. The cultural ecodistrict framework is built on these lessons, so that we can advance innovative district infrastructure and new collaborative strategies that can go the distance in reaching the Los Angeles of 2050.",

The specific metrics for success in this initiative will be increases in civic engagement, commitment of public and organizational partners, and establishment of a demonstration/catalyst project.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Although the Little Tokyo community today is highly organized and the LTCC is able to speak with a unified voice on behalf of the community, we must still consider that our primary community – that of the broader Japanese American community – does not in fact live in Little Tokyo. Little Tokyo is the historic home of the Southern California Japanese American community - yet the community is dispersed across the greater Southern California region, making it difficult to engage and connect to the community. The challenge then is how do the LTCC and our partners educate and engage the broader community?"

They had to look at all aspects which made up each client and thus help him or her with individual needs – a holistic approach. This manifested into a broad array of services provided and the opportunity to access these services through many client entry points.

Ninety-nine percent of our collective work is done by volunteers and our operating expense remains below 5% (in fiscal year 2013). The other challenge is program funding, but we make it happen. MEND solicits no government grants and is funded through the generosity of foundations, businesses and individual donors. It also maintains a low overhead of approximately 30 full and part time employees in 2013. On-going collaborations are MEND, to better meet the growing number client applications, has strategically worked to expand its volunteer workforce to more than 5,300 individuals.

Others are single parents with small children who cannot afford childcare to enable then to work outside the home and, thus, must rely on welfare. Still others are individuals who suddenly find themselves unemployed and without financial resources. While some clients live in government subsidized housing, a large percentage share the rental of a house with other families and many still live in garages, shacks, trailers or other forms of substandard housing.

California ranks 18 out of the 20 most highly populated states in high school-to-college enrollment rates. With an 1,000:1 student-to-counselor ratio, California students are significantly shortchanged in guidance—especially critical for first-generation students who lack a college-educated adult in their family to help navigate the process.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "In today’s global economy, postsecondary education is increasingly vital to individual success, as well as to our country’s future. The knowledge, experience and skills attained through postsecondary education help sustain our workforce, which keeps the United States competitive in the global marketplace. There was a time when a high school diploma was all that was necessary to work at an auto plant or factory and earn enough to support a family. That time has passed.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "School Partners (listed above): Because of the embedded nature of our systemic model, strong partnerships with schools are necessary; we deliberately nurture relationships at multiple levels of leadership. Even when changes in personnel have occurred, we have been able to maintain our services because College Summit has become entrenched in the culture of schools.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Percentage of community college students completing a certificate, degree, or transfer-related program in six years",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "College Summit significantly impacts students who are college-capable and potentially the first in their families to enroll in college but lack the presence of college-experienced adults to help them with the college and financial aid application processes.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. When College Summit was created in 1996 at a teen center in the basement of a low-income housing project in Washington, DC, the center’s director, J.B. Schramm, saw dozens of college-capable kids not even considering college. Many had survived difficult life circumstances – homelessness, neglect, caring for young siblings or ill parents – and had developed smart instincts and deep determination. But the students lacked the know-how and the belief that they could go to college. In his work with this small group of students, Schramm recognized that building their college knowledge was the easy part. Convincing students to believe they could go to college was far more of a challenge. Schramm realized that the person most influential to a 17-year-old was not a teacher or a parent, and certainly not their teen center director. It was another 17-year-old. As influential students overcame hurdles in the college admissions process, other students gained confidence, too. So Schramm, in collaboration with an experienced youth development specialist, created a workshop model that would leverage this power of peer influence.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "College Summit has nearly 20 years of experience in the college access field. Since taking root in Southern California in 2002, more than 15,000 students in the Los Angeles metropolitan area have benefited. For its innovation and results, in 2012, College Summit was named to Forbes Magazine Impact 30 list of top global social entrepreneurs; recognized in 2010 by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for the top nonprofit-business partnership in the country (shared with Deloitte); five-time winner of the Social Capitalist Award from Fast Company Magazine; and founder J.B. Schramm was named \"U.S. Social Entrepreneur of the Year\" at the 2007 World Economic Forum in Davos.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Working with new partners: Most of our veteran schools such as Arleta High, Morningside High, Inglewood High and Sylmar High continue to surpass each of the milestone categories compared to the previous year. However, it is typical for us to see schools experience growing pains in the first year of partnership. So we address this with several strategies, including assigning a School Partnership Manager to spend more time on the campus to continue individualized training and support the educators; and designating Peer Leaders to help work with younger students in Launch classrooms.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "College Summit will provide comprehensive tools, services, and support to help 4,800 low-income students plan for college and career.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "1. 3,000 students in grades 9-11 explore and build competencies to prepare them to successfully navigate the college application process in their senior year."

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The evaluation of the LA Bridge Project has been funded through a generous $358,545 grant from The Michael & Susan Dell Foundation. The overarching program goal is to create a cogent student educational pipeline (an integrated network of pre-schools, K-12 institutions, and higher education systems that prepare students for seamless transitions between high school, higher education institutions, and the workforce). The three explicit metrics that anchor our work are: (1) to increase college matriculation rates to 75% (compared to high poverty schools’ average of 54% and LAUSD’s 62%), (2) to decrease the academic remediation rate to 33% (compared to CSULA’s average of 61%), and (3) to increase the college persistence rate to 80% (compared to CUSLA’s average of 63%).",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Create a seamless transition linking high schools & colleges so LAUSD students can enroll in and graduate from postsecondary institutions",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The LA Bridge Project brings together HS teachers and college professors to co-teach college level courses that offer students the opportunity to bypass academic remediation. Students who successfully complete these classes earn college credit and satisfy all remediation requirements at all 23 CSU’s. This is critical as a major factor that hinders students’ ability to graduate from college is the high rate of academic remediation. Specifically, 1.7 million students nationwide place in remedial college classes annually at a staggering cost of $3 billion to states and the Federal government. This program is poised to be scaled-up to the five CSUs in LA County (CSULA, CSULB, CSUN, CSUDH, & Cal Poly Pomona).",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "The Los Angeles Bridge Project will help to make LA the best place to learn by alleviating the college remediation problem early and at the root. The immediate impact of this program is having LAUSD students graduate from high school college-ready. The long-term impact is that low-income Angelenos will be afforded the social mobility that comes with earning a college degree. LA County will also benefit from this project, in the long-term, in that we will have a highly educated and skilled workforce.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The LA Bridge Project grew out of the doctoral work of our founder, Dr. Lynn Cevallos. Her dissertation at UCLA entitled, “Best Practices of P-20 Partnerships Designed to Increase College Access and Persistence for Under-represented Students” laid the groundwork for College Bridge’s theory of change. Simultaneously it also anchored our partnerships in the best practices she uncovered. As such, the three overarching lessons that guide our project are: (1) structure transparent partnerships in order to foster accountability and sustainability, (2) find champions for the work, and (3) focus on student needs.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The two major challenges we anticipate with the LA Bridge Project are: (1) ensuring buy-in from all stakeholders across each partner institution and (2) the potential to scale-up too quickly. The strategy we have developed in order to ameliorate these potential problems is to anchor all of our work on the best practices of successful P-20 partnerships. Specifically, we will ensure transparency and include all stakeholders during every step of the project. This is critical in order to galvanize the champions within each partner institution to move the partnership work forward while committing key resources from their individual organizations.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Students who place in remediation are less likely to graduate from college. Unfortunately, under-represented students are most likely to place in remedial courses and thus the probability that they will earn a college degree drop off sharply. This has a destructive effect on individuals and their communities by perpetuating the cycle of trans-generational poverty. The remediation dilemma is particularly pervasive across the largest public university system in the nation, the CSU, which spends close to $30 million annually on remediation resulting in lower graduation rates. This project tackles the remediation crisis in 3 new ways: (1) linking the work of HS teachers & college professors, (2) offering concurrent enrollment courses to students who are typically excluded, and (3) creating a sustainable and scalable solution.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The LA Bridge Project will benefit under-represented (minority, low-income, first-generation college) students from LAUSD. Specifically, we serve students residing in Downtown, East and South Los Angeles through CSULA, the San Fernando Valley through CSUN, and the South Bay through CSUDH. We target the lowest performing schools in the most economically disadvantaged areas of the school district. The median household income of the families in these communities is $22,650. As a result, 46% of them live below the poverty line and on average 99% of the students in these areas are eligible for free or reduced lunch. On average, only 54% of our students matriculate in post-secondary institutions compared to the school district average of 62% and the national average of 63%. We strategically target students who have college aspirations but not necessarily the strongest academic or attendance records.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The three explicit metrics that anchor our work are: (1) to increase college matriculation rates to 75% (compared to high poverty schools’ average of 54% and LAUSD’s 62%), (2) to decrease the academic remediation rate to 33% (compared to CSULA’s average of 61%), and (3) to increase the college persistence rate to 80% (compared to CUSLA’s average of 63%).",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The LA Bridge Project’s success to date and the deep ties with LAUSD have been powerful incentives in encouraging CSUN and CSUDH to join the partnership. Specifically, the original pilot project at Santee Education Complex significantly decreased the college math remediation rate. In the fall of 2013, 83% of Santee’s students who enrolled as freshmen at any CSU required remediation in math. After this intervention, however, only 24% of students may require any math remediation at all. The other 76% have officially demonstrated readiness for college-level math by passing CSULA’s MATH 109 (Statistics and Quantitative Reasoning) course. In fact, our students beat CSULA’s 2012 average pass rate for this course by 11 percentage points.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The Los Angeles Bridge Project began as a strategic partnership between LAUSD, CSULA, and College Bridge in the 2013-2014 school year. The initial pilot focused only on mathematics. Due to the significant early success of this program, CSULA scaled the project to an additional high school and added English for the 2014-2015 school year. MOUs are in place with CSULA and LAUSD. Additionally, we plan to scale-up through the north and south LAUSD service areas with CSUN and CSUDH. CSUN are confirmed partners with the MOU pending. CSUDH is in the early stages of partnership development.",

In 2050?": "The educator’s most important task—to shape a humane, well-educated citizenry— has never been more vital to sustain civil society, democratic values, and human rights than it is today. Yet education on the whole seems to be failing in this task; the reality for urban schools is particularly bleak:",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We launched the LA Partnership Schools Network in response to a need from teachers to collaborate and build bridges among the diverse communities that make up Los Angeles. Our primary partnership is with each individual school, including a contractual agreement signed by an administrator and designated teacher liaison on campus. Facing History staff work with faculty at each school to integrate our program across grades and disciplines. Clear contracting, high-fidelity implementation and sustainability planning are all critical elements of a successful collaboration.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Facing History’s approach draws on innovative research and development in the areas of urban education. That research informs both our programs and our measures of success. For the LA Partnership Schools, Facing History will track the number of educators who implement our program and the number of participants in cross-school and community events through our relationship management database. Program staff will closely monitor the activities of, and solicit ongoing feedback from, the partnership schools and teacher liaisons through individual contact and online engagement. Measurable outcomes of this initiative include:",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "In the education field, annual pink-slip notices and uncertainty about job security have taken a toll on educator morale. With budget cuts, not only have teachers lost income through furloughs, they are also asked to do more because schools are functioning with fewer staff and resources than before. These conditions have an impact on teachers’ capacity and willingness to participate in after-school activities, including meetings and workshops. PD providers often need to cover teacher stipends to participate in professional development. We have successfully made stipends available to participants in our Partnership Schools Network for select activities (or substitute teacher coverage so that they can attend during the school day.) In addition, we have changed our workshop strategy to provide contracted offerings with schools and districts who recruit a critical mass of qualified participants.",

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Since 1976, Facing History has worked directly with teachers and schools to build the knowledge, commitment, and motivation for effective civic participation and to develop strong, safe school communities where students can thrive. We have learned that working with whole schools, which then serve as models for deep and innovative implementation of Facing History across grade levels and disciplines, enables the program to improve not only academic learning but school culture as well. Launched in 2008, Facing History’s Innovative Schools Network (ISN) is a group of 60 schools employing a robust whole-school model that impacts the culture of the entire school. Facing History works intensively with faculty on curriculum development, school-wide programming, and whole-staff engagement, resulting in school communities that take seriously issues of ethics, social responsibility, prejudice, and justice, and share a common language that encourages the identification and discussion of these issues—in the classroom, in student advisory and student leadership groups, in staff meetings, and in the broader community. Evaluations of Facing History’s ISN schools provide evidence for the program’s strong impact on teacher efficacy (teachers’ beliefs about their knowledge, and skills in their subject areas, a critical underpinning of high quality teaching); school climate (culture change in terms of language, behavior, and attitude changes across the community of each school); and student outcomes including improved social emotional learning, civic learning, intergroup awareness, ethical reflection and self awareness.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Facing History reaches students through their teachers, providing professional development (PD) to help middle and high school educators explore issues such as discrimination, stereotyping, and the importance of civic participation through curriculum-based critical analysis of historical case studies. Facing History’s PD includes workshops, seminars, classroom resources, and on-going follow-up services. In-depth training introduces teachers to topics such as the steps that led to the Holocaust, race and membership in American history, the Armenian Genocide, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. This training, paired with individualized coaching and follow-up support, prepares educators to use these case studies to engage students around the importance of civic participation.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Los Angeles Partnership Schools Network will provide training and support for approximately 500 teachers in 31 middle and high schools this year. These educators will then reach an estimated 12,000 students across Los Angeles annually with the tools and lessons to participate positively in their school communities, and to succeed in school, career, and civic life. Current partnership network schools are located in East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, downtown, and the San Fernando Valley. All schools are Title I, high poverty schools and all are either public or charter schools within Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Seven middle schools joined the network this past year through a pilot project focused on school-wide anti-bullying practices.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "HS student proficiency in English & Language Arts and Math",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Facing History’s impact has been documented through more than 140 evaluation studies, including quasi-experimental studies and peer reviewed randomized controlled trials. Results prove that our program improves students’ academic engagement, critical-thinking skills and historical understanding, encourages civic participation, and creates safe and engaging classroom and whole-school environments. Definitive evidence shows that Facing History helps to create effective teachers who improve their students’ academic performance and civic learning. Educational leaders, funders, and the federal government are looking for ways to transform education by promoting teacher effectiveness, which a growing body of research confirms is a strong factor in student achievement.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Since establishing our Los Angeles Partnership Schools Network, we have focused our efforts at schools where we have leadership to support our work. We have exceeded our goals thus far, growing from four schools in 2009 to 21 schools today. Partnership schools agree to have at least one teacher attend a week-long immersive seminar who commits by contract to teach a full Facing History curriculum unit in the classroom; arrange for faculty-wide in-services facilitated by Facing History staff; participate in cross-school activities within the network; and create a school-wide action plan to create a culture of safety and inclusion in their school communities assisted by Facing History program staff.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Facing History and Ourselves is poised to scale its Los Angeles Partnership Schools Network, a highly successful pilot serving a critical need among underserved schools to create safe, inclusive environments of empathy and respect that activate students’ sense that their choices matter, and that they can make a difference in their communities. We currently partner with 21 urban middle and high schools across LA, integrating Facing History across grade levels and disciplines, and convening to share ideas and challenges. Our proven method increases teacher effectiveness, improves student engagement and school climate, and ultimately, leads to whole school change. Our goal is to add 10 new schools serving 12,000 new students next year."

Once we have identified individuals who share our vision and can speak about the project’s goals we will be able to change any antagonistic views which NIMBYs at times cultivate. NIMBYS (not in my back yard) who often have a negative perspective on community change and revitalization efforts scheduled to occur in close proximity to their home can sometimes constrain progress. All of our community meetings will be open to the public therefore if NIMBYs aggressively stand against progress or if a collective forms to counter our goals we will have to negotiate to our best ability and bring them to our side. Often times we have learned by listening to their concerns and informing them how we can come to a solution that suffices both of our groups we can proceed as scheduled.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The project will benefit the densely populated communities living in close proximity to four connected streets (Devonshire St., Canterbury Ave., Van Nuys Blvd., and San Fernando Rd.) , approximately a 7 mile distance. All stakeholders ranging from households, to educators, to business owners will benefit. When residents feel safe to walk in their neighborhoods instead of jumping into their car, residents will re-familiarize themselves with the type of pedestrian friendly culture they or their older relatives’ experience before coming to this country.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Access to healthy food",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "It is important to understand the residents experience using the local environment as their choice for exercise, mobility and their connection to the community and nature. Quantitative and qualitative measurements will be gathered by developing pre and post-tests. We will also gather feedback on the urban trail map’s purpose and verify if it is user friendly.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "For families to minimize their carbon footprint and enhance their well-being by revitalizing sidewalks into xeriscape urban trails. In the East San Fernando Valley, a California native plant garden exists called the Nature Parkway. We plan to extend it to permeable sidewalk to increase walkability and connect families to local parks, schools, gardens, bike paths and businesses. Urban trail maps will be distributed through various sources to heighten the level of awareness of the community’s natural habitat and safe streets for accessible recreation. Signage on the Nature Parkway will educate folks on the type of plants used, mile marks will help track users' fitness goals and local businesses will see increased foot traffic.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Historically the East San Fernando Valley experienced racial segregation and continuous resource disparities which negatively affected the built environment and health of its residents. In one of the target neighborhoods, Pacoima, residents experience some of the highest rates of obesity (17%) and asthma (20%.) Our neighborhoods are park poor (54 acres) and decades of unregulated business activity attributed to increased levels of toxicity. Specifically, this project’s safe urban trails will bring together Pacoima, Arleta and Mission Hills through safe walkable sidewalks. Stakeholders will have an aesthetic drought resistant landscaped path that is long term self-sustaining, uses minimal water, while restoring the user’s health and balancing the eco-system. Urban trail maps will help all visitors and locals to recognize and use the revitalized environment which helps to make them feel safer, healthier and better connected to the services and goods they require. Together we will put more eyes on the street and leave the car in the garage.",

First we will re-engage the Friends of the Nature Parkway made up of community groups, organizations, businesses, students and residents who were instrumental in establishing the Nature Parkway and still are involved in maintaining the urban trail. The first phase of community dialogue events will inform the local community about how to get involved with revitalizing their sidewalk spaces into safe urban trails. Surveys will be collected to inform us the extent of current sidewalk space utilization.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "This project aims to enhance the residents’ well -being and revitalize the environment. By doing so there will be more active residents exercising or simply increase the amount of time they spent outside of their homes to enjoy their community. By referring to the urban trail map residents from all ages will get to know where to access healthy food options, where to begin their routine walk, run, skate or bike ride all while enjoying the shade and light breeze currently provided by the existing environment.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We plan to hit the road running. The first month would be to regroup the Friends of the Nature Parkway, which includes all the representatives from the confirmed organizations who have a vested interest in there being more urban trails in the East San Fernando Valley. Together we were able to complete the first trail of the Nature Parkway in less than 6 months. Important discussions and decisions will be formed around the budget, implementation of a timeline and securing resources including volunteers. Once the strategy is developed we will be able to carry through a detailed marketing campaign that increases the community’s awareness and engages them to participate. By starting with a strategy meeting we will be able to identify and bring the right team to the table so that we each understand our role to reach our goal of increased safe urban trails to increase walkability , enhance the community’s wellness and revitalize their public spaces.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "Literacy will always be the cornerstone of learning – today and in 2050. When children can read, doors open. Illiteracy deprives students of a more lucrative, bright future. We are dedicated to providing children struggling with challenges in disadvantaged neighborhoods with the motivation they need to read. We envision all children – especially minority and low-income children – improving their and others’ lives because of our literacy program. If inspired at an early age to enjoy reading and understand the importance of being a contributing member of society, children will lead more productive and responsible adult lives and make L.A. the best place to learn.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have had more than 13 years of experience implementing this project in 150 elementary schools in Southern California, an average of 11 per year.

The only thing limiting our bringing it to additional schools is sufficient funding.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Working with school schedules remains our biggest challenge. Low-achieving public schools face many pressures from districts, state government and parents as they cope with the introduction of the Common Core curriculum. They need to understand that when they take on the Reading Makes A Difference program they partner with a collaborator who will help them make learning much more meaningful for students, exciting children about reading and caring about others at the same time. They need to understand that the sooner they schedule the program, the more rapidly their students will find joy, meaning and new ideas in books that will have lifetime value. Student immersion in reading to help others will pay dividends on many levels, both in the personal lives of students and in the community at large.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Through our 6-week project, elementary students in low-income neighborhoods are motivated to read and help others, developing empathy and reading skills.

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Seemingly unrelated medical and educational experiences have come together to inform our Reading Makes A Difference project. The heart of our project stems from author-artist David Saltzman’s ability to personally inspire children (and adults) of all ages. When David underwent an excruciating bone marrow transplant at UCLA Medical Center in 1989, he had an opportunity to interact with two 7-year-olds being treated for cancer. David told them the story of “The Jester Has Lost His Jingle” and wouldn’t let the boys leave until they were laughing. To keep them smiling, he took out his drawing pad and drew a special Jester & Pharley for each. That morning – six months before David’s death – his mother realized that her son’s book would help all children coping with cancer and other serious medical and life challenges. She vowed to find a way to give “The Jester” to them."

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "For 2015 and beyond, KYCC will lead a VITA collaborative with Chinatown Service Center (CSC), East LA Community Corporation (ELACC), Mexican American Opportunity Foundation (MAOF), Children’s Institute (CII), and 19 City of Los Angeles FamilySource Centers (FSCs). This collaborative is confirmed, and we have been working together as an informal VITA collaborative for the past few years.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "KYCC’s VITA collaborative already has formal commitments from 23 VITA site providers including CSC, ELACC, MAOF, CII, and 19 City of Los Angeles FamilySource Centers to work together to provide coordinated and unified VITA services throughout Los Angeles County. We will work together in all aspects of VITA programming, from recruiting, training and assigning volunteers to providing direct tax preparation services to low-income clients. To begin the volunteer recruitment, KYCC has already begun laying the foundation by conducting a meeting with a number of potential partners regarding viability of such a project (over 20 different nonprofit organizations, schools and government entities came to the meeting including the IRS, Los Angeles County, Los Angeles City, FDIC, and AARP). We have commitments from two colleges (UCLA Extension and Cal State Long Beach) to provide volunteers, and we have a long history of working with local financial institutions (Hanmi Bank, Far East National Bank, and other members of FDIC’s Alliance for Economic Inclusion) to recruit and train volunteers. More specifically, KYCC is currently spearheading an effort with FDIC’s Alliance for Economic Inclusion (network of over 60 banks and nonprofit members) to increase the volunteer base for VITA, and this will ensure that our goal of coordinated volunteer management gets done within the next 12 months. With funding, KYCC will be able to focus on developing the volunteer management infrastructure, to recruit, train and connect volunteers with VITA opportunities. Creating this infrastructure will allow KYCC and the VITA collaborative to build a true collaboration and volunteer pool that will continue into the second year and beyond, till 2050.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "KYCC anticipates the following two major challenges in implementing a coordinated volunteer management program for our VITA collaborative. The first challenge is a technical one. Unlike “Earn It, Keep It, Save It” in the Bay Area, for example, Los Angeles does not have a single place where VITA volunteers can sign up for and get their assignments. Although there may be a simple fix such as creating a website, there are many logistical details that need to be coordinated and solved before an elegant website can handle all VITA volunteer sign ups and schedule assignments. KYCC anticipates dealing with this challenge by designating a Volunteer Coordinator who will work with the VITA collaborative to manage the logistical details required to set up a comprehensive volunteer management system for VITA services in Los Angeles. The Volunteer Coordinator will do the research necessary to see if a website is necessary or if a Google calendar or something akin to that can be utilized to make volunteer sign ups and assignments unified and efficient for all 24 VITA collaborative partners.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Bringing $46 million back to low-income working families in Los Angeles through volunteer-driven free tax preparation services.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Did you know that thousands of volunteers throughout the United States drive one of the most effective anti-poverty strategies in the country? Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program utilizes IRS trained and certified volunteers to provide free income tax filing to low- and moderate-income taxpayers, connecting these working families with deductions and refundable tax credits without losing a single cent to tax preparation fees. In our vision of a civically engaged and connected Los Angeles in 2050, Koreatown Youth and Community Center (KYCC) will work with schools, corporations, nonprofit organizations and government entities to build a VITA collaborative in Los Angeles and work with over 500 volunteers for the 2015 tax season.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "KYCC and our VITA collaborative will directly benefit low- and very low-income residents of Los Angeles, who are oftentimes linguistically isolated (monolingual Spanish, Korean or Chinese speakers) or have other barriers (cultural, educational, etc.) hindering access to basic and/or mainstream financial services. For example, KYCC and our partner VITA organizations work primarily within Los Angeles’ low-income areas such as Koreatown, Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Chinatown, El Sereno, and Lincoln Heights. These areas are home primarily to a majority of Latino residents as well as other immigrant groups such as Koreans and Chinese; as immigrant communities, many of these residents speak little to no English and have difficulty accessing mainstream services such as banking and even government benefits. Additionally, these neighborhoods tend to have much higher poverty rate than the rest of Los Angeles County. For example, in Koreatown, the estimated median household income in 2008 was $27,438 with 45% of residents falling below the federal poverty line. In Boyle Heights, for another example, the family poverty level is nearly three times the state average (28.4% vs. 9.8%) with high incidences of foreclosures and low homeownership rates compared with Los Angeles County (23% vs. 47.8%). Moreover, City of Los Angeles FamilySource Centers are located in the most economically distressed areas of the city and specifically provide comprehensive academic and economic development services to low-income residents of those areas. Overall, most of the residents are working poor that live paycheck to paycheck and are not ready for any financial emergencies.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "1. Rates of volunteerism. KYCC’s VITA collaborative will conduct outreach and marketing to encourage and recruit volunteers for the 2015 VITA program. Through these efforts, more and more Angelenos will find out about our volunteer opportunities and how they can positively impact the lives of low-income, working neighbors in Los Angeles. This will foster more Angelenos to volunteer their time with the VITA program.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "The following two lessons have informed KYCC. First, since 2006, KYCC has been a VITA provider and have worked informally as a collaborative with other nonprofit organizations throughout Los Angeles. Through this experience, KYCC worked with a nonprofit organization in South Los Angeles to establish a VITA site there. For the past three years, KYCC has been working with this South LA organization but throughout that entire time, there has been only one volunteer who was able to dedicate his time and effort to serving South Los Angeles. The difficulty in recruiting and assigning volunteers to South Los Angeles taught us that, while KYCC always had a volunteer recruitment plan, other VITA sites were not as fortunate due to lack of resources that hindered creation of a volunteer program. We also learned that, although KYCC had an abundance of volunteers at our Koreatown sites, those volunteers were reluctant to go to another organization in an unfamiliar part of town. The need for a coordinated and unified volunteer recruitment, training and assignment system throughout Los Angeles was developed through KYCC’s experiences working with VITA volunteers since 2006.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "KYCC has been a successful VITA provider since 2006, serving over 20,000 low-income families throughout Central Los Angeles and returning more than $17.5 million in refunds back to the families that we serve. Although these are impressive numbers, there is more that KYCC can and will do. In Los Angeles County, there were 2.6 million tax returns filed with the IRS in 2012. Among them, 28.13% were self prepared, 70.28% were paid prepared, and 1.56% were volunteer prepared. The last figure is telling. Of all of the taxpayers eligible for free VITA services in Los Angeles County, only 1.56% took advantage of the program. Why is this the case? Unlike San Francisco or New York where there are coordinated VITA infrastructures, Los Angeles lacks such coordination. Through our proposed collaborative, KYCC will bring such unified services and structure to the VITA programs throughout Los Angeles County.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Envision a Los Angeles where Angelenos care about one another – today and in 2050. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program is about more than free tax preparation. Volunteers who commit to VITA go through rigorous training and dedicate many hours from January to April to work with low-income working families, helping them connect with hundreds and thousands of dollars in refunds that not only help the families financially but also feed the local economy. By inspiring over 500 volunteers to commit to VITA in 2015, KYCC will begin the process of bringing a culture of compassion and helping one another to Los Angeles. Through our VITA collaborative’s volunteer program, each VITA volunteer will know the impact that they are making in the lives of each of the low-income, working families who receive VITA services. For example, each volunteer will learn that, in 2014, VITA volunteers completed 44,575 tax returns in Los Angeles County for a refund of almost $46 million back to our families (and the local economy). Volunteers will feel good about the difference that they are making in the lives of their neighbors and continue to make VITA an annual volunteer commitment.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "We know that Los Angeles’ educators in schools and libraries are dedicated, hard working, and committed to the most important job in the world - teaching. Educators have shared with us their desire to incorporate 21st century skill development into their learning environments. The Exploratory:Maker Guilds will propel Los Angeles educators on the path to making Los Angeles the hub for learning. This challenge will ask students to invent something that solves a problem or addresses a need using design thinking techniques like brainstorming, research, ideation and prototyping while learning new technologies and tools, and finally, presenting their invention at the LA Convention Center.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Tinker.Make.Innovate Challenge will directly benefit 100 librarians and educators, and 3000+ students throughout Los Angeles. Through the Google community and the challenge manual, thousands more students will be able to take part in the challenge in their schools and libraries. The showcase has the potential to benefit 40,000 students, families, educators, and community members by inspiring them and opening their eyes to the possibilities of STEM. As this program continues beyond the 2015 funding year, it has the power to inspire the 687,534 students enrolled in LAUSD schools, over 30,000 teachers, and more than 100 librarians in Los Angeles County directly.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "District-wide graduation rates: By providing teachers and librarians with curriculum which incorporates hands-on inquiry based learning, we are empowering them to more deeply engage their students in their learning process. When students are more engaged in their learning, their desire to come to school and stay in school increases. This lowers truancy rates, suspension and expulsion rates, and also increases district wide graduation rates.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "To date, we have facilitated over 40 workshops at 21 libraries, all have been filled up with waiting lists. The workshops have served over 600 students and families throughout Greater Los Angeles County. We have received many requests from librarians to hold professional development workshops and trainings so that they can fulfill their community’s desire for more hands-on learning.",

    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Our first lesson was in teachers' needs. We began working in this field in 2012, and we have found that most teachers don't need equipment loans alone. Instead, they need technical support, meaning they need someone to show them how to use the equipment and they need someone to repair and maintain that equipment. Many teachers have plenty of lab equipment from previous administrations, but are simply unaware of their wealth: the equipment is often old, neglected, unrecognized, or in disrepair. By hours spent, we have found that half of our time has been spent in helping teachers to identify, inventory and repair items in their existing lab equipment collections.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One major challenge will be finding the teachers at times when they are available and ready to work with us. Our main strategy has been to visit teachers during their preparatory period or during lunch; we've found that many teachers are remarkably busy with students after school and some are needed at home immediately after school. Glen, the project founder, is the most knowledgeable person we've got on science lab equipment and its care / use / repair. Therefore, another strategy that we may need to employ would be to hire and to train an advanced undergraduate work-study student through our fiscal sponsor's relationship with local universities. We would have to bring that student rapidly up to speed on science lab activities, with the goal of sending that person to meet with new teacher collaborators independently yet productively.",

Four of these five are confirmed collaborators (one of the five will move to a more well-equipped school where she may no longer require our services). This grant would empower us to increase our impact with our confirmed collaborators into greater significance for their students. The grant would also allow us increase the number of our collaborators by triple or more.",

We look forward to welcoming new participants over the next 12 months and to building and unveiling exciting new aspects of these programs.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "District-wide graduation rates",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The need for conflict resolution education is tremendous, especially on school campuses. A 2011 survey found that 29% of Los Angeles high school students were involved in at least one physical fight (nearly half of those fights were on school grounds) in the past year. Nearly 8% of students reported missing at least one day out of the last 30 because they felt unsafe at or on the way to school.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Where do kids spend most of their childhood? They’re in school, in class with a teacher and other students. Conflicts are inevitable; they are expected. But resolving disputes, even small ones, isn’t always easy...or even taught. Instead schools are often frightening, hostile places where discipline is counter-productive. Earlier this year, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan spoke about the impact of widespread use of suspensions – which are disproportionately given to minority students: “...that the school-to-prison pipeline appears to start as early as 4-year-olds, before kindergarten, should absolutely horrify us.”",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "WJC Institute for Safe and Inclusive Schools trains teachers and students to address bias and bullying and to resolve disputes positively.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "WJC will use pre-and post-training surveys to measure success. We’ll use quantitative and qualitative data about our programs. We’ll also use publicly available data about truancy, suspension and expulsion rates for LA County and for individual schools that we are working with.",

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Groceryships increases access to healthy food by coaching families in navigating the food system. Over the course of six months of grocery stipends, people in under-resourced areas learn where and how to find and prepare nourishing meals despite external obstacles. In tandem with our comprehensive wellness classes, obesity rates decrease as lifestyle shifts take place. Groceryships’ unique holistic approach supports emotional well-being and mental health by strengthening interpersonal relationships and providing a safe space to de-stress and process trauma. The vital bonds developed in our rooms empower members of low-income communities to harness their collective strength in response to adverse events.",

After six months working with us to improve their health, those 10 families recruit 10 more families, and serve as mentors. The cycle continues each season, as stakeholders spread practices of healthy living throughout their networks. So, over time, we organically grow a robust oasis of wellness in food deserts, empowering communities to nurture future generations’ bodies, minds and hearts.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Homeboy Industries has mentored us from the early stages of our program, providing advice and support in developing our concept. In October, we are launching our first class together, connecting their twenty-six years of experience, highly motivated members, and proven success with our innovative strategy. This is a mutually beneficial partnership, allowing us to transform the relationship with food for Homeboy employees, explore a different facet of the wellness emphasized by Homeboy, and introduce our curriculum to a new neighborhood.",

In 2050?": "Among the 18.9 million adults with a substance use disorder in the past year, almost half had a co-occurring mental illness. However, only 7.4% of individuals receive treatment for both conditions and 55.8% receive no treatment at all. Due to the Affordable Care Act, 640,000 people in Los Angeles County are estimated to be eligible for Medi-Cal and 10% of them will need treatment for substance use disorders. This impacts Los Angeles as untreated addiction and mental illness can lead to unemployment, incarceration, child abuse or neglect, homelessness and a cycle of poverty for many families.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Hundreds of women- those with children, those without, those who are expecting and those who have recently given birth- are brought down by addiction and its myriad challenges. Their issues are often so complex; they have nowhere else to go since many traditional programs may only offer one type of treatment.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA), or health care reform, remains the single most important event that will impact Prototypes over the course of this next year. It will benefit the communities we serve by increasing access to insurance for individuals seeking substance use and mental health treatment, as these services are now essential health benefits under the ACA. Access to preventive care, coverage for pre-existing conditions for families, and required coverage for pregnant and postpartum women will also directly benefit Prototypes’ clients in a positive way. Health care reform also presents many uncertainties in public funding and policies. At both the State and County levels, there are many unknowns as the reforms are implemented this year, making it extremely difficult in developing a long-term strategy for funding. We work closely with our government funders to stay abreast of the latest developments and to ensure our voice is heard.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Money (financial capital)",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Over the years, Prototypes has developed a deep network of government and social services that help us meet the needs of our clients.

This includes vocational training, employment support, and educational classes a to ensure women have their GED, can gain work experience and pursue higher education. In addition, women are provided life-skills that such as budgeting and nutrition to prepare them to create a stable household. Staff also help clients secure any public benefits and resources.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "First, Prototypes has helped more than 100,000 individuals lead healthy and productive lives since 1986. This extensive experience has allowed Prototypes to refine our service model to best help the communities we serve. As the issues and population changes over time, Prototypes deep connections within the areas we serve helps stay abreast of changes to meet the needs of our clients. This has led to increasingly integrated services and a program that is intense in order to help our clients become self-sufficient. Currently, healthcare reform has changed how people access care and demands that medical and behavioral health care become integrated. That is why we have identified a need for a Health Care Navigator to assist families with everything from insurance to meeting doctor’s appointments.",

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "The project will provide participants the ability to create and transform the built environment, a human right, and connect users and space to create sustainable places destined for success and systemic sustainability. This type of learning applies Architecture as a social mechanism that stimulates the sensory system, affecting intellect and desire to create by means of spatial languages and computer technologies. The project provides innovative templates to create spaces, objects, and solutions for local needs and motivates the untapped talent of visual thinkers in our communities. It provides a nurturing environment where learning can happen in the context of doing. It provides safe, environmentally sustainable places in which to live, work and play; places to learn, worship, meet, govern, shop and eat. Private or public, indoors or outdoors, rooms, buildings or complexes this project’s built environment will include neighborhoods, towns, suburbs and cities. A key impact is, for the first time, more people will participate in the transformation and creation of the place they live, work, move, create. The Built Environment is the perfect canvas for learning. The study of Architecture has been very narrow and prevented people from learning and participating in the life cycle of our city, buildings, campuses and neighborhoods. Our students will apply the art and the science of creating such spaces and products. Basic and universal needs will inspire innovative designs and transform needs into evolutionary and participatory reality through the life cycle of the building from concept to construction, operation, maintenance and assessment. The project will be a parallel and collaborative effort to current practices in Architecture. The impact will be the inclusion of stronger social concerns and the ability to react to location and space. It will create, augment, and connect residents with a sustainable environment through more people participating in making and creating the built environment.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Higher education, socio-economic leaders and local communities will benefit from synergetic thinking and an integrated approach. Learning will transpire in the context of doing and purpose. Multiple efforts including National Intelligence, local neighborhood first response and Americans with Disabilities will benefit by having local models of how to connect higher education with their communities. Also benefiting will be all students and partners currently participating in our program and the ENCOUNTER Network. This new synergetic learning will catalyze our neighborhoods and our higher education system. With the new lenses of GIS/BIM and 3D modeling and visualizing, the area’s workforce will benefit by facilitation of an unprecedented analytical and comprehensive means of looking at human-made ecosystems. We will benefit by creating a sustainable workforce that will see patterns and relationships never before seen and they will help all sustain on the planet. Currently untapped members of the workforce will be helped via a butterfly effect to present, document, design, and ideate their contribution to the system. to engage, volunteer and participate in decision making. To empower our population, we need to help them contribute in meaningfully civic process with their own passion and purpose. I believe every person has a mission in life and my job is to help them find it and develop it. We need to help them present, document, design, and ideate their contribution to the system.

    "organization": "EnrichLA",
    "summary": "We are building 11 new gardens that will receive our Garden Ranger Program - offering garden based ed to THOUSANDS of LA kids!",
    "goal": "PLAY",
    "projectRanking": "Winner",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Our LA2050 project is to reach a goal of building 75 edible school gardens in Los Angeles schools! To accomplish this, we will build 11 new edible gardens and offer the Garden Ranger Program at 11 new schools!",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "EnrichLA has a significant track record for designing, building, and providing programming at schools across Los Angeles. Within the last 3 years, EnrichLA has built over 60 gardens in Los Angeles schools, and in the 2013-2014 school year, we offered our Garden Ranger Program at 25 schools.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "Our motto is to put “A Garden in Every School” and thereby with every school garden we create, we are offering students, parents, teachers, and community members the opportunity to play, and with that play, to live and learn. The beauty of our endeavor is that with every garden we create, we are in effect establishing an incubator for new opportunities; for communities to come together over a garden work day, for teachers to become stewards of the environment, and for children to become acquainted, by the sweat of their own brow, with those fruits and vegetables that will most nourish them.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Through our experience with building school gardens and offering garden education at Los Angeles Schools, we have discovered a variety of benefits, some un-planned.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "In three years, EnrichLA has established edible gardens in over 60 schools and has successfully implemented our Garden Ranger Program at 25 schools. With an average of 21 schools a year, we are confident that adding 11 more gardens/green spaces and 11 more Garden Ranger programs in Los Angeles is an achievable goal.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "EnrichLA has worked with over 60 schools to design and build edible school gardens. We have a good relationship with LAUSD facilities and with school staff and administrators. Over the last 3 years, we have proven what we are able to accomplish and we have no doubt that we have in place a streamlined process for bringing edible school gardens and garden programming to Los Angeles schools.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "EnrichLA will reach our goal of building 75 school gardens, and will offer our Garden Ranger Program to at least 5,500 additional students!",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The expansion of our Garden Ranger Program to eleven new schools will offer the program to a minimum of 5,500 students who previously lacked access to a school garden and to our Garden Ranger Program.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "EnrichLA has worked with partners such as Kaiser Permanente, St. Johns Wellness Center, LAUSD Facilities, Whole Foods, Whole Kids Foundation, Tree People, and more. EnrichLA is open to new and continuing partnerships as we hope to partner with like-minded organizations concerned with offering edible education and green spaces to local students.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 PLAY metrics?": "Access to open space and park facilities",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "EnrichLA will refine some existing methods of evaluation and roll out some new methods during the 2014-2015 school year.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Proposed collaboration (we want to work with partners!)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "EnrichLA has a particular interest in building edible school gardens in some of Los Angeles' most park-poor communities. Many of our schools are built in areas with little to no green space. Our school gardens change that.",

    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Arts LANDed is an artist residency program for public schools and online resource mapping/connecting people to local art experiences.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a population of LA County)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "LAND’s continued vision is to help create and foster a multi-platform connectivity within Los Angeles and beyond, ultimately creating an international web linking institutions, artists, and cities. Arts LANDed will create this in literal form in an online platform, and expand our reach into an educational program connecting students, teachers, artists, and neighborhoods together, benefitting these specific groups and the general public.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. Past education programs LAND has undertaken working with schools and community groups in conjunction with major Los Angeles public art projects very much inform this project. These projects differed greatly – Wildflowering L.A. by artist Fritz Haeg was a decentralized environmental art project hosted by three elementary and secondary schools at their school sites, as part of a larger project of 50 dispersed sites across Los Angeles County, and Painting in Place was a more contemporary installation by multiple artists at the historic Farmers and Merchants Bank in downtown Los Angeles. Both further opened ideas about how to translate LAND’s contemporary public art projects to a broader population. With Wildflowering L.A. in particular, students were invested in the project from participating in the planting process through to collecting seeds at the end of season, watching the bloom daily and developing a personal bond with an onsite work of art that was then utilized by teachers for lessons on pollinators (science/health), for community garden days (social cohesion), writing or drawing about observations (science/language arts), and learning about the artist’s past work (art history/public art). At Painting in Place, centrally located on Main Street and 4th in Downtown L.A., we outreached and planned programs led by artists and a museum educator to bring students and children from area shelters in to the space to see the show, and administrators were hoping for similar programs on that level, particularly ones that were walkable from their schools, as limited bus transportation is often a barrier for going on field trips.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1. Website access issues for some families –",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "LAND’s process for the 2-part project will be straightforward, with the pilot artist-residency program mirroring the future possibilities of the website. For the artist-in-residence program, LAND will approach ten arts organizations, artist-run spaces, &/or artists to partner on the project. Working with the arts organizations whom we select & who self select for interest in the project, we will partner with schools walking distance from the arts organization. If a STEAM or VAPA school is in the vicinity, we will approach those schools first. Together with the artists, we will network in the community by attending meetings/gatherings, connecting with parent groups at the school, & building relationships with educators. We will talk with teachers about style, grade level, standards, & curriculum. The educator & artist will design a project that works for the school semester – from a performance art piece or collaborative sculpture, to more traditional printmaking, claywork, or mural, to a final exhibition for the current programming. This process will take 2 to 3 intensive months of relationship building, aiming to launch the residency at the start. LAND will act as a liaison & support for the artist. The program also includes visits to the art space, led by a museum educator who LAND will contract with for the art space & to provide mentorship to the artists-in-residence.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Arts LANDed is a neighborhood-based artist-in-residence program at local schools & an ongoing event resource aggregator/mapping website for teachers & families to find & attend art events near where they teach, work, or live. Using existing resources from LA County’s Arts for All to ForYourArt, Arts LANDed leverages the worthy data produced to become a hands-on program on contemporary art for teachers, artists, & students at LAUSD schools. The goal is to nurture a new generation of artists & thinkers by providing an infrastructure for teachers to connect with local arts organizations, supplement curriculum with field trips or artist visits & access the living classroom of everyday LA.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "At the root of Arts LANDed is generating/promoting creation and artistic sustainability by educating the next generation. The program will informally and formally link LA’s significant creative production to schools and educators interested in further developing and integrating arts into their curriculum on a neighborhood level as a part of everyday life.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "As LAND does not have a permanent exhibition space, we approach all projects and programs as collaborations. LAND will partner with Los Angeles-based arts organizations to include them in Arts LANDed, by integrating their current exhibitions and programming onto the website, and offering the resources to be involved in the education program, particularly as it relates to upcoming exhibitions or with artists that live/work nearby. In the past we have partnered with institutions including MOCA, The Getty, LACMA, the Hammer Museum, MOLAA, and the MAK Center to engage a large and diverse public audience at multiple sites throughout Los Angeles. We would approach institutions such as these, along with smaller organizations as well, to be involved in the project, offering students access to the highest caliber institutions in Los Angeles. These programming partners are not confirmed at this stage in the project, but given our past relationships, we feel confident that they would be interested in taking part in this program. We would also approach other colleagues and organizations we have not yet had the chance to work with and would be thrilled to do so, such as The Mistake Room, LACE, LA>",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "As mentioned above, the process will take 3 intensive months of relationship building from September-December 2014 as soon as this school year starts, aiming to launch the artist/school residency component at the start of January 2015 for the spring semester. LAND has existing relationships with art spaces as well as schools (many from the Wildflowering L.A. project who either participated or did not have opportunity to do so due to time constraints), and this period will be one of site visits, meetings, & assessing the right fits. During these three months, LAND and Matt Murphy Design/Athletics will work intensively on brainstorming and defining a website, particularly for mapping and the RSS feed. LAND will utilize existing resources, such as Arts for LA’s asset map and the LA County Arts Commission’s Spacefinder, as well as do further research on art spaces. The second phase will be from January-May 2015. During this time, LAND will support the school artist programs on an administrative level, liaising between the arts organizations & school & visiting the programs to observe & assist. The website will be under full development and in beta at this time so that the pilot schools will be able to use the site, ideally providing ongoing feedback on its structure & usability.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Rates of volunteerism: The program will encourage other local artists to volunteer to assist the artist in residency, and community volunteers and parents will likely volunteer to assist with art projects/lessons.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Participant feedback on the programs will indicate success within each school. This expanded audience for LAND will enable student exposure to in-depth art experiences, and will increase the artist and collaborating organizations’ position within the local art community."

    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Ours is a community of mostly 20- and 30-somethings, who’ve each experienced significant loss, and get together over Dinner Parties to talk about it and the ways in which continues to affect our lives. Some of us have lost parents; others, siblings, partners, or friends. For some of us, it’s been six months, for others, sixteen years. Some of us are actively grieving, others not. Our identities and labels include gay, straight, women, men, unmarried, married, of varying backgrounds, creeds, and economic strata. Some of us have struggled in visible ways, grappling with depression, or eating disorders, or general listlessness. Others were simply leading what author Parker Palmer calls, “divided lives”: compelled to cover up a key part of themselves.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The first major barrier has to do with internal capacity, particularly when it comes to match-making. Over the last few months, demand has vastly exceeded supply, both in terms of our ability to find and equip hosts, and in terms of our own match-making capacity. By building out our local team (in the form of adding a stipended Host Mentor and Local Coordinator), we hope to dramatically increase our ability to quickly and efficiently connect folks with similar interests to existing tables, and to start new ones as needed. In the long-term, we’re also exploring what a digital match-making platform might look like, through which people who've experienced significant loss can find and connect with existing Dinner Party hosts, or otherwise start tables of their own (think Meet-up meets OkCupid).",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today?

Project, low-income Angelenos map to jobs, a safe home, and a better future for their families by partnering with volunteer Advocates-- trained problem-solvers who work with Members to set and achieve goals. Using our innovative feedback tool, Constituent Voice, we can show that by strengthening all three aspects of members’ multi-dimensional well-being (personal, social, and financial foundations), people are more likely to achieve greater sustained economic mobility and stability. Results will influence other LA social service organizations to adopt a more human-centered approach to addressing poverty.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "As one of LIFT’s seminal values is collaboration, an essential part of our model is creating reciprocal partnerships with strong social service organizations to provide comprehensive member service.

He comes to LIFT-LA with extensive experience in public policy advocacy in South LA. Senior Development Manager, Jessica Vom Steeg, comes to LIFT most recently from Chrysalis, where she managed individual and corporate giving.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Care: Our approach is driven by a network of volunteer advocates who work to help people who often lack the resources and networks of support they need to overcome crises and get ahead.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Because it’s hard for anyone to find the right tools when navigating a complex system on their own, each of our members is paired with an advocate who sticks with them as they build the skills and access the resources needed to achieve economic stability. Advocates become the social network for disenfranchised Angelenos, providing one-on-one support and helping them connect to their community. The advocate engages the member in a goal-setting process to chart their own path to stability, based on immediate needs (e.g. shelter, food) and long-term aspirations (e.g. employment, affordable housing). During the process, they help build members’ confidence, connect to resources and support networks, and navigate to self-determined success.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. “I've battled poverty and disability in Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Glendale, and I thought, \"What are they going to be able to do for me, these young kids?\" I still wasn't sold on using volunteer college students. I was expecting a social worker like almost all agencies. But after my first appointment, I finally got why it could be successful. She [the advocate] had a great zest and enthusiasm, and a fabulous knowledge of databases—a young generation without the experience but the brainpower and hope and no loss of spirit, because it hasn't been beaten out of them. It's a different pace, a complete positive belief that it can get better that let me get out of any sense of hopelessness. My possibilities were wider. If I was with a traditional social worker, I'm positive we'd never thought about this program that's allowing me to buy a house.” – Niki, LIFT member. LIFT offers one of the most unique, transformative, and impactful volunteer engagement models in the nonprofit sector. College students have traditionally been underutilized in the social service sector despite their ability and eagerness to donate vast amounts of time, passion, and dedication to the cause. From technological prowess to expert research abilities, students have a wealth of knowledge and skills that are directly applicable to the needs of low-income communities.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1. While engaging a large proportion of college students as volunteer advocates in LIFT is an incredible asset to our work, there are also challenges inherent in college schedules. Member appointments are more limited during these weeks, making it difficult for members to continue making progress on their goals. To address these challenges, LIFT-LA has focused on engaging more professionals and non-traditional to diversify our volunteer pool and address this gap in service. We will also host group workshops for our members during these times (like job interview preparation or financial aid workshops for parents). LIFT-LA advocates and staff continue to create innovative solutions and strategies to address lower volunteer office capacity during these weeks."

We provide weekly hour-long sessions in which two or three IW theatre artists lead fifteen mental health patients in structured exercises, based on acting and playwriting training techniques, that lead the patients to create fictional characters far removed from themselves, improvise and write scenes and sometimes whole plays featuring those characters, and finally to embody those characters on stage, in a professionally mounted production, staged and designed by professional theater arts.Among the results of this experience for the patients are often improved social skills, enhanced performance in job interviews, and higher self-esteem, all buttressed by the accomplishment of writing and acting in a play. Scientific studies at the UCLA Semel Institute have proven these results.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "One hundred homeless veterans and veterans suffering PTSD have a series of 20 weekly structured hour-long meetings (in groups of 15) where they are mentored by professional theater artists (actors, writers, directors) in the creation of four original theater works, which are then mounted professionally for the general public in Los Angeles professional theater venues, and are performed by the veterans and professional actors together, under the direction of a professional theater directer and produced by a professional theater producer.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "Scientific testing at the UCLA Semel Institute has shown that among those who suffer mental illness, participation in Imagination Workshop's theater workshops for the mentally ill leads to a higher functioning, better life, which includes improved social skills, higher functioning in job interviews, the establishing of ego boundaries through the experience of creating and embodying fictional characters, better participation in groups and programs, and the ability to stay out of the hospital. Our work with homeless veterans and those suffering PTSD in the past has been very successful and helped hundreds of vets live fuller lives. By helping 100 Los Angeles veterans live healthier lives, we help La become the healthiest place to live today. By creating a continuing program that reaches out and serves this many vets every year, we help make a heathy LA in 2050."

    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "Our project will increase open space and parks. The LA Promise Zone in Central Los Angeles is one of the densest communities in the City, but has little green space and few options for play. Over 70% of Zone residents do not live within 1/4 mile of a park. Los Angeles is the most “park poor” of major cities in the United States. While Los Angeles has 9.1 acres of park per 1,000 residents (compared to 4.6 acres per 1,000 for New York), parks are less equitably distributed in LA. The vast majority of children in New York (91%) and Boston (97%) live within walking distance of a park, compared to only 33% in LA (The Trust for Public Land, No Place to Play, 2004). The LA Promise Zone has even fewer park spaces, with only 30% of residents living within walking distance of a park, demonstrating a great need for additional parks and recreation spaces that will help make LA the best place to play today.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "LA Schools to Parks aims to create safe and vibrant play spaces for Angelinos in the LA Promise Zone by transforming schools to parks.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The project will most directly benefit over 32,000 families currently living in the Promise Zone, the majority of whom lack access to parks and open space within walking distance. 70% of Promise Zone residents (113,082) do not live within 1/4 mile of a park, which reflects the inequitable distribution of parks and open space in the City of Los Angeles. These residents are expected to use the new parks and will most directly benefit from the project.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 PLAY metrics?": "Residents within 1⁄4 mile of a park (Dream Metric)",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Barriers and challenges include full implementation and maintenance of services at each school to ensure growing park use. This will require funding to cover custodial services to ensure school campuses remain clean and usable during both school and park hours. Additional support is needed at structured parks to provide formal programs and intergenerational activities. YPI will seek support from private funders for this. This is particularly important when implementing structural changes to schools that become parks, such as turning pavement and concrete into grass fields for recreational use. Funding sources locally and broadly to be solicited include City of LA Neighborhood Councils, the 50 Parks Initiative, Safe Routes and community development funds, school district bond measures and the LAUSD SEEDS program, as well as federal funding for which the LA Promise Zone will use its designation to receive preference.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "LA Schools to Parks will increase community parks in the LA Promise Zone by working with schools to open their outdoor recreation space to the community on weekends and in summer. Currently only 30% of Zone residents live within 1/4 mile walk to a park. The goal of LA Schools to Parks is to double this within one year, so that 60% of residents live within 1/4 mile walk to a park and can enjoy recreation, exercise and play.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "YPI (the Promise Zone Lead Implementation Partner and Lead Agency for the LA Promise Neighborhood) works with the City of Los Angeles, the Lead Agency for the Promise Zone and a confirmed partner. The City of LA will leverage services provided by LA Recreation and Parks for newly created parks, including arts and sports offered at Recreation Centers, Summer Night Lights (a program that provides after-dark recreational and jobs for youth in City parks during summer), and intergenerational programs.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Two lessons inform the LA Schools to Parks movement. The first is the critical importance of collaboration and partnerships to make projects of this type succeed. The recruitment and involvement of stakeholders are a vital part of defining and examining available options and services when developing parks and resources implemented through a neighborhood visioning process. In this way, the new parks will reflect needs and interests of residents and the neighborhood which will contribute to their long-term sustainability. Each school transformed into a park needs to engender strong support from the community. The best way to do this is to make sure that residents take a leading role in the design and implementation of services and programs. YPI and partners such as People for Parks have strong experience in working with residents to reflect bottom up change. In Promise Neighborhoods planning, for example, YPI worked with residents to define needed services through 3,444 completed surveys, 29 focus groups, 27 work groups, and 22 asset mapping walks, while People for Parks has successfully opened three LAUSD schools as community parks to date.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The project will work with partners and residents to move the number of residents within 1/4 mile from a park from its current 30% to 60%. The first six months will be a planning phase to select and open target schools. A strong component will be consideration of LA Promise Neighborhood schools as potential sites, given multiple programs and services already offered at schools and their status as \"Full-Service Community Schools\" with existing YPI staff to support park services.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "LA-based nonprofit agency Youth Policy Institute (YPI) will create safe and vibrant play spaces for Angelinos. The LA Promise Zone lacks parks and green space. The solution? Leverage partnerships and community involvement to transform public schools into parks, open to residents and families on weekends and the summer.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "LA Schools to Parks will make a significant impact on four of the above metrics, helping to move the needle on providing Angelenos with safe, vibrant spaces for recreation. We will work with schools to open up their campuses on the weekends and during summer to serve as additional recreational park spaces.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "YPI considers the LA Schools to Parks project to be a success when we double the number of residents in the Promise Zone who live within 1/4 mile of a park/recreational space by 2015. We will measure success using the four metrics described in the section \"How will your project impact the LA 2050 \"Play\" metrics?\" These include doubling the number of the residents who live within 1/4 mile of a park from 30% of Promise Zone residents to 60% of Promise Zone residents. Success also means doubling the number of residents with easy access to a vibrant park from 48,434 residents to 97,403. The project will also seek to increase the \"vibrancy\" of recreational spaces by implementing community-driven beautification projects on the 12 school campuses. These may include building gardens, planting trees or painting murals. This will also support improving the quality of informal play spaces, and we will further measure success by whether we achieve increasing the number of informal play spaces by 12. Similarly, LA Schools to Parks will increase the number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities by 12 by providing intergenerational recreation programs at the schools that will be opened up as parks."

LA’s BEST can measure youth levels of social isolation and levels of safety as much in school as in their communities. Also, we will track the types of social actions they engage in to promote safety in their communities. Finally, 80 youth will be involved in the proposed project through the after school programs at the elementary school and high school levels.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Connecting for Success was developed specifically for children served by LA’s BEST by Development Without Limits (DWL), an organization led by the former Director of Staff Development at LA’s BEST, in collaboration with LA’s BEST stakeholders, and in consultation with renowned psychiatrist Dr. Mark Goulston. CFS provides LA’s BEST field staff with comprehensive training and tools to help upper grade elementary school students make healthy life decisions, especially when they are dealing with stress or other mental and emotional challenges, and to reduce tolerance for violence within their own neighborhoods, all while promoting global and civic consciousness. The original curriculum uses the devastating problem of landmines and their impact on children in countries where they exist—particularly in Colombia—as an entry point and catalyst to encourage students to think and talk about similarities and differences between their lives in urban Los Angeles communities and the lives of their counterparts in Colombia. For example, local gangs use guns, violence and intimidation to establish their territory in Los Angeles, while drug cartels in Colombia use landmines to secure their cocaine fields. Both scenarios create climates of fear, and harm the innocent. As a result, children and families are not able to function freely within their own community. The latest version of CFS curriculum also incorporates the global issues of food security and justice in Haiti and the environment in China, which further facilitate the expansion of participants’ perspective and empathy.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "LA’s BEST has experience in implementing not only this curriculum but others designed to foster socioemotional development in youth at the elementary school level. We have a cadre of trained staff ready to begin the work with this particular set of elementary schools. We have already begun to establish relationships with staff from the high school and are ready to begin talks to recruit high school participants. Thus, with experienced trainers, a curriculum in hand, sites for implementation, we believe that the goal is clearly achievable.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Because Connecting for Success curriculum addresses serious global issues that are not generally discussed with children, LA’s BEST will combat perceptions that the program is too “heavy” for elementary school students. In addition, implementation of the proposed project will require dedication of significant internal resources, including staff time. Since LA’s BEST delivers a wide array of out-of-school-time education, enrichment, and recreation programming in benefit of more than 28,000 children in need each day, the organization faces challenges related to competing priorities. An LA2050 Initiative grant will help LA’s BEST overcome this challenge by allowing us to dedicate financial and human resources to effectively execute the proposed project.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "Through the proposed project, children will have access to after school enrichment programming and LA’s BEST will help people of all ages residing in Los Angeles feel safe while in their homes, neighborhoods, and places to play. As a result, residents will be more likely to access public spaces and develop an overall sense of community and love for their neighborhoods.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "LA’s BEST has developed Connecting for Success (CFS): A Guide for Building Healthy After School Communities, an innovative curriculum designed to connected youth to others by building skills in empathy, self-control and both social and emotional self-awareness. By taking students on journeys addressing basic problems of violence, food shortages and environmental degradation, the curriculum supports development of an understanding of the origins of these social issues along with development of age-appropriate social actions.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Direct project beneficiaries include 20 local High School students, 60 children who attend three LAUSD elementary schools located in under-resourced communities, five LA’s BEST field staff, and one local high school counselor. Indirect project beneficiaries include the overall student body, staff, and faculty at local high school, as well as their families and the surrounding community, and the student bodies, staffs, and faculties at the three LAUSD elementary schools located in neighborhoods plagued by crime and poverty, as well as their families and residents of the surrounding neighborhoods.

For example, a third of LA’s kids lack access to preschool opportunities, less than 50 percent of 3rd graders score proficiently on English language arts standardized tests, and nearly 1 in 6 dropout of high school.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "LA is the vital center of the Movement. Children Now opened an office in downtown LA last year and brought on full-time staff to start scaling our model throughout LA. We are also building this innovative model in other communities throughout the State, but given LA’s size and diversity, it is imperative that the Movement is scaled here. LA is the ideal place to be the most connected for children’s advocacy, because if the Movement is scaled here, there is no excuse for not scaling it throughout California, and, then, given California’s size and diversity, throughout the country.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The Children’s Movement targets the wide array of health, education, and child welfare policy issues that affect children. As such, this project will benefit all children in Los Angeles, and especially the high percentages of children who are low-income (over 50%), English learners, and of color, as these children often face a disproportionate number of barriers to attaining the necessary quality education and health supports. Without these supports, these children are at risk for not being prepared for work, college and life.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "This past year, we have employed The Children’s Movement to leverage the implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), California’s new school finance model, for the benefit of our earliest learners in LA. The Movement provided timely materials and direct technical assistance to Movement members to inform and strengthen their local efforts. A key resource that we developed and distributed through the Movement was the “Leveraging the LCFF: Making the case for Early Learning and Development (ELD) in your school district” primer and toolkit. This resource provides stakeholders from across the education spectrum with a concrete base of knowledge on (1) the LCFF, (2) research supported benefits of ELD, (3) district budget timelines and insights, and (4) strategies to infuse ELD into the new Local Control Accountability Plans (LCAP) that are required under LCFF. At the same time, we regularly connected with local advocates in Los Angeles to provide strategic advice on when to launch local advocacy efforts, how to develop and deploy effective messaging to local school leaders, and support on developing the budget/program request.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Collaboration and connecting partners is the core of the Movement. What differentiates the Movement other models is that we are not just building coalitions among the advocacy groups that are already active on individual children’s issues, but we are (1) breaking down the siloes among those existing coalitions to generate broad support for each issue, and (2) expanding children’s advocacy to be inclusive of populations and groups that are rarely invited to be part of this conversation – such as individual businesses, community groups and faith-based congregations.",

These indicators are based on a 100% scale – i.e. all kids being proficient in reading by 3rd grade, 3- and 4-year olds who attend preschool, children who have health insurance for the entire year, children who visited a dentist in the last year, children in the child welfare system who have stability in their placement, among others, so we will measure success by getting to as close to 100% as possible for each of these indicators.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "While many organizations work on kid’s issues, they are often focused either on specific issues or specific communities within greater Los Angeles (or both). One of the primary challenges of this project will be to effectively “de-silo” the field to work collaboratively for the benefit of children as a whole. In addition, one of the barriers these organizations face to taking collective action is their limited capacity and resources to effectively engaging in local and state-level policymaking.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementing our project in the next 12 months is an achievable goal because we start with a base of LA members and a track record of success on a number of Movement campaign efforts.",

    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "We are connecting the incredible constituency power that exists for kids in LA to influence state & local policymaking in their favor.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Changing government policies is the fastest and most efficient way to scale effective programs and ensure the resources needed to provide all children with the necessary supports. What stands in the way of these necessary policy actions is the lack of connection. While there are countless organizations, businesses, and individuals in LA that care deeply about improving outcomes for youth, most of them tend to operate in siloes, by issue and/or sector. If a significant number of these entities were connected, the power of a unified voice would have an exponential effect and secure powerful policy change for kids."

    "Whom will your project benefit?": "While the City and County of Los Angeles has a vibrant social and fine art scene, the reality is there is a high density of decentralized populations in the greater metropolitan area that is often overlooked: residents who do not have the resources to access a variety of culture and art exchange either because of the price of admission or exclusive settings. Ambulante USA addresses this extreme disparity in accessibility by going directly into these communities to offer interactive documentary events for free, with the consciousness of transforming the cultural exchange to each new geographical and social context."

Artists of all types are drawn to the County and many use their art to advance causes including achieving a sustainable future. Maggie Q supports animal welfare and conservation, James Cameron produces the TV series The Years of Living Dangerously, G2Gallery offers wildlife art and donates all proceeds to animal causes, Connie Samaras has a retrospective at The Armory Center For the Arts. Her images capture the banal nightmares of manmade landscapes. In an article on May 10, 2013 Robby Herbst asked the question, Who Makes Art About Climate Change? He concludes with this hope and prediction re the future in LA with climate change, \"We'll see it in our changed environments, in species decline and extinctions, and in the rise of global instability as many old ways of living are drowned or toasted. Perhaps in the future too, when somebody asks \"who's making art about climate change in Los Angeles,\" the response won't be a head-scratch and a \"geez, I dunno.\" KCET",

Due to the location of our main campus, many of the families we serve come from the Barton Hill/Rancho San Pedro neighborhood of San Pedro. This area is located in the northeast corner of San Pedro—the town’s major core of poverty level families. Seventy-eight percent of Toberman's families are Latino/Hispanic. Currently, 96% of clients are below 50% of area median income, with 58% having incomes of less than $15,000. Many of the families we serve reside in the Rancho San Pedro low-income public housing project, and every student at the local elementary school qualifies for participation in the Federal free lunch program.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our program is producing wonderful outcomes for our families. Not only do our family learning/literacy efforts lead to more children being enrolled in early education programs, but we believe the longer term outcomes for these children will be heightened due to the share literacy component. Our parents are actively engaged with their children during our early education programming and, in fact, are concurrently building and improving their own literacy skills. Regarding truancy, we focus our efforts on building assets using the Search Institute's 40 Developmental Assets® framework. Our children/youth are showing a greater commitment to academics/schoolwork and, with the active involvement of their parents, are experiencing a greater connection to their schools. Grades and reading skills have improved dramatically through our program. In addition, Toberman has a powerful gang intervention program. Our \"safe passage\" program ensures our children arrive at and leave their schools safely. In addition, Penn State is in process of evaluating our first year as a Toyota Family Learning program site. In one month, we will receive a comprehensive evaluation report covering additional areas of our work including parent empowerment, skill development, time spent reading/literacy levels, and technology fluency. We will also have longitudinal data on our early education efforts as we follow the progress of our preschool children through second grade.",

Two critical lessons have informed the development of this program. Firstly, we have learned that we cannot bring about sustained change without supporting the family as a unit. For that reason, each component of our programming involves the active involvement of the family as a whole. As an example, our family literacy programming includes adult education courses (e.g., ESL, financial literacy) and preschool readiness classes, as well as a significant shared parent/child literacy component. Also, our family engagement and family service learning activities aim to strengthen our parents' role in advocating for and educating their children, fortify the family unit and deepen our families' role in the community.",

These enhancements allow us to reach families when the children are young and reverse the effects of poverty, abuse and neglect. Our staff have received extensive professional development in such areas as the effects of poverty, homelessness and domestic violence on children; asset development; and violence intervention. Through the use of an experienced transition team and several expert financial volunteer partners, TNC has achieved risk reduction and improved financial, operational and board efficiency. These foundational structures are positioning our agency to compete for larger and more varied grant funding opportunities, provide us with a clearly defined vision that is highly attractive to donors and the community, more fully capitalize on our staff's expertise/abilities, and, most importantly, substantially improve our program effectiveness and impact through holistic support of families.",

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "AMP provides incoming Alliance college freshman with peer mentors who are successful second and third year Alliance college students. Through regular meetings and coaching which begin in the final semester of high school through the first year of college, mentors provide personal guidance and counseling to support the new college students' seamless transition into college, as well as success in that critical first year of college. AMP builds both mentor and mentee development by encouraging growth in the areas of leadership, communication, self-direction, and problem solving skills. In 2014-15, AMP will expand to include 700 Alliance college freshman and 100 mentors who attend 12 southern California colleges & universities.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Alliance begins by identifying mentors from Alliance alumni who are in their second or third year of college at one of the 12 largest feeder colleges for Alliance graduates. Potential mentors are nominated by Alliance teachers and administrators, interviewed and rated based on their academic success, resilience, campus involvement, time management, and willingness to commit to the program for a year. As the program expands, mentor recruitment will expand to include the existing pool of mentees who have successfully moved on to their second year of college.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "While Alliance has been successful at increasing the high school graduation rates of low-income students in Los Angeles (94% grad rate) and successful in helping our students get accepted to college (95% college acceptance), we have been less successful in preparing them fully for success in college. Alliance alumni persistence rates mirror those of low-income students of color nationally. After several years of tracking our alumni, we discovered 3 important impediments to their success in college – academic preparedness, financial hardship and a social isolation when our students arrive on campus. As a result, Alliance has adjusted several strategies, including curriculum changes that support more writing and offers more intervention and remediation while in high school so students reduce the need for remediation in college. Secondly, our counseling program has increased efforts to support students in identifying and securing financial aid.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "AMP is entering its third year of operations, has developed a well-thought out program and has demonstrated the capacity to scale the program. Three years ago, the program was piloted with 34 mentees and 5 alumni mentors from one Alliance high school who were attending two colleges. Year one focused on curriculum development, evaluating what worked and refinement for the following year. Indeed it was in the year one pilot that Alliance became aware of the “summer melt” problem and adjusted the program so that the first interaction between mentee and mentors occurred while the mentee was still in high school as opposed to the first month of college. In 2013-14, the program expanded to include 189 mentees and 12 mentors from four Alliance high schools who attended four local colleges and universities. The major learning in this year was how to do better mentor – mentee matching. In the 2014-15 year, Alliance has again expanded AMP by adding two program coordinators who serve 520 mentees and 86 mentors from 13 Alliance high schools who attend 12 southern California colleges and universities. In the coming year, identification of new mentors for the 2015-16 school year begins in January of 2015 and new mentees are identified in March of 2015. For 2015-16, we will expand to include 700 mentees and 100 mentors from 14 Alliance high schools. Staffing is in place and the program is a well-organized for continued implementation of the 2014-15 mentee cohort as well as the recruitment of the 2015-16 mentee and mentor cohort.",

    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The immediate beneficiaries of AMP are the low-income students participating in the program -- both the incoming college freshman mentees and second and third year college peer mentors.

    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One challenge includes the early buy-in of some Alliance high school seniors who will attend college the following fall. We could potentially have more students in the program than we currently do. Our goal is to have 60% of the graduating class of all Alliance high schools in the program. We are currently at 40%. As high school students, they often lack understanding of what will be required of them as they transition to college and, frankly, don’t know what they don’t know in terms the help and support they will need. Secondly, students are often reluctant to pair up with “strangers” or people they do not know well. Thirdly, students do not want to be perceived as needing help. To remedy this challenge, the AMP staff are working more closely with the college counselors to introduce AMP to students earlier in the year. We are also brining in past participants in AMP to discuss the benefits of the program with Alliance high school seniors. Finally, we are carefully crafting the program messaging as network support system for all Alliance students vs. individual coaching and support."

    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The Imagined Futures consists of three components: live programming; a sequence of galleries; and an augmented-reality panorama of the city of Los Angeles in the future. We can start work on the first of these today; the other two need custom-designed physical spaces which we will start preparing. The first phase of The Imagined Futures, covered by this grant, is the next year. We will establish ourselves with live programming while finalizing the design for the complete vision. The second phase will implement that vision with the aim of opening the building at the end of 2016. (More on this can be read on our website, http://theimaginedfutures.org)",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "The Imagined Futures should have a strong impact on almost all of the LA2050 Create metrics.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "While this is the first public year for The Imagined Futures, this is a project that we've been working on privately for eighteen months. We've spent the last year speaking to a variety of people – agents, directors, producers, studio heads, writers, people at JPL, CalTech, USC, UCLA, Boeing, Activision, GoogleX, Microsoft, Disney, Disney Imagineering, CAA, National Academy of Sciences, Exxon Mobil, LACMA, Paul Allen's Experience Music Project – who have participated in shaping our ideas as part of the informal working group behind our project. More have expressed confidence in our ability to execute. A museum that celebrates art and technology in LA is a \"no-brainer\", we've been told several times. We've absorbed their input and we're ready to move.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "We're executing on a big plan. While it would be more exciting to immediately open any doors, no matter how small, to the public, we think this project is important enough to be worth doing correctly. We've seen a number of superficially similar projects raise a fair amount of money with Kickstarters, only to fizzle out when they realize that they don't have a greater plan on how to get to the next level.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "First, a personal story. I've been a Big Brother to underprivileged youths in Los Angeles since college. Two summers ago, I suggested to Brent that we could read Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" together: it's a book that I remember loving when I was his age. He didn't know it; he found it hard going at first. But then came an \"aha\" moment: when the vision of the future that Asimov is presenting in that book and its sequels (which he raced through with a speed that astonished everyone) took him over. More than that: the idea that the future was something that could be shaped, that he could have agency over not just his life, turbulent as it might seem, but also the future of society. We talked about that for hours – and he started to see why science and math, unattractive though they might seem, weren't impositions so much as tools that he could use to make something bigger. What happened with Brent isn't that different from what any educator's trying to do. But so many don't get through. I started wondering how we could create \"aha\" moments for ten Brents, a thousand Brents, a million Brents. If we can harness the power of storytelling to get kids on a grand scale to consider STEM disciplines, we should. We'll all benefit.",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Presenting entertaining & educational public events & designing an interactive museum experience to celebrate art, storytelling & tech in LA",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The Imagined Futures is a museum, a classroom, a theater: a space for connecting art, technology, and storytelling. It uses education and entertainment to engage students of all ages by 1) bringing together fictional futures and real-world underpinnings; 2) facilitating discussions about possible futures between scientists, engineers, artists and the public; 3) providing resources for educators who want to interest students in STEM and the creative arts; and 4) considering the impact of imagined futures on L.A. The Imagined Futures consists of 3 areas: galleries containing objects for thinking about the future; live programming, screenings, panels and debates; and an augmented future-vision panorama of Los Angeles created by each visitor.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Primary beneficiaries of The Imagined Futures in its completed form will be visitors. Visitors to The Imagined Futures can be divided into three groups: 1) tourists, as we imagine it becoming a destination like LACMA or the California Science Center; 2) school children, who will visit The Imagined Futures in classroom groups as part of our educational component; and 3) Angelenos, who will return for event programming even if they've already visited the museum component.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "As mentioned above, there's been a tremendous interest in our project. We've formed an informal working group to design the project that includes people working at JPL, Tesla, Google, Disney Imagineering, The X Prize Foundation, and The Hettema Group, as well as writers, film producers, gamemakers, designers, and architects.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "This is the first stage of a multi-year process. In the next year, two steps toward future financial viability need to happen: first, a serious design for the project, and second, a feasibility study based on that design which will tell us how much money we need to raise. Those two things need to happen in the next six months. This is a binary, not a metric.",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Los Angeles has been built on the idea that the future is captivating. Our inexhaustible appetite for science fiction and imaginative entertainment – often created right here in Hollywood – exists because everyone loves thinking about potential futures. Innovation, in both art and sciences, happens because someone looks at the world and imagines how an element of it could be different – and, perhaps, the changes that might come across because of that difference. New products – and works of art – come into being this way all the time. And social change can happen because people imagine better possible futures. By encouraging creative and imaginative thinking, we can cultivate a better future. The Imagined Futures wants to challenge people to explore, predict and imagine the possibilities for the future."

    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "Beautification of building facades, planting of street trees & street landscaping, general enhancement of the ambient environment",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "When originally built the 3 boulevards served the needs of the residents in what was then the premier neighborhood of the movers and shakers of late 19th and early 20th century LA. While many of the historic and diverse homes and apartments in the neighborhood are being lovingly restored, the same cannot be said for the commercial enterprises on these key boulevards. We want to revitalize the commercial nature of the boulevards by attracting new types of businesses to better serve the needs of the residents. We want to create a neighborhood-serving commercial zone that is pedestrian friendly and easily accessible to local residents in one of the most diverse and dynamic communities in Los Angeles.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "The project is going to be a grass roots effort of volunteers and stakeholders who are residents, business operators and property owners in the neighborhood. It will be a collaboration of residents, artists, merchants and owners who share a common vision of an improved and better neighborhood. It will be a bottom up effort to get individuals to take action to improve their properties and to own the improvements. It will rely on sweat equity and donations to plant trees, renovate or install street landscaping, paint buildings and beautify signage to provide an esthetically pleasing environment that serves the needs of the adjacent residents.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "1) More street trees planted and enhanced landscaping, 2) buildings painted/spruced up to enhance visual appeal and 3) increase in the number of merchants, artists and incubator spaces locating in the community. We will use our site to acknowledge the efforts of individuals in these areas and to give them kudos for their efforts. We will visually document progress with before and after photos and/or videos.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Proposed collaboration (we want to work with partners!)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "The current businesses do not reflect the diversity of the current residents and serve only a narrow spectrum of the population. There is ample space available to provide incubator space at affordable rents and to broaden the offering of services, provide creative spaces for artists and vary the types of businesses present. This is the critical combination necessary to create dynamic and attractive city environments as described by Jane Jacobs in her landmark book \"The life and death of great American cities\". The objective is not to \"gentrify\" the neighborhood by displacing current residents and merchants but to enhance what is already here by using vacant or underutilized commercial space and vacant properties to expand services and the types of economic activities and employment opportunities currently available in order to reflect the diversity of the residents to its fullest extent.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The residents, both current and future, will benefit from the greater diversity and beauty of these key corridors that are adjacent to downtown LA and serve as connectors to the West Side. It will enhance and expand revitalization efforts occurring in downtown, South Park and La Brea Ave. Greater presence of people and foot traffic also enhances safety and the sense of community of the residents. The City of LA will benefit as the volunteers will perform many of the services the City can no longer afford to provide at adequate service levels and will result in a better tax base for the City as well. It will also provide more employment opportunities for residents and greater incomes for the merchants. We also expect to enhance the cultural offerings of the neighborhood with the attraction of additional artists and artisans to the neighborhood.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "There are a number of organizations and individuals currently active in the types of endeavors we intend to foster as a grassroots incubator and provider of information, talent and support for the improvement efforts. The West Adams Heritage Association has been active in the area for 30+ years, we have a very strong neighborhood council presence in the community and many individuals are already sponsoring and/or paying out of their own pocket for key preservation, restoration and revitalization activities. The idea of our organization is to bring all of these groups together who have until now not acted in concert. In particular there has not been a conscious and organized effort to reach out to merchants and the owners of the properties. Most revitalization and restoration efforts have focused on the residential aspects of the neighborhood and have not forged the critical link to the business community and commercial property owners, both groups whom we intend to integrate into these projects. As a grassroots effort, we intend to rely on the sweat equity of those in the community. This is to be a bottoms-up effort that will gain momentum from actions taken by others that will inspire new efforts by others. We want the participants to \"own\" the improvements and to inspire others to do their small part that will make an enormous contribution to the community.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CREATE metrics?": "Employment in creative industries",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By empowering current residents and businesses, expanding the range and types of business, attracting new incubator activities and artistic endeavors, the economic prosperity of the area will improve. Currently, residents spend a great portion of their discretionary income in other areas of the City due to a lack of local business that serve the resident's needs. By diversification and expansion of the businesses, we will create more jobs, more employment and more economic prosperity for residents, artists and merchants alike. We are already one of the most ethnically and age diverse communities in the City and this diversity will be a foundation stone in making the community one of the most desirable in the City.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1) Top-down efforts have not worked. If the ideas and efforts do not percolate from the bottom up they will not get any traction.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "We have already been canvassing merchants in the community and they have expressed enthusiasm and support. Many have already started improvement projects and individual residents have adopted trees, parkways and other areas, preserving and improving the plantings and enhancing the ambiance of the area. We will intensify and expand these activities.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1) There will be a fair number of individuals who will not want to take action initially. Our strategy is to identify blocks with a critical mass of interested individuals, who will make the improvements and inspire others by the success of their efforts.",

    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "FLTS prides itself on ensuring communities when we come in to do engagement around a space; they will not just get a plan ,but they will get a PROJECT. We have a 5 for 5 success ratio of community engagement and greenspace projects within a 12 month timeline – it is our internal metric. We are able to do this because we hold true that creating the necessary spaces to green our communities does not have to take years and millions of dollars. With the right partnerships, resources and careful planning, we are able to build and execute projects in short time spans. This is our commitment to the community.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "FLTS will convert a vacant, demoralizing lot in Cypress Park into a community designed pocket park.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to PLAY today? In 2050?": "FLTS has a long standing belief that creating access to greenspaces in park-poor communities doesn’t need to be a process that begins in year 1 and ends with a park opening in year 9. Cypress Park Pocket Park will be a pivotal project in demonstrating that creating access to parks and greenspaces does not need to take years. This model can be easily implemented by agencies, community based organizations and non-profits to create a network of play and greenspaces in their park-poor communities. We are confident this model is a long-term, implementable solution to make LA the best place to play.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "For this project, the pocket park will directly benefit the community of Cypress Park in North east Los Angeles. According to the 2010 Census , Cypress Park has an estimated population of approximately 11, 000 people, among the highest densities in Los Angeles County. In addition, the household median income for the ½ mile radius of the proposed park is $39,559, well below the poverty line.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. The Broken Window Theory. When a vacant lot stays vacant, the whole community is demoralized on a systemic level. Everything is affected from childrens opportunity to play to local economic investment.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "1. Development Setbacks. Every project has a timeline and sometimes contingencies occur that one cannot foresee – such as the irrigation installation is delayed because a water main broke. Or an outdoor community workshop has to be changed because it is raining. How we ensure the success of implementation is to “roll with the punches” as the saying goes. We attempt to anticipate any setbacks however when they occur, FLTS will plan accordingly to ensure the project moves forward.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The idea is to not only activate vacant lots in low income communities, but create long-term solutions to blight and greenspace inequity. From Lot to Spot will convert a 4800 sq.ft vacant, blighted lot into a community-designed, pocket park in Cypress Park featuring local native plants, trees and a walking path. This project will be community designed and built. The once blighted and vacant lot will be a vibrant, active social space in Cypress Park. The pocket park will be a pilot project, to demonstrate how these small, under-utilized vacant spaces can become a network of greenspaces in park-poor areas.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "We believe that successful community projects need a comprehensive collaborative of stakeholders. To ensure this, this project will be a collaborative between three major partners that will provide resources that will engage a comprehensive public. We will be partnering with local community leader and business in Cypress Park - Antigua Coffee House. Yancey Quinones, owner, is a community leader and advocate of creating community-driven, multi-benefit projects that inspire youth in Cypress Park to improve Cypress Park. Antigua Coffee House - located four blocks - from the vacant lot will serve as the community space hosting design workshops.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Cypress Park Pocket Park will be providing access to recreation opportunities to a community that does not have currently have access. According the California Department of Parks and Recreation, there is 1.32 acres of parkspace per 1000 residents within ½ mile radius of the vacant lot.

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The LHHI relies upon data-driven metrics to measure and react to services in real time. Each component of the system: transportation, the community hub, and health services will generate data to evaluate the program individually and collectively.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The overall HEALTH of a community can be understood within a complex system of social determinants. In fact Lincoln Heights can best be defined by the inaccessibility to solutions that are already found within it. Our initiative creates access to existing health infrastructure while building supportive community services. Goals: To promote accessible healthcare and healthy living options for LH residents. Connect local health centers, childcare, schools, low-income housing, and healthy food providers, through a physical network of transportation routes. Foster collaboration among healthcare providers, community members, and local government to implement targeted health programs and infrastructure informed by data-driven best practices.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "This project will create a framework to implement programs that address public health, connectivity, and maximizing local health infrastructure. The logistics will operate as two symbiotic initiatives: the “community hub” and the transportation network. Technology will also play a vital role. Mobile applications can facilitate the efficiency and integration of our programs. Using this technology, a user could purchase fresh produce located at the hub, track and easily access the shuttle service, and communicate with health service centers. This mobile app will also help to collect data, and create metrics of analysis.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Please refer to the following question regarding evaluation, which addresses the above metrics comprehensively.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. Change comes from within: As trained City Planners, we are looking at the entire system of Lincoln Heights and the social determinants of health in the built environment. We are evaluating the impact of large city projects such as investments along the River as well as the community’s access to nutritional food. The bird’s eye view of LH shows a neighborhood that is severed from amenities on all sides. The rail and freeway, implemented during urban renewal from the last century, have bisected historic connections to downtown, LACUSC, and the central business districts to the north. This relative isolation has contributed to the disparities of access that LH experiences and requires innovative engagements to repair these pathways. However, an important lesson for City Planners and developers is that even best intentions have the potential to negatively affect or destroy the culture of a neighborhood. The city’s abundant freeways, meant to move the people and economies throughout the region, resulted in the opposite condition for much of East LA and its residents. The task for many governments and planners in the 21st century has been to undo or transcend the barriers constructed in the previous century. In our view, the solutions should not be imposed upon this community. Rather, we will provide the infrastructure to empower them to dictate their own development.",

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "East LA",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LIVE today? In 2050?": "In LA, mobility is an issue of equity. The size of LA has allowed a great diversity of people to live within its sprawl. The unsustainable compromise, however, is that this lack of density creates areas without adequate support. The result is that entire neighborhoods, often segregated by their socio-economic circumstance, are bereft of services and therefore vulnerable to poor health. In LA, access to transportation can define the health of a community. While the city is making improvements to the subway system, underserved neighborhoods need better pathways to connect to services and the larger transportation network. The LHHI model is designed to create access to health services, supported by community-based transportation and the concentration of public services. The Lincoln Heights’ demographics and risk factors are similar to many areas throughout East and South LA; the impact of creating independent nodes that support health would be profound.",

    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The LHHI will represent a consortium of care providers, business leaders, and community partners that will drive holistic, community-based strategies for achieving a healthy, equitable, and sustainable LH. The initiative combines the best practices of an accountable care organization with a neighborhood improvement district to address simultaneously public health disparities and connectivity concerns. Its mission is informed by the alarming disconnect between the economic and spatial dominance of the LACUSC Med Center and the public health vulnerability of the community.",

    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LIVE metrics?": "Access to healthy food",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementing the LHHI within twelve months is an achievable goal because the majority of the programming and infrastructure already exists. The strength of this initiative is its simplicity. The health institutions are within the neighborhood, yet slightly out of reach. The concentrations of public and residential life, such as metro rail stop and Ramona Gardens Housing Project, are disparately located with negligible pathways between them. Our goals are facilitating connections, rather than remaking the wheel."

    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "We will measure success by evaluating the growth of the organization within its core programs. Specifically, LASC will analyze if we are able to 1) create 8-10 new research projects, 2) partner with 8-12 new collaborators, 3) fund 8-15 graduate students, 4) hire 4 people into entry-level positions, 5) coordinate 8-10 policy briefings, and 6) enroll, train, and help 12-15 students graduate through our NLS program.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "LASC was founded in 2009 by seven young professionals immersed in the Southern California sustainability movement. In addition to unique and fresh ideas, each founding Board Member has distinct expertise from a wide range of professions, including academia, business, law, advocacy, public affairs and communications. We collectively identified two gaps within the local environmental movement: 1) environmental advocates need sound research to make informed decisions and 2) graduate students need real-world working experience. The Los Angeles Sustainability Collaborative (LASC) is the solution: we lead practical academic research and foster tomorrow’s urban environmentalists.",

    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits all of LA County)",
    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "LA area residents will benefit from faster Internet services at lower costs. Some families who couldn't afford any Internet access at all under cable and telco duopoly pricing will gain cost effective network access at home for the first time.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "Any local nonprofit or government institution can transform their own offices, buildings, and campuses into institutional hubs for local community network mesh peer connections and online services. Modern low cost and power-sipping hardware designed for laptops and tablets can easily be transformed into core router and data services infrastructure, all at lower gross long-term costs than any remote Internet cloud services. These online services can be situated directly within the places where they are most used. This both lowers online request latency and increases service reliability. During disasters of any form, in situ renewable power generation and backup batteries can keep this community infrastructure operational while the metropolitan infrastructure is being restored. These institutions and services should always reside at the core of our community networks, not at remote data centers far north or east of Los Angeles County.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The core of the global Internet already runs on mesh routing software systems like OSPF, and ad hoc wireless mesh routing software like OLSR has already been tested internationally. This open source software all runs on open standards hardware like desktop computers and laptops -- the same hardware that is being shrunk into low power tablets, phones, and embedded systems today. The only remaining task is to package up all these innovations together, in a way that anyone can easily install and maintain these connections in their own homes and offices at falling costs.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "A lot of the open standards hardware and open source software required for these private network deployments already exist. We just need to package it all together, in a way that makes it easy for anyone without network expertise to install it in their own homes or offices.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "Global competitive market access today requires fast broadband Internet connections. South Koreans visit major American cities and feel like they're in a remote rural area, where Internet speeds slow down to a crawl. If the US and its largest global cities (like LA) want to catch up, or at least attract digerati tourism, then they need to explore every option to connect all their citizens to gigabit or faster speeds. Renting this core infrastructure from cable and telco monopolists will simply not suffice. Silicon Beach will not wait.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "1. Number of new family homes with online access to local civic and market resources, where such access was nonexistent or unaffordable before.",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The word \"Internet\" is just short for \"interconnected networks\". Anyone can build their own home network, encourage all their neighbors to do the same, and once they connect with each other over shared fence lines (the global network industry calls this \"peering\"), they are suddenly part of their own community internet! By sharing in this property of all networks, we can have the biggest contiguous mesh of Internet connection points in the country. We only each pay for our own network's installation, maintenance costs, and long distance transit. Today we are paying up to 20 times that much, just to rent temporary access from a cable or telephone company's proprietary network. We should each have our own internet instead.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Rates of volunteerism",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Pervasive Internet connectivity and local online community services affect every single metric in every LA 2050 goal.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The US FCC has been a captured regulator since inception, or before inception if you count their predecessor FRA as a separate entity. They may try to limit our ability to connect with each other directly, in favor of the incumbent telco and cable monopolists they serve exclusively today. Their auctions of our public commons resources have never been in our collective public interests. We will use existing open spectrum license and \"light license\" structures to avoid proprietary exclusive spectrum, as previously allocated by the FCC to invisible private fiefdoms against all public interests. Partner organizations with less restrictions on their political activities can also petition their US government to force the FCC to start acting in public interests, instead of for their own \"post regulator career\" private gains.",

This partnership is confirmed and longstanding. The benefits of working with HACoLA is the ability to work directly with site staff to access residents that are college-bound or current college students. HACoLA offers their residents case management, afterschool programming, and clinical psychological services. The relationships that their staff build through these and other programs is a compliment to CDF's programming.",

    "Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?": "Central LA",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "In order to increase college graduation rates of low-income students living in Section 8 and Public Housing, the CDF will continue operating its longstanding HAR Scholarship program. This program has been in operation for 17 years and awards college and vocational training program students with scholarships up to $1,000. By 2019, the CDF plans to increase scholarship size to up to $2,500. Scholarship awards are disbursed to students throughout the school year based on meeting academic milestones.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "Since 1997, the CDF has implemented the HAR Scholarship program annually. Over this time more than $200,000 in scholarships were made, enabling over 200 students to attend an institute of higher education at a more affordable rate. Under new leadership, in 2012 the CDF underwent an evaluation process of the HAR Scholarship program and subsequently a strategic planning process in 2013-14. The main lesson that resulted from the HAR Scholarship evaluation and which further informed the CDF’s strategic planning and program implementation is simple and one that we have all heard growing up: money can’t buy everything.",
    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?": "Project: SCHOLARS will make Los Angeles the best place to learn today by creating an equitable learning environment that all students regardless of income and background can expect to succeed. WIth both financial and emotional support, students will be engaged and posed for success. Additionally, Project: SCHOLARS will make Los Angeles the best place to learn in 2050 by removing the old stigma of Housing Projects being a place for drugs, crime, violence, and fraud. Rather those living in poverty will have the same chance and expectation to succeed academically and in their career as their higher income counterparts because they will have the positive role models as proof. If the least among us, those that have the greatest challenges, can succeed then all of Los Angeles can succeed!",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 LEARN metrics?": "Percentage of community college students completing a certificate, degree, or transfer-related program in six years",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "By ensuring students graduate.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Project: SCHOLARS is a 2014 board-approved comprehensive set of programs and services that aims to create pathways to and through higher education for low-income housing residents of all ages. This goal is met by focusing on four main objectives: 1) creating a college going and career exploring culture; 2) increasing college access; 3) strengthening college retention, persistence, and graduation rates; and 4) preparing students for their chosen career field. This proposal is specifically for our interventions surrounding Objective #3 (college retention, persistence, and graduation) and include: college to career mentorship, college shower, and HAR Scholarships.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "CDF and Project: SCHOLARS benefit a specific sub-population of the Los Angeles Community: low-income housing residents, that is Section 8 and Public Housing residents. In Los Angeles County there are over 100,000 families enrolled in one of these two housing programs. This target population is made up of some of our region’s most disadvantaged youth and families that struggle from more than poverty. The vast majority of low-income residents are economically unstable and vulnerable and have also dealt with extreme adversity such as being formerly homeless, transition age youth (TAY) leaving the foster care system, victims of domestic or sexual violence, physically or mentally disabled, among other challenges. A particularly unique aspect of the CDF’s target population is that there are no age limits, and in fact, the CDF encourages adults to return to higher education. The CDF believes that while it is important to support youth transitioning from high school to college, supporting adults (especially adults with children) can be challenging but is also important to ending generational poverty. Parents returning back to school have the opportunity to not only improve their lives but also the lives of their children. Without Project: SCHOLARS, our clients are at-risk of being stuck in the vicious cycle of generational poverty.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "Implementing the HAR Scholarship, College to Career Mentorship, and College Showers in the next 12 months is an achievable goal as the CDF has developed needed infrastructure. Both the HAR Scholarship and College to Career Mentorship programs are currently in operation.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "The two challenges that the CDF faces in implementing Project: SCHOLARS is outreaching Section 8 residents that are scattered throughout the County and live in market-rate housing. Compared to Public Housing residents, who live in one community, the Section 8 residents are more difficult to engage. We have had great success reaching out Section 8 participants by training staff of the Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles (HACoLA) on CDF’s available programs, handing out flyers in HACoLA’s lobby, and hanging posters. Additionally, most Housing Authorities operate a program entitled Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) which guides residents to become economically self-sufficient through education and employment opportunities. Participants of the FSS program are often eager to learn about new opportunities and participate in CDF’s programs."

An initial site will be based on visibility, site suitability, and safety. The potential sculpture themes will be developed by Conant-Moran Design and Fabrication. The Sculptures will be designed, fabricated and installed by Conant-Moran Inc.. The themes for the sculptures will be contemporary and will be readily recognized as things the community recognizes. Potential sculptures include Nintendo controller, Etch-a-sketch, Lego Man, Jacks, Light Bright, Tetris and similar ideas. The sculpture are approximately 10 times actual size. Implementation is not complex. The decisions needed are straight forward. Fabrication of the metal structures is a one person job. It is important that this application does not imply more complexity than there will be.",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "The collaborators for this project are local leaders and District 9 staff who will assist with site selection and the unveiling BBQ's. These collaborators are not specifically named. They will be contacted as sculpture projects are developed. The number of collaboration participants will be small because the primary beneficiaries live and work in the immediate neighborhood.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1. Installation of sculpture on 58th and Broadway and the reaction of the neighborhood.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "At a minimum a sculpture can be completed and installed every 1 1/2 to 2 months. This schedule is acceptable to the artist.",
    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "The project is intended to benefit those who live and work in the community. The benefits are quality of life issues that are improved by positive changes to the environment. Those positively affected by the addition of art to the environment runs the gamut from old to young, male and female, business owner to the unemployed, rich and poor. Any positive change in the environment or culture directly or indirectly changes things for the good - for everyone.",

    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "Predominately through the installation of metal sculptures. The target is six to ten. Involvement of the community. Measured by response to the BBQ's and party.",
    "What resources does your project need?": "Network/relationship support",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "Six to ten metal sculptures will be placed in neighborhoods with the intent to enhance public spaces and introduce art into a culture that is otherwise barren of community-based art. The unveiling will BBQ be proceeded by a Community BBQ and Family oriented entertainment. The project illustrates that art can be a source of pride for the community and will serve as a landmark for conversation and neighborhood identification. A pilot project has been initiated at 58th and Broadway where a Rubik's Cube metal sculpture has been installed. The public acceptance and positive reception has encouraged this application for funds. The fact that the sculpture has not been vandalized is testament to high public regard for the art.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?": "Presently, there is an obvious lack of public art and likewise lack of appreciation of art. The grantee has experimented with placement of artistic pieces in public areas and has noted the inquisitiveness, attention, and curiosity of those who live and work in the neighborhood. Revitalization of a neighborhood must include instilling or creating pride in the neighborhood. The sculpture pieces are intended to be the focal point of neighborhood pride. The sculptures are intended as a seed for the future. Any change in the culture of a community is preceded by a change in the environment. A piece of art occupying a small space can have a big role in changing perspectives of individuals who otherwise may not have their artistic inquisitiveness piqued. Whether someone is walking by, riding by in a personal vehicle or mass transit, or on a bike or skate board, a glance which captures an art piece can transform thoughts from day to day concerns to \"what if\". The sculptures are being presented as a first step and not an end-all. We cannot pretend to predict the future, but we can guide the change by contributing positive changed to the urban environment. Installing a simple piece of art on a street corner has changed one neighborhood at Broadway and 58th, and can be replicated to change more communities. Like the story of the person throwing small starfish into the ocean, small action, but it makes a big difference to the starfish.",

    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "The youth we serve commonly share their feelings of invisibility, isolation, and insignificance and generally don’t have a positive vision for themselves or their future. In spite of this, they express a desire to use their experiences to create social change and improve their communities. The Invisible to Invincible campaign utilizes positive youth development, leadership activities, and internships to create change. By providing an opportunity for youth to engage in, and lead, this campaign, Jovenes is creating an innovative and effective model for engagement with homeless youth that taps into their resiliency and capacity for personal growth, permanent change, and invincibility.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "1)\tPermanent Housing is the only way to end homelessness. For the first 20 years that Jovenes has been around, we were only able to offer short-term shelter programs to our youth. It’s unrealistic to expect homeless youth who have gone through so many traumas to turn their lives around in 90 days, or even 8 months. It didn’t provide our youth with enough time and support to recover, increase their self-confidence, build trusting relationships, visualize their goals, and put in place a plan of action. We also learned from emerging best practices and were noticing the shift in federal policies that are really emphasizing permanent housing over shelter services. It was our moment to make strategic decisions that would provide our agency with the best opportunity to grow, and provide our youth with the best opportunities to succeed.",

As Jovenes continues to expand our housing capacity, we also seek to identify and address policies and systems that push youth into homelessness or which contribute to the challenges they face as they seek to move their lives forward.",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "This program will be evaluated by the number of internship opportunities Jovenes is able to create, the number of youth Jovenes is able to connect to leadership and storytelling activities, and our ability to affect policy and systems change. A major challenge is operating this campaign is its uniqueness; it is very rare for homeless youth to be engaged in this manner. As youth are participating in these internships, they are still working on a personal level to overcome the challenges associated with homelessness.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "The Invisible to Invincible Campaign is an on-going project that started in March 2014. Support from LA 2050 will supercharge this initiative and take our public awareness efforts to the next level. Jovenes seeks to continually hire and train interns to participate in this campaign and staff the Wellness Center office. Goals for the campaign are to hold screenings of the documentary From Invisible to Invincible at least twice per month, as well as organize events and forums on topics that are related to this campaign (such as a healthcare forum targeting at-risk youth to help and encourage them to obtain healthcare).",

In the public schools surrounding Jovenes, we have learned that there are over 1,000 students who face housing instability. Although the youth we serve come from diverse backgrounds, common barriers to a stable future are found throughout our target population.

By continuing to create permanent housing opportunities for youth, Jovenes will play our part in our city’s ongoing efforts to end homelessness. By demonstrating how our organization is successfully implementing private and public partnerships, we can show how other communities and organizations can follow our model. Jovenes is seeking to do the majority of our work in Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles- two communities that are especially resilient by face long-standing economic and social justice challenges.

LGBTQ students in particular are at far greater risk of dropping out of school and they experience depression, violence, harassment, substance use and addiction, homelessness, HIV infection, and the ultimate tragedy – suicide – at much higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts. Together with LAUSD, we want to ensure we are working collaboratively to support our students and staff sending the message that it’s safe to be you in our schools. In addition, Project SPIN will benefit many other members of our community – teachers, principals, families, police officers, bus drivers, and the other individuals that will be given the tools necessary to create a safe and inclusive environment for LGBTQ youth.",

The Los Angeles LGBT Center is the largest LGBT organization in the world and has been at the forefront in offering services to LGBTQ youth and, in particular, at-risk youth. By working with LAUSD and in collaboration with a variety of other organizations and communities, Project SPIN will collectively create an environment in all district schools where students feel safe to come to school, be true to themselves, and advance in both their education and careers. Project SPIN’s curriculum and response training, systemic and policy restructuring, and unified support of all people in our community can create a 2050 Los Angeles where mindsets are shifted, equality is achieved, and internal happiness and justice is restored for the marginalized youth that are presently suffering so many deficits.

    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Project SPIN focuses in four areas to achieve the above metrics:",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "One of the most impactful lessons that informed and inspired Project SPIN was GLSEN’s (Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network) research on LGBTQ bullying in public schools by California Safe Schools Coalition on understanding the differences between schools in overall LGBT safety. They released a study that indicated increased visible representation and allies led to a drastic decrease of both violence and harassment of LGBTQ youth in public schools. They also found a correlation between school safety and student well-being and academic achievement. As described by Author Russell, S. T., McGuire, J. K., & Laub, C. (2009), “Data are from the California Safe Schools Coalition School Climate Surveys, which were collected by students in seventeen public schools between 2003 and 2006, yielding over 6,000 surveys. The students who collected the data were typically GSA student leaders or members. The surveys were designed to study the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning high school students and their straight allies, and the steps schools can take to make schools safer. The surveys were developed and administered by the Gay-Straight Alliance Network.”",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "One of Project SPIN’s major challenges is responding to hesitance or lack of confidence from individual school administrators who are unsure of how to take a lead in creating safe schools for LGBTQ students. An example of this was the hesitance by some Elementary school administrations to not distribute the ally badges in their schools during last year’s launch, stating that “LGBTQ issues don’t really exist in elementary schools, only in middle and high schools” To remedy this situation, staff from SPIN are focusing their outreach on Elementary schools specifically (a 30% increase is our goal for the year), creating an Elementary School tool kit for staff and administration, and creating public service announcements with Elementary school children. Creating age-appropriate language will give administrators the necessary tools and support to have these dialogues in Elementary schools and teaching our students respect for all from starting in Elementary school. SPIN’s staff will be prepared to engage in an open dialogue with any LAUSD official willing to learn more about our work and goals.",

    "Does your project impact Los Angeles County?": "Yes (benefits a region of LA County)",

    "Please describe yourself.": "Collaboration (partners are signed up and ready to hit the ground running!)",
    "In one sentence, please describe your idea or project.": "LA Riverworks wants to engage LA communities in River revitalization.",
    "What will you do to implement this idea/project?": "Too often, community voices are left out of major decisions affecting the build out of our neighborhoods. Unless local residents are actively engaged and equipped with the tools to shape investments and large scale development projects, any resulting benefits and opportunities will not automatically reach current low-income residents.",
    "How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CONNECT today? In 2050?": "In 2050, a revitalized LA River will serve as a main artery through the city, connecting many diverse and dynamic neighborhoods across the region. A greener and cleaner LA River will also strengthen a collective connection to our environment, providing all Angelenos with access to a precious source of recreation. To achieve this vision, jobs will be created and River-adjacent communities will see new investment. Our project is focused on helping existing residents connect with this process so they too can access the health and economic opportunities that the River promises.",
    "Whom will your project benefit?": "Our project will benefit a diverse group of youth, families, seniors, small businesses, and other stakeholders who live, work, and play in the neighborhoods along the LA River. Many of these individuals are from predominantly Asian and Latino communities like Chinatown and Lincoln Heights, where low-income and working class families—the vast majority of whom speak a language other than English at home—work and shop at local small businesses; and Elysian Valley and Cypress Park, where long-time residents have cultivated a strong neighborhood identity with thriving commercial and creative spaces. These are neighborhoods that have made much from little; historically disinvested or underserved communities that have persevered while investment and opportunities repeatedly went elsewhere.",
    "Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.": "Our project will impact the above metrics through the following:",
    "What is your idea/project in more detail?": "A new project to revitalize the LA River promises to deliver 18,000 jobs, billions in private development, and tremendous environmental benefits. But a fundamental question remains: who will access these benefits?",
    "Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.": "SEACA and Public Counsel have agreed to collaborate on this project and have worked together to connect and mobilize diverse communities and create a more sustainable LA for the last five years. Through our partnership, communities have been able to come together to identify solutions to key needs such as jobs and affordable housing. SEACA trains hundreds of youth to become leaders in their communities in order to educate and mobilize seniors, working adults, and youth in five different languages. SEACA’s members include individuals residing in several River-adjacent neighborhoods. Public Counsel provides the land use knowledge to turn community priorities and goals into policy proposals that can be eventually adopted into law.",
    "What two lessons have informed your solution or project?": "We believe strongly that investment decisions may not realize their intended goals (and may have unintended consequences) unless the communities most impacted by those decisions are involved in the decision making. Some impacts (like displacement of small businesses and residents) cannot be rectified after they have occurred. This is why, at the state and local levels, we have focused on bringing these perspectives into policy discussions at the front end of the decision making process. In our experience, the most successful policies and investments are the ones that meaningfully engage affected residents BEFORE major decisions are made. Examples of these types of campaigns include our work at the Cornfields Arroyo to help develop an equity-focused plan, and the work that the Alliance for Community Transit is doing to help establish an equitable transit policy citywide.",
    "Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.": "SEACA and Public Counsel are confident that we will be able to implement our project in the next twelve months. We have already begun to determine a scope of work for our community assessment and are in discussions with research firms about this scope of work. We have also begun to engage decisionmakers, economic development legal and policy experts, and other stakeholders. Finally, both our organizations have experience in land use planning, local policy advocacy, and community benefits campaigns. This experience will help us quickly identify appropriate policy and organizing strategies to achieve our goals. Of course, achieving the outcome of connecting residents to economic opportunity may depend on the timing of the political process, but the legwork we will do in engaging communities and connecting them to the process will be implemented in the next 12 months.",
    "How will your project impact the LA2050 CONNECT metrics?": "Median travel time to work",
    "Please explain how you will evaluate your project.": "The project will utilize a mixed methods approach to measuring progress and impact. Outreach logs, sign-in sheets, and attendance records will track attendance and outreach to community members. We will also engage in an evaluation process with community members utilizing self-reported data collected at key intervals. This process will include individual surveys, group evaluations, and tracking progress towards meeting campaign goals.",
    "Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?": "Two major challenges we anticipate and our strategies for overcoming them are as follows:"
