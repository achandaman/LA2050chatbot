    "organization": "Voices Beyond Assault",
    "summary": "Voices Beyond Assault seeks to provide a SAFE, healing and uplifting enviroment for survivors of any form of sexual violence. Post trauma aid, resources and therapy are essential in healing and thriving after sexual trauma; a SAFE House of advocates, therapy and tranquility, this will amplify the well being of survivors post traumatic needs. Through our three pronged approach of education, advocacy and resource delivery, we aim to provide a SAFE place for survivors to become the newfound leaders in our world’s fight against sexual violence.",
    "goal": "LIVE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "This would be a novel survivor-centered empowerment project, with the core objective of being able to provide emergency trauma relief for survivors in the city of Los Angeles. Because of the effects of sexual trauma which have neurobiological impacts on the brain and nervous system causing PTSD, drug use, anxiety, and even suicide. The need for rehabilitation is required. In sum, this would be a home facility located within Los Angeles County where survivors could visit for a period of time to receive aid, resources, rest, rejuvenate, and heal following an incident(s) of sexual trauma, or moment of ‘triggers’ by their surroundings. Specifically, this house would have an array of on-site facilities available to our survivors; such as a (1) writing room, (2) meditation centre, (3) a quiet room, (5) optional therapy services, (6) yoga studio, and (7) temporary residency. Through this project, VBA would be able to immediately act and provide survivors of sexual violence with advocates, therapists, self care options and a space to heal and more importantly be SAFE. This program is unique, as there are an array of survivor shelters within the LA district [focused on re-housing and long term sheltering] but not focusing on direct healing and rejuvenation that survivors so readily need. Our Survivor SAFE House is imagined with the aim of providing an immediate life line to any survivor in need of post-trauma aid.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Pilot or new project, program, or initiative",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "VBA plans to define and measure the success of the Survivor Safe House project through metrics such as: (1) amount of survivors serverd [per annum], (2) daily/weekly capacity rates, (3) number of lodging/retreat days offered, (4) amount of therapy sessions completed [per annum], (5) amount of victim advocates requested on site, (6) amount of referrals offered to survivors [to more long-term emergency accommodation]. This information will all be collected, stored and published through our annual reports. The true success with having our SAFE House is the rehabilitation and lives that will be changed within our community and truly changing the face of survival and making our city of Los Angeles a healthier and happier place for survivors to thrive.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Sexual violence impacts survivors in all areas of their lives which includes their housing. More than 90% of rape and sexual assault victims know their attacker, because of this there are many safety concerns and trauma ‘triggers’ in their daily lives. A SAFE space where advocates, therapists and innovative therapy options are readily available is crucial to every survivors healing journey. While sexual assault post trauma organizations connect survivors with the services they need immediately following a sexual assault, needs related to a SAFE enviroment may be unaddressed and this is where our SAFE House is valuable. According to the NSVRC, “Safe and affordable housing is a necessary foundation to lead a healthy and productive life. Housing and sexual violence can have a reciprocal relationship.” Sexual violence has soared radically in the current COVID-19 pandemic, and thus, should be of primary concern in today’s world. The needs of survivors should be addressed accordingly.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The number of rapes reported in Los Angeles, CA was 62.73 per 100,000 population, a 2.38% increase from 2017. This is staggering. Some of the immediate and life long effects of sexual trauma are: self harm, substance abuse, panic attacks, PTSD, sleeping disorders, and suicide. By creating a SAFE atmosphere for survivors that is secure, efficient in support systems, therapists, advocates, post traumatic resources and assistance needed for rehabilitation will alleviate the many issues that do not allow survivors to live their best lives in society. VBA’s SAFE House will assist in survivors being productive citizens within our Los Angeles community. Our SAFE House will create a SAFE and healthy community of surviviors of sexual violence. With better immediate post-trauma services and a SAFE environment, survivors in Los Angeles can better serve the community and other survivors within Los Angeles County. There will be a new face of survival and a healing paradigm created!",

    "summary": "The Beautify LA Community Grant Program is an annual competitive matching grant open to the residents of Los Angeles to fund exceptional neighborhood projects. It encourages, supports, and provides opportunities to communities of high need and the general public in the ownership and beautification of public spaces. The grant will provide a stronger foundation and diverse partnerships that will revitalize the community and educate future generations to continue stewardship of public spaces through volunteerism.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "LA2050 will help us amplify the grant program and expand the limited number of awards. OCB/KLAB will execute a request for proposals throughout the City in English/Spanish from community groups, nonprofits, school groups, etc. Groups will submit project proposals of desired areas they would like to improve. Murals, art projects, medians and other creative projects in public spaces will take priority. Grant funds serve as seed money for community projects. The program will foster collaboration and create support networks, encourage creativity and innovation, instill community pride among residents, and empower them to take ownership of their communities. Grantees will work with city staff navigating partnerships and any city permit process that the project will require. An increase in community beautification projects creates a decrease in urban blight and crime related activity. To ensure equity, proposals will be screened and receive bonus points using CalEnviroscreen’s data on Disadvantaged communities (SB535 & AB 1550). A minimum of 33% of the proposals will be from communities of high need. This includes areas with high concentrations of people with low-income, high unemployment, low levels of home ownership, high rent burden, low levels of educational attainment, and high environmental pollution impact. The projects improve a neighborhood’s public safety and health through beautification while creating a positive economic impact and advocating for environmental justice.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "City of Los Angeles",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "With a growing population, increase in service demand, and the financial crisis from the Pandemic, LA does not have the financial capability nor the labor force for the services desired by its residents. We are aware that neighborhoods without equal access or knowledge of funding sources suffer a greater risk of blight. Urban blight creates a perceived acceptance of litter and graffiti. This in turn creates a sense of reduced public safety in impoverished areas. With a noted disparity in access to funding and scarce City resources to service over 99 neighborhoods, the community has expressed a sense of slow government responsiveness. In addition, city policy and procedures can be confusing to navigate. Community projects established without the basic requirements and permits lack the justification for longevity or sustainability in the public right of way and can be unintentionally destroyed or removed. This further creates a sense of disassociation of a responsive local government.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA County will enjoy an increase of beautiful open spaces and cleaner neighborhoods. Residents will see an increase in community and local government engagement through volunteerism, improved and maintained public spaces and increased knowledge of city resources by its residents. The projected impact of the Grant through a variety of clean, green, and sustainable projects will improve public safety and help prevent blight that will then reduce litter throughout LA. The grant methodology supports the Sustainable City plan and the Green New Deal. To receive funding means to follow best practices in empowering those who live, work, and play in the City with an equal opportunity to participate in bettering their neighborhoods. LA City can serve as an example of community partnerships beyond city services. A long term goal and byproduct of the grant program would be to develop a guide of helpful resources for project implementation (recognized organizations, sources of donations, etc).",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Despite the elimination of previously funded grant programs, years later stakeholders have continued to demonstrate a desire for creative community-based project opportunities. An average of 110 grants were awarded yearly, with a dollar value from $2,500 -$10,000. An organization’s contribution match is usually more than the award. Examples • The Big Blue M: Awarded $10,000.Match= $21,575 • Veteran Memorial Park: Awarded $10,000.Match= $26,629 • Moorpark Way Median: Awarded $10,000.Match= $55,063 The value beyond funding is in the variety of community partnerships and the social/environmental impact. A knowledgeable community knows how to request services and advocate for their needs. We have seen an increase in communication and service needs, documented through the MyLA311 system. Knowledge of resources increases volunteerism. This increase in participation is documented in the number of annual volunteer hours entered while beautifying communities through clean up events/projects.",

At BGCV, our hands-on Music Production curriculum prepares students for future employment in the music industry. In addition to taking individual and group music lessons, music production members learn to operate a recording facility, use ProTools, Logic Pro X, and Ableton Live, work with actual clients, learn the science behind sound, partake in music industry workshops, and learn about higher education. Music Production students may book the studio for private sessions. Members also attend field trips to various record label offices and state of the art recording studios. Many high school music producers, musicians and songwriters are on their way to achieving success, thanks to the guidance provided. Based on our track record of success at BGCV, we are now working toward expanding our curriculum to South and Central Los Angeles with BGCMLA.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "BGCMLA will recruit participants, provide space for programming, and manage the hiring process for the BGCMLA Music Director to be hired.

(All programs will adhere to public health and County guidelines, and both organizations have implemented stringent COVID safety protocols. We anticipate serving near normal numbers on-site by Fall 2021, but we are planning for multiple scenarios, including hybrid onsite/online programming.) BGCV has a nationally recognized performing arts program. BGCV provides our members with opportunities to creatively express themselves and build their skills in state-of-the-art music production studios that they would not otherwise be able to access. We emphasize building skills and learning, rather than perfect performance or artwork. As members work on their music or dance skills, they learn discipline and perseverance, and have the opportunity to perform or showcase their art. Our state-of-the-art music center and studio offers Club members the opportunity to learn skills in audio engineering, music production, song writing, and vocals, as well as learn about elements of the music and performing arts industry. We also provide introductory piano, violin, ukulele, guitar, and drums/percussion group and individual lessons, and ballet classes.

We have set outcomes that 90% of members will improve their music skills by the end of the fiscal year. The Music Directors evaluate student work by assessing their skill level at the beginning and end of each semester and noting improvement. As students improve, they create more complex music or art projects. We also use our recitals as program evaluations. We also focus on ensuring those members with an interest in a career in the arts have the skills to do so, with a long-term goal of increasing the percentage of underrepresented groups in creative industries.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Both BGCV and BGCMLA serve diverse, predominantly low-income students ages 6 to 18 without the financial resources to access dance and music education. Prior to COVID-19, we offered robust dance and music classes like ukulele, ballet, violin and more to all Club members. During the COVID-19 shutdown, access to creative outlets for our children and teens was essentially shut off. Music education and performance is the perfect way for children and teens to express their emotions, especially when they can’t articulate their feelings. Our young peoples’ mental health has suffered greatly from isolation and stress during the pandemic, and we want to relaunch our music and dance program. In addition, until recently, BGCMLA has had limited music programing. During 2020, they partnered with Fender Play Foundation and USC’s Thornton School of Music to offer music programs. Due to the enthusiastic response, they want to build an ongoing music program at BGCMLA Clubhouses, based on our model.",

The death of a loved one is traumatic, but experiencing a family member murdered results in debilitating and lasting trauma and grief significantly unique to families of homicide victims. The circumstances surrounding a murder and the sudden loss to murder create a complexity of traumas that disrupt the grieving process for family members. While homicides occur across socio-economic groupings, murders are disproportionately higher in low and middle-income brackets. Many families of murdered victims find coping and healing in building relationships and community with other co-victims who share the same experience. In addition to these communities of families' search for legal and medical resources to assist with their recovery, they also need to feel like husbands, wives, daughters, sons, and families and the joyful parts of living again through affordable, safe, supportive experiences.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Sail Away Weekends Program invites families of murdered victims at no cost to experience the life-affirming healing properties of shared excitement, laughter, physical activity, problem-solving, teamwork, creativity, appreciation, reflection, and imagination that exist on a weekend expedition to Catalina Island. The following program meets the LA County COVID-19 guidelines at this time and is flexible to adjust as restrictions are tightened or eased. Five to six families (20 individuals total) will undergo a health screening and, if no indications of infection, will join the LAMI tall ships on a Saturday morning in San Pedro, CA. The ship has been zoned for safely-distanced activities, and households will move from between zones. Rigorous hygiene and PPE protocols are enforced. Participants will learn and perform all sailing and live-aboard responsibilities, including sail handling, navigation, meal-preparations, and ship-shape upkeep. The ship will arrive at Catalina Island early Saturday afternoon. The time at Catalina will include and inspire opportunities to climb the rigging, swim, snorkel, kayak, island hikes, play maritime team-building games, participate in storytelling, and downtime. Participants will sleep at comfortable island-based facilities LAMI regularly utilizes. If guidelines allow it, participants will sleep aboard the ship.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Our helping homeless, seniors and under served communities has a direct impact on our shelter system intake and euthanasia and on that same population caring for themselves. For the elderly, they will often neglect their own care to provide for their pets. For homeless, many will not seek out assistance because it might require giving up their pets. Our program provides wellness for their pets but we have also teamed with Adult Protective Services to care for animals that then allows those people to seek out care they need. By keeping the animals healthy, we prevent owner surrender to our already overcrowded and under funded shelters. This takes the burden off of their having to find rescues to take in and pay for care, or for the agency to get care just to get that animal re-adopted. We have collaborated with numerous organizations to provide resources for food, litter, medicine and other necessities that allow the humans to have funds towards their own well being.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "• Of the dogs entering shelters, approximately 48% are adopted and 20% are euthanized • Of the cats entering shelters, approximately 50% are adopted and 27% are euthanized Returning a pet to a rescue or surrendering to a shelter can be devastating to the animal physically and emotionally. Many shut down, stop eating, become combative, and by not engaging people lose the opportunity to be adopted once there. Working together as a humane community we can reduce one aspect of the reason shelters have to kill for space. Your funds will fix health issues that are perfectly treatable and help drive down the euthanasia rates. By our providing surgery and hospitalization to medically needy animals at low to no cost to the owners , we estimate that in our area of Los Angeles County we can save more lives It will keep beloved pets with their owners where they are loved and wanted and that companionship has a positive impact on our population.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Prevention of surrender has a direct impact to the shelter euthanasia numbers. Taking care of animals for pet owners before they make that decision keep them with their families and removes the care impact from rescues that would then shoulder that financial burden to save the life. On average the cost is $70 per pet to keep them with their owner. The Covid-19 pandemic crisis has put significant strain on people’s finances and LAP Help has been providing financial aid to pet owners who may have fallen on hard times. We are handling this need both in providing payments for care directly to providers or in our own clinic, as we are doing monthly outreach events with a team of organizations who have partnered with us for mobile clinics to give care and prevent surrender. The medical intervention and care being given ranges from dental work and surgery to spay / neuter and vaccination. Our goal is do do more outreach in communities that are not getting these resources and it is beneficial to both the population and the city. For people who have pets as companionship or to protect them in challenging areas, they might not have the funds to properly care for those pets. They get ill and then they surrender them. They love them, but economics forces them to make decisions they don't want to make. Helping when problems are small prevent them from becoming huge. Our goal is to be a zero kill city, often the shelters take in animals in such bad shape they have no choice.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Patient is evaluated for medical need (dental, wound care, surgery), cost of care / surgery is estimated. Client completes a financial need form as to ability to pay and must consent to take the animal back rather than be surrendered to a rescue or shelter. We are also working with other area vets to provide supportive funds and care to owners who want to keep their animals. All statistics are kept on what care was given and approximate cost. Many organizations are offering low cost or free spay neuter, but presently only two organizations are offering other services. This leaves a very wide gap in the community. We measure our success by the number of animals we treat each year with advanced surgery and/or care that the rescue organization or pet owner cannot afford to provide. The result is the animals should be remaining with their owners once care is administered, versus being surrendered to a rescue or shelter."

Workforce development (WD) case managers assess clients’ current work history and job skills, literacy, English and Math proficiency, and computer skills. Based on this assessment, the case manager and participant work together to design short and long-term objectives and prioritize service needs. The WD Program has four core areas of emphasis. These four areas are offered within an overarching framework of life and workforce skills, training, and support: 1) Jenesse provides Vocational Training to survivors of DV to prepare them to enter the workforce in a variety of positions. Jenesse created an online vocational assessment that allows clients to receive expedited employment services. 2) Jenesse has provided an Entrepreneurship program to support women who have an interest in starting their own business and pursuing self-employment. 3) Social Enterprise: Jenesse will underwrite the operating expenses for a retail boutique (online and – when possible – a physical location) where items created by survivors can be showcased and sold. 4) The Employment Readiness program facilitates career exploration and assists in employment placement in career sectors that are predicted to experience significant growth in the coming years such as education, health, and medicine.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Empowering and educating DV survivors on how to live a life free of violence not only impacts those victims and their loved ones but can have profound and positive reverberations on how communities and economies operate. Research estimates the economic cost of intimate partner violence at nearly 3.6 trillion at a population level. Achieving economic equality for survivors not only leaves them less vulnerable to violence from an intimate partner, but the financial stability also improves their lives and that of their immediate family. This in turn provides a significant overall economic boost for the community. Economic equity – defined here, as the way that income and opportunities are distributed – and empowerment are also vital to a violence-free existence. It must be an integral component to the healing process and foremost in our support strategy. Also, this program supports minority- and women-owned businesses by offering counseling, start-up funds, and other support services.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Most of Jenesse’s clients live below the federal poverty level and arrive at a Jenesse shelter with one or more children—who are the most affected victims of domestic violence (DV). Ninety percent of the women in Jenesse's DV programs are unemployed upon entrance and 60% have not completed high school. Yet these women must raise their children on their own after leaving their batterers. They must maintain stable housing in a city where the median home price is $650,000 — twice the national cost — and rents are more than 40% higher than the national average. Lack of employment and employable skills exacerbates the cycle of DV by limiting viable options for self-sufficiency. Furthermore, during the pandemic, individuals of color with lower educational attainment, are more likely to have been laid off or furloughed as businesses have shuttered or to have jobs that are considered higher risk in terms of the coronavirus.",

Onboarding for teens focuses on soft skills and communication. We learn about the power of empathy and active listening, and practice by role playing. With seniors, we’ve found that technology training is important. We practice how to use different platforms, like Zoom and test accessories, like headphones. We require everyone to attend at least one onboarding session and give the option for additional 1 on 1 help if needed. Week 1 is a group session used to introduce all participants to each other. Week 2 we pick a topic like tech support and teens lead the discussion in 1 on 1 breakouts to assist seniors. Week 3 we do a group activity like online trivia. Week 4 and 5 the teens and seniors trade off leading breakout room discussions to learn more about each other and talk about common interests. The final week seniors provide “Golden Nuggets,” advice they wish their younger selves would have known. With our virtual programs we immediately address the isolation challenges with seniors by providing supportive social services.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Living with extended family is common for seniors around the world. But in the U.S., seniors are more likely to age in place. About 28% of seniors live alone, and the percentage increases with age (44% of women 75 or older live alone). Seniors face problems like depression and isolation. Even in homecare facilities, seniors are not able to fully benefit from social and emotional support; this has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Additionally, teens are struggling to learn soft skills needed to be successful outside a school setting. They also struggle to earn the required community service hours needed to graduate. Since 2005 LA County has required students earn a minimum number of service hours to graduate. Building soft skills and community service go hand in hand as they promote leadership, self-awareness, confidence and compassion. If this problem is not addressed, the number of seniors facing isolation and depression could increase, and high school graduation rates could suffer."

Over the course of the program, our students learn about the many elements that go into creating a film. Students work together to decide on an issue they want to focus on, and develop the idea for their film. Once the idea has been chosen, students collaborate with a professional screenwriter and producer to create a first draft of a script. They then attend hands-on workshops, visit major film and television sets, and meet with A-list guest speakers. It culminates with the production of their own short film. When Covid struck Reel Start was able to pivot to a virtual classroom and animation production the Los Angeles program encountered a major technology gap.

There are a multitude of causes for the issue but the Reel Start focuses on three main barriers. 1. Introduction of Opportunity: Unless you come from an industry background it's difficult to comprehend the vast number of careers available in the entertainment industry. 2.

UniCamp recruits a leadership team of 40 students who, in turn, recruits an additional 350-400 students. Volunteers train based on the American Camp Association standards and create innovative programs in preparation for summer camp. The volunteers also attend a series of team- and community-building events that include retreats, workshops, and on-site orientation. This year, we have created a comprehensive operational guide adhering to CDC guidance and requirements set forth by state and local health authorities to open camp for volunteers and campers. We expect most, if not all, volunteers will be vaccinated. With an 87-year track record, our approach is highly effective because UniCamp is more than a one-off volunteering event.

The young people we work with are bright, hard working and attend top colleges but they lack family resources, and extended networks to fully engage in meaningful career exploration. There are knowledge gaps based on career options, fields, how to create a professional resume, how to prepare for interviews and how to network. These knowledge gaps can limit our students’ opportunities for economic mobility and growth. Our students have received an excellent education but cannot share their experiences, perspective and ideas with employers. Los Angeles needs diverse talent to lead projects and initiatives that will improve our city and beyond. We need to prepare our future leaders who need extra support and resources to thrive.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The original goal of College Match is to change the lives of thousands of exceptional low-income young adults, their families and communities in Los Angeles. Our students come from communities with high poverty, little social mobility and limited access to professional networks which are additional barriers to finding gainful employment and internship opportunities. Project Match will help our students find employment that offers them career growth, fair pay and benefits. If we are successful in this endeavor, our students will have more financial security and secure generational upward mobility. Project Match will prepare the future leaders of Los Angeles and ensure that employers, companies and organizations have diverse talent that reflect the city of Los Angeles. When they become professionals in their fields, they will be role models for other low-income young people of color and uplift their communities",

The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans cites other barriers including a shortage of affordable housing and lack of access to health care and social support networks. Further, military occupations and training are not always transferable to the civilian workforce, making some Veterans less competitive in the job market. There are 3,902 homeless Veterans living in LA County (LAHSA 2020).

(Solomon, M. “How to help young adults with autism transition to adulthood” 7 Aug. 2018) Muralism addresses this lack of inclusion by employing these individuals to paint public art. Our artists gain work experience, social skills, confidence and competence. Kevin Titcher, has worked for 18-months, ”I enjoy the creativity and I’m learning something new every day, not just with art but with tools and new techniques.” By involving community volunteers to help paint, our artists engage with a range of personalities.

As of April 2021, our team and community volunteers finished 17 projects, including 30 individual utility box murals across Valley Village. A 100K grant will fund operating costs to complete 10 large-scale wall murals. In collaboration with business owners, neighborhood councils, and city council staff, Muralism will identify public facing walls that will be impactful when painted. Our artists design the mural, prep and prime the wall, outline and color code the image in a paint-by-number fashion. We recruit volunteers to paint alongside our crew. During the COVID pandemic, we transitioned to focus our efforts on small-scale utility box murals that allow for social distancing. We provide PPE including masks, gloves, aprons and sanitizer. Volunteers are assigned specific time slots. Our work readiness classes are offered via Zoom. This has limited the in-person social contact that is so vital to our ASD employees. However, we have been able to grow the number of participants in our online work readiness forum. When business leaders see the work our artists do and volunteers work alongside our team, there is a shift in perception that those with special needs can contribute in impactful ways to our city.

Under mounting political pressure, the dominant solution has been to target narrow quantitative metrics by providing as many units of housing as quickly and inexpensively as possible. Embodied in the provision of this housing are cultural values that are often incongruous with the lifestyle, demographics, and needs of the population being housed. To receive assistance, potential residents must conform or they do not qualify. Housing provided is typically individual units with parking and little collective space, unavailable to undocumented individuals or families, and with little ability to reduce the cost of housing for the end-user without public assistance throughout their tenancy. Additionally, a metrics-driven housing practice spatially distributes supportive housing far from employment opportunities and other necessary amenities, compounding the deleterious effects of housing insecurity.",

These elements are required to stabilize female-headed households whose instability has only increased as a result of the pandemic. The Village concept aspires to consider each resident as a vital node in the broader community, whose health and welfare is determined by the strength of bonds between members.

We will regularly share these with community stakeholders and industry leaders for their feedback, but consider the community response to be our most valuable metric of success. We will develop a “Social Impact Bond” to address the current inability of funding models to reflect and quantify the long-term financial impact of innovative housing schemes.

The Village is a shared, integrated, affordable housing concept accommodating multiple families in rental housing, and will be oriented towards female-led households to protect victims of domestic violence and to address the soaring number of women and their families experiencing increased instability as a result of the pandemic. In contrast to the majority of supportive housing that is provided as atomized, individual units, encouraging atomized, isolated patterns of use, The Village will be oriented around The Village commons, communal spaces that facilitate the sharing of domestic labor such as childcare and cooking. It will explore the potential of supportive housing to strengthen communities and bolster essential networks of support, while providing onsite job opportunities through these networks. It will also incorporate a diversity of additional programs, such as spaces for economic development or healthcare to mitigate challenges brought about by the geographic sprawl of LA County.

They will produce written and visual analyses for the research and outreach components, and lead the design process to create a new housing strategy prototype. Together with NEW and CCF, they will organize workshops, design charrettes, and community outreach events. NEW and CCF will contribute feedback and direction to the proposals, leverage their extensive experience in community development, and identify potential project sites. We have readied ourselves to work together as a team, and by integrating design-thinking from the earliest stage of project conceptualization, our interdisciplinary approach gives us a unique understanding of how to create a better way to house unstable families.",

Non-Profit Impact: We currently have regular client satisfaction surveys where our clients indicate the impact that our work has had on the operations of their organizations, and actively track the number of clients, projects, and volunteer hours provided by our organization. These include: - 99 nonprofit clients served (30% of clients are repeating client) - 141 completed projects - 46,000+ volunteer hours donated 2. Volunteer Up-skilling & Professional Development Impact: Using onboarding and offboarding surveys, we are able to determine the positive impact our program has on core STEM skills by comparing the volunteer skills assessment before and after our program. These include: - 95% of volunteers report an increase in their technical and professional abilities",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Prior success from our Pro-Bono Consulting Program is two-pronged: we help create a Los Angeles where non-profits are able to do more and positively impact a wide variety of members in the community, while increasing the social-mobility of minority groups through valuable job experience and hands-on training. Our Pro-Bono Consulting Program results in a more efficient non-profit community. This leads to increased awareness around existing non-profit programs, more people benefiting from those programs, and a greater impact on global climate change. Seed also promotes a more civically engaged community by creating bonding experiences between professionals and the broader field of social and sustainable impact. Program success creates a Los Angeles where more people are actively volunteering, unemployed and underemployed people learn skills to help them reenter the workforce, and under-represented communities increase social mobility through our professional development services.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "LA based non-profits are underfunded and often lack the expertise they need to tackle their most pressing issues. While they make due with what they have, they are unable to optimize their organization to expand their service capacity and maximize their impact with the donations that they receive. Consulting organizations that traditionally would provide the expertise and guidance to overcome these hurdles are extremely expensive, and paying for these services is outside the budgets of local non-profit organizations. Unable to pay for such expertise, these issues and inefficiencies go unresolved and our local non-profit organizations are held back from achieving their full potential and making their biggest impact in the Los Angeles area. Seed Consulting Group strives to bridge the gap of these issues through providing a team of pro-bono consultants that recommend sustainable solutions to each organization's most pressing issues.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Seed Consulting Group fills the professional services gap for Los Angeles Non-Profits by reimagining what it means to volunteer. By creating unique, high-impact volunteer opportunities, we engage portions of the population that previously may not have considered volunteering, including the unemployed or underemployed, graduate students, and individuals working in demanding professions, increasing civic engagement and long term social impact. We engage these segments by creating project teams that provide free consulting work to help solve LA county non-profit organizations's biggest problems, allowing these non-profits to amplify their impact with their existing resources. Our Pro-Bono Consulting Cycle is a 10-week program that connects volunteer consultants with non-profits. We provide professional development for our volunteers by training them with consulting basics, enable them to use their individual strengths and expertise as part of a project team. In the process, they learn valuable STEM skills, gain relevant work experience, and provide networking opportunities which increases their potential for social mobility. While upskilling members of our community, they build long-term relationships with local non-profits. We perform meaningful work for our community's non-profits, amplifying their existing impact in a variety of ways, such as increasing effectiveness of their programs, increasing their revenue streams, increasing community awareness of their work."

The free app is available to download on iOS and Android devices to teen users 13-19 years old who can post 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Posts range from a bad breakup or first panic attack, to self-harm, suicidal ideation, and child abuse or sexual assault. Posts can only be responded to by our trained volunteer Teen Advisors, who are supervised during app hours (nightly 5-10 pm PST) by licensed mental health professionals. Prior to signing up for shifts throughout the month, Teen Advisors undergo a 50-hour training on empathetic reflective communication, values and bias, and mental health basics. Teen Talk’s “It’s OK to not be OK” campaign will increase our digital marketing and outreach to teens across digital platforms they already use, including Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. The marketing campaign will focus on reducing mental health stigma while driving users to the app as a low barrier, anonymous and safe mental wellness support.

At Teen Talk App we envision an LA County where all young people have those safe spaces in their families, schools, communities and on their phones. The positive peer support users experience on the Teen Talk App fosters a safe landing place for a young person's deepest fears and worst days. By experiencing unconditional positive feedback and empathy in response to the thing they are afraid to tell anyone, teens feel more confident to reach out to those around them. LA County needs spaces for teens that feel they have nowhere else to turn, Teen Talk will be that space.",

To evaluate Teen Advisor effectiveness, we analyze the impact of Teen Talk Training on Teen Advisors. Current results demonstrate significant increases in knowledge of mental health concerns, and how to support someone in crisis, increased awareness of privilege and increases in cultural humility. To evaluate our end user experience, we analyze return user activity and satisfaction ratings from teens who have received support (thumbs up, thumbs down), with a current positive rating of over 88%. Return user activity enables us to understand trends in the types of support teens are interested in, and the types of responses they are most likely to engage in. Ongoing evaluation positions us to provide an environment where teens can thrive and feel safe."

These four regions have strong Teen representation at the park and rec departments served by Surf Bus Foundation. The initiative kicks off with an immersive camping trip in San Onofre--the most special surf spot in all of Southern California and a welcoming place for beginners. Out-of-class nature experiences make a lasting difference for youth and we want to set the tone with this “peak experience” before the common stressors of a new school year commence. The teams of student athletes will receive direct support from Surf Academy coaches and Samohi peer-to-peer surf team members. Each team of 12 students will have a unique weekly schedule of combined fitness requirements, monthly community surf sessions hosted by Surf Academy and Surf Bus Foundation, and a monthly weekend stay at The Shore Hotel in Santa Monica for immersive surf contest training. Finally, our athletes will represent themselves, their team, their school, and community in 6 surf contests over the school year. These events are regularly scheduled “peak experiences” meant to help a student hone their craft and provide a low-stakes way to measure their surf progress.",

Success looks like our teenage surfers helping to transform what contest surfing looks like; to transform what the community at large thinks of when asked, “what does a surfer look like?” Our Surf Bus high school student-athletes could be the start of a surf/ocean love legacy for their families and communities that spans generations. Ten years of surf team cultivation by Surf Academy has resulted in an across team retention rate that burgeoned from 30% in 2010, to 85% in 2020, with half of these students being first generation surf Angelenos. We have watched, year after year, as one ocean/surf curious child inspires their siblings to start surfing, parents to take lessons, grandparents to come watch surf practices, and extended families gather at the beach for the excitement of contests (and even participate).",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "We want to diversify the contest line up by creating a more equitable and supportive surf environment for young surfers of color. Generations of potential surfers are missing from Southern California's ocean wave line-ups because of the legacy of segregation in LA between communities of color and the coast. The result is a sport known for its homogeneity rather than one representative of the variety and diversity of the the ocean. We posit that creating and sustaining four inner city high school surf teams, with an emphasis on training for contests, will help young Angelenos feel a unique sort of freedom, success, and adaptable control over their environment that only the ocean can facilitate.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Success will be measured two ways: personal skills development/attendance (of the individual) and the high school surf team performance over all. We use beginner, intermediate, and advanced skill cards to measure progress in 4 areas: ocean safety, swim skills, surf skills, and fitness. The season begins with an ocean assessment that tests athletes in these areas so coaching staff know how to focus workouts for the individual within a larger practice. Skills tests are repeated every six weeks. Surf contest participation and final placing is a second metic. Each competitor represents themselves and their team in heats. Surfers must strategize together to create the best heat outcome for the team, and still work to maximize their own growth/meet their goals. Integration of personal and group success is learned by positively utilizing potential failure. An individual with stand out performances may not be from the team that collectively finishes the best across a surf team season.",

Often, BIPOC histories and stories are not dissected in public school and youth are not taught much of their racial and/or ethnic history in a nuanced way. Color Compton aims to address this directly by being a physical creative space for youth and community members to learn the histories of BIPOC communities and Compton.

In “OurArchive.Me” we aim to expand this and be more intentional about the creating and preserving aspect of visual art. This project will work in a series of residencies of groups of up to 10-15 youth members at a time. Each individual will receive a stipend for their participation and will work collaboratively to develop a communal archive catalogue. Youth will engage in educational research on archival work and histories of BIPOC communities and will actively engage with their community. They will begin with their own familial archival excavation and look through family photo albums and videos to begin an individual catalogue. Then they will present to each other and digitize any photos from community members to build on a community archive.

To date, we have had positive feedback and critical reflective feedback on the impact of self-identity and level of confidence in creative fields. Moving forward, we hope to continue these measures of impact and expand on our surveys to include more areas and room for growth. In addition we hope to develop a mentorship component to the project and ensure that students are not only developing leadership skills but are able to develop networks."

At 24th St. Elem., our flagship garden, nearly 100 lbs. of compostable food a day was being discarded, which is 18,000 lbs. a year! Yet over 1.1M L.A. residents are also food insecure, with 410,000 children at risk of hunger. Understanding the connection between food waste and food insecurity, our program models how public schools can be sites of action. At 24th St. Elem., 93% of students qualify for Federal free/reduced lunch. The surrounding neighborhoods of West Adams/Jefferson Park are part of the County’s Service Planning Area 6, where 31% of residents live in poverty and 30% are food insecure. As one of the densest populated areas (pop. 1,030,078), South L.A. has only 46 grocery stores, far less than more affluent areas. While food access is improving in the area, new food outlets can be unaffordable or inaccessible for low-income residents.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "To act on these twin issues, Cafeteria to Compost operates within the most logical places to reach the greatest number of highest needs children: public schools. We start the school year by visiting every classroom with lessons on composting and what they can expect in the cafeteria. Then, every day at the lunch tables (pre-COVID), a paid team of parents and interns help students return and share unwanted food items during lunch, and again with families at pick-up time. From Sept. 2019-Feb. 2020, we composted or redistributed over 9,000 lbs. of cafeteria food, diverting food waste from the landfill to our school compost piles and significantly increasing local food access. Unique to our program is the paid team of school parents - jobs that also help foster parent engagement at school - and our Training Modules, Classroom Curriculum, and a detailed Operations Manual. In Fall 2021 we’ll continue building the operation at 24th St. and expand to a second GSF sister school, Grand View Blvd. in Mar Vista, where 65% of students qualify for Federal free or reduced lunch. While the food share component may still be temporarily curtained per Covid restrictions, collection and diversion to the compost will proceed. The program builds on years of GSF programming and deep engagement with both schools, cultivating school leaders, teachers, plant managers, parents, and cafeteria staff. Recognizing our decades of work with schools, LAUSD is crafting a permanent Service Agreement for GSF.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We measure the impact of our program by the: 1) amount of food waste diverted from the cafeteria to the compost piles; 2) amount of unused food that we recover from the cafeteria and redistribute to the school community, both at lunch and after school; 3) number of other GSF schools that have adopted the program; and 4) number of opportunities we have to share our results via presentations, tours, and meetings with District officials. From Sept. 2019-March 2020 (when schools closed), we had composted 5,325 lbs. of cafeteria food. Students dropped off 21,528 items at the Share Table, and picked up 10,898 items. We redistributed edible food and milk to school families after school at pick-up time (2,602 recipients), for a total of 3,753 lbs. of food, plus an additional 5,429 items of food/milk that were counted individually but not weighed.

As we expand to Grand View, we’ll debut our Training Modules and Operations Manual that detail everything from how to collaborate with school staff, to how to build compost piles and test finished soil. We’ll share collection metrics with cafeteria managers to help determine the amount and type of food they order for their schools (source reduction). Our long-term goals are: 1) have the program at all 7 GSF schools and then; 2) have the District create permanent Food Services Division staff positions to run Cafeteria to Compost programs on their own. With the average school throwing away 150-200 lbs. of food every day, imagine what food access and reduced landfills in LA County could look like if even 10% of LAUSD began a Cafeteria to Compost program!",

Bringing authors into classrooms opens the door to the arts and literature for kids. A grant of this size would enable the hiring of a new staff position fully devoted to WITS; the increase in workshops to 12 per year in 10 schools, reaching approximately 600 students annually; the purchase of additional textbooks; and increased instructing artist stipends (internationally renowned authors Doug Kearney and Chris Abani taught for WITS, and we continue to have high quality WITS instructors). The grant would also help implement WITS HQ with additional necessary equipment, increasing academic achievement as well as knowledge of career and life choice potentials, community issues, and civil rights. Youth will be provided a safe space to build self-esteem and mature intellectually and socially.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "WITS teachers, school teachers, and students are polled through pre- and post-workshop surveys. Student evaluations include quantifiable questions about confidence in writing and public speaking, understanding of vocabulary, and interest in poetry, in addition to short answers about teacher effectiveness, etc. Teacher surveys include short answer questions about student performance, the relationship between workshops and the curriculum, and the effectiveness of the WITS teacher to encourage CA State Educational Standards. Comments include: “descriptive language use has flourished, and is evident in their classroom writing,” “confidence in writing has soared,” and “thank you for opening the world of creative writing. They will never forget this experience.” Of students surveyed, 69% felt more comfortable in a classroom environment, 70% developed an interest in writing poetry, and 77% of students reported improvement in their writing ability after participating in WITS.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "WITS places published poets in classrooms to work with predominantly underserved students for one hour a week for six weeks. Students are exposed to poetry not offered in standard curricula, gain an understanding of different poetic forms, and express themselves by writing poetry of their own. Each student submits a polished poem, which is published in a professionally bound anthology, theirs to take home at no cost. Red Hen created WITS poetry textbooks, which students also keep. School teachers coordinate lesson plans with the WITS workshops to provide continuity throughout the semester. In this way, the WITS program is woven into students’ overall education and becomes more than an extracurricular activity. Students benefit by working with professional poets, being encouraged to express themselves while learning college-level English language skills, and experiencing the joy and sense of achievement that comes with having one’s work published. Red Hen Press is uniquely positioned to offer such a program, having a diverse range of poets eager to share their craft. WITS HQ will be an after-school program for high school students to visit Red Hen’s workshop space for a quiet and safe place to study, write, and explore the publishing industry. Participating youth will receive tutoring and engage in community service, field trips, and enrichment activities. WITS HQ will also host open mic nights and student book clubs (books provided at no cost)!",

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "WITS was founded in 2003 out of Red Hen Press Editor Dr. Kate Gale’s experience with parenting. A single mother of two kids, she was surprised to learn that there was practically no arts instruction in Title I schools, and high school graduation rates were at 72.5% (per LAUSD). Fortunately, her neighborhood's public school had a magnet arts program. When Gale realized the only thing anchoring her son in school was the theater class he loved, she determined that Red Hen had to make it part of its mission to get arts into Title I schools. After WITS’s first year, school teachers told Gale, “These kids have gotten a taste of achievement. They’ll never drop out now.” Says Gale, “Every child that gets excited because of that book they carry around with their own work printed in it, that’s success.” According to the CA Arts Education Data Project, in 2018, graduation rates were up to 81.8%. WITS will continue to inspire young minds until every LA child excels in and finishes school."

They are the most in-demand skills that a young person needs in order to be competitive for jobs – many of which have yet to be created. Yet, many young people – particularly Black and Latinx low-income youth – are not given the same playing field to engage with technology to be competitive in today’s educational and professional environments. The reality is that Blacks and Latinxs represent less than 18% of the tech industry nationwide. Further, they make up less than 10% of degrees conferred in Computer Science and IT annually. They are ultimately shut out of opportunities for economic advancement. AOT’s programs are structured to ensure that low-income young people of color have the ability to economically succeed and secure a future for themselves in spaces of innovation – whether they decide to enter the workforce or become technology entrepreneurs.",

Teachers participating in the TPD Program participate in two, week-long professional development training sessions in the fall (August) and spring (January) of each academic year. During these sessions, teachers learn the Web Development curriculum from AOT Program Managers and build out their own portfolio of curriculum-aligned projects that demonstrate mastery of topics including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and API’s. By the end of each week-long session, participating teachers develop their knowledge of computer science and coding and build their capacity to deliver AOT’s Web Development Curriculum to their own students in their own classrooms. In addition to these week-long sessions, teachers are provided ongoing training, teaching resources, and a network of AOT support to ensure successful implementation of the Web Development curriculum. Students who complete this program the curriculum gain a technical and professional skill set that allows them to tap into the innovation economy, gaining the confidence to pursue degrees and careers in technology.

By merging art and science, our learning tools are multidisciplinary STEAM experiences. We created an interactive game called Pancreatic Beta Cell Station, where patients and students take an avatar through a “metro line” experience in the Pancreatic Beta Cell. Understanding the systems of this cell is paramount for T2D patients to understand why adherence to their treatment regimens is essential. We work in conjunction with Nancy Chang, USC Faculty at The Keck School of Medicine, who is a researcher at the Type 2 Diabetes clinic at CHLA. This grant will support the completion of the game and Beta testing at the T2D diabetes clinic. Once completed, the game will be tested in a feasibility and acceptability clinical trial in Spring 2022. Our program developed learning modules and a VR experience that are ready to share with highschools. The grant will support taking our learning tools into a Sequoyah High School classroom in the fall to work with a dedicated group of students and faculty to test the curriculum and create effective learning modules for all high school students that are aligned with NGSS science standards. In the spring, the lesson plans, teacher guides, and classroom tools will be available for use in partner public high-school classrooms.",

Another illness impacting Los Angeles, where knowledge of biology is essential for its mitigation, prevention or possible cure is type 2 diabetes (T2D). There are many books and traditional classes that teach this content, but our program has created innovative learning tools using emergent technologies to teach youth because this generation of students and patients pay more attention to these platforms and therefore, have a long-term engagement with what happens to their body at the cellular level.",

We continued the initiatives (described below) by modifying them for virtual implementation, an approach we applied to all our work. * Summer Melt Intervention – During the summer before college, many recent high school graduates lack the guidance to navigate tuition and financial aid hurdles, among other enrollment requirements. As a result, a certain percentage of students who had committed to enroll never make it to their college. Through the Summer Melt Initiative, Partnership staff directly assist our at-risk graduates to successfully transition to enrollment. * Best-Fit Advising – We provide our high schools’ college counselors with tailored professional development to support students in applying to best-fit colleges. Such schools have high graduation rates for students of color and meet a high percentage of financial need. * College Access Partners – Our staff works with community partners to offer assistance with college applications, financial aid and enrollment. * On-Track-To-College Tool: We assist our high schools to inform families of their student’s personal progress in meeting objectives related to college completion; students develop goals in response to their progress.",

Our students—and the majority of LA Unified’s 500,000 students—desperately need a pathway toward greater economic mobility: 96% of our students qualify for Free or Reduced-Price Meals, often used as an indicator for families living in poverty; 89% of students identify as Latinx and 9% as African American, and, as such, encounter limitations fueled by systemic racism. Another problem exists beyond challenges within our schools and throughout LA Unified: many students and families believe that college is for other people. Typically, this belief does not stem from an aversion to a university education. Rather, students see college as something unattainable, a default position often influenced by a lack of exposure to educational opportunities, as well as severe financial constraints."

Consequently, food insecurity perpetuates poverty and harms our community’s health. COVID-19 has intensified barriers families face in obtaining fresh and healthy food. Many people have lost jobs or hours, leading to tighter meal budgets. Others have become caretakers for children or ill family members, reducing their time and energy for grocery shopping and cooking. Low-income Angelenos—especially those at greatest risk of poor health outcomes—need access to programs that can provide affordable, healthy, and ready-made food.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Venice Family Clinic and UCLA are fighting food insecurity by connecting hundreds of households to free, nutritious meals. With only 10% of students returning to campus last fall, UCLA sought a way to keep its dining workers employed that would help the community at large. UCLA and our Clinic saw an innovative path forward together: the university could deploy its staff to make meals for patients in need and we could supply the ingredients. Through the Emergency Food Partnership, UCLA Dining prepares about 2,500 take-home meals every weekday for distribution at Clinic sites. Nutrition and flavor are front and center. Imagine a bed of Spanish rice topped with grilled chipotle chicken, colorful organic veggies, and fresh salsa. This is the standard for every meal. Distributions are powered by our health education staff and volunteers, who conduct sign-ins and hand out packages to patients on foot and in cars. Patients receive four meals for themselves and for each member of their household weekly. We are hopeful that COVID case rates will continue to fall, and that soon, adults will return to work and students to school. Our program, however, cannot realistically be maintained at its current level after UCLA resumes at capacity. We know the program improves the health of our most vulnerable patients based on their feedback and the actual changes we see in their lab work. For this reason, we are committed to sustaining a smaller, tailored version for our highest need patients.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our tailored program will provide nearly 500 meals weekly to patients who will benefit most from regular access to healthy food, including those with uncontrolled diabetes and expectant mothers, and their families. In addition, patient participants will engage in online group classes based on the theme of embracing food as medicine to treat disease and achieve wellness. They will learn how to make healthful dishes on their own, watch live demos conducted in our Teaching Kitchen, create grocery budgets, and more. Our program will serve as a novel model for how a community-university partnership can successfully and sustainably target food insecurity. It will make Los Angeles a better place to live by ensuring people in need not only have access to nutritious meals but also to education that helps them build key skills and better understand the role between food and wellness. Importantly, by targeting entire families, our program has the potential to build intergenerational health.",

In 2018, the fashion sector was responsible for 2.1 billion metric tons of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, high unemployment rates have been linked to the lack of hard and soft skills. Ezrach’s goal is to bridge the skills gap in youth and the aging workforce by providing technical and soft skills training. LA County’s unemployment rate hit 12.7% as of January 2021. African Americans only hold 4% of household wealth, while White households hold 84% of household wealth (Moss et al., 2020). Leimert Park is located in Service Planning Area 6, which makes up the 80th percentile (25% highest scoring census tract) of poor air quality according to the CalEnviroScreen.

A typical class may include theatre games, slam poetry writing, music, drawn art and open discussion centered around such topics as the history of peaceful activism, local government, community organizing, etc. Each teaching team consists of an artist, a formerly incarcerated teacher, and a youth representative from the March For Our Lives anti-gun violence organization. The inclusion of peer teachers and people who are formerly incarcerated is vital to showing our students how powerful their voices can be. In 2020, we brought the program into all 7 LA County camps and halls virtually, due to COVID, and 100% of our students voted in the Presidential Election, an unprecedented turnout. In addition, we made connections between our students and March for Our Lives, so that they could join their local chapters upon returning home.

Our students have gone from answers like “How does my vote as a young, black, incarcerated woman matter as much as a white person's?”, to answers like “We have community. We built something in this short time...my peers, my brothers, we're all in this together.” Additionally we have been able to measure voter turnout amongst our students, which reached 100% in 2020.

A study from the National Center for Biotechnology Information describes how play activates the brain’s reward circuitry, which can facilitate attention and action. Through play, young people practice social interaction and build skills and interests to draw upon in the years to come, while also bringing down the barriers of gang affiliation and race that are so prevalent behind bars. This program inspires our students to raise their voices in their communities and become leaders in movements that create meaningful change, through play. We are firm believers that substantive, effective reform can only come from those who are impacted by the harms of systemic racism, a punitive justice system, poverty, and violence.

According to the 2020 Homeless Count 4,673 youth are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Los Angeles County, with 19% residing in Jovenes’ geographic area alone. Although the youth we serve come from diverse backgrounds, four common barriers to a stable future are found throughout our target population: barriers to safe, supportive, and affordable housing; difficulty accessing basic benefits and health services; limitations to educational advancement and economic development; and overcoming trauma.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Jovenes is seeking support to address the crisis of youth homelessness through our emergency/bridge-housing program at the former Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall. We are seeking to enhance the services we are able to provide with this program so our youth have the best opportunities to end their personal cycle of homelessness. Though there are other jail conversion projects taking place in Los Angeles, this is a first-of-its-kind program and one-of-a-kind to address the needs of the specific community that we serve, as there are no crisis/shelter housing beds dedicated to female youth in Southeast LA County. Up to 20 women can be housed in this program at a time, with an anticipated length of stay between three to six months. Through housing and supportive services/case management, we seek to provide youth with the resources and support they need to access vital benefits and physical/mental health care, gather personal identification documents, obtain employment, further their education, and ultimately move into longer term stable housing. From handcuffs to house keys, this program directly shows how de-prioritizing incarceration and focusing on helping youth meet their basic needs can help youth reintegrate into our community. A grant from My LA2050 will help Jovenes provide all the young women at Los Padrinos with the case management and resources necessary to achieve not just immediate needs, but also a long-term solution to end their personal cycles of homelessness.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Jovenes tracks the number of clients served at Los Padrinos, the services accessed, exit destinations, public benefits, and employment obtained. This allows us to evaluate the overall success of the program, as well as the success of subpopulations with specific needs and/or personal experiences. We communicate directly with clients to track our success in a qualitative manner to gain a first-hand perspective on the overall quality of our program. The feedback our youth provide to us helps us evaluate our program, track challenges each youth faces, & measure success as they overcome challenges. Since opening our doors in January 2021, we have already seen heightened success in our program, as we are operating at full capacity, and have already began to transition youth into longer-term housing.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 50",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our program at Los Padrinos is incredibly impactful to Los Angeles County, with the potential to create lasting change, as there is now a template and standard for these kinds of conversion projects. Other conversion projects have seen incredibly long timelines due to budgetary issues halting work and preventing completion. That is not the case with our work, in which LA County approved our project in late October 2020, and we had our first residents move on New Year’s Day, showing our rapid and effective development and implementation. There is a future for decreased incarceration, and increase in community support because we have ensured it is possible by providing a safe and stable place for homeless young women to live and thrive, by helping our youth become self-sufficient, which enables them to integrate back into their communities independently as empowered young adults.",

    "organization": "Los Angeles Choral Lab (LACL)",
    "summary": "The LA Soundwalk is your musical soundtrack to self-guided exploration of five of the city’s physical and human landscapes: beach, canyon, harbor, hills, and urban core. Through collaborations with community members, emerging composers, and local performers; sonic portraits of these diverse regions connect people with place, incite curiosity, and foster community. Anyone with a smartphone and headphones--from students to families and visitors--can immerse themselves in innovative music that sustainably interconnects, inspires, and empowers.",
    "goal": "CONNECT",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "The city of Los Angeles is vast, making it difficult for communities to feel connected and for citizens to connect with those in other regions and with backgrounds unlike their own. Visitors to the city often only superficially experience the incomparable mosaic of human and physical landscapes that make our city unique. Los Angeles is rich in diverse topographies and the diverse human experiences that shape them, yet incentives to leave our own neighborhoods or to stop and enjoy the beauty around us can be difficult to find, monotonous, or costly. While curricula across the city’s schools teach the history and culture of this place, experiences outside the classroom can feel uninspired or unattainable. Further, young composers, performers, and creatives lack opportunities to authentically showcase their work, and experimental choral music itself can appear esoteric and unattainable despite its ability to encapsulate the hybridity and complexity of the city’s history and inhabitants.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We are currently hosting SOUNDWALK in Griffith Park. Ticket sales are one key indicator, in addition to feedback collected from participants, composers, performers, and collaborators. A short documentary will depict some of this feedback, and basic demographic information collected in registration allows for evaluation of outreach. The quality of the works themselves also reflects the fulfillment of an ambitious musical goal. The extension of this project will include additional methods of measuring impact. Data from registrations in both launch parties as well as ongoing, self-guided experiences will measure the scope of impact. Some pieces may include interactive elements in which participants reflect on their observations and share through a public installation or online forum. Partnerships with music educators and other creators in the city will also indicate the possibilities provided by the endeavor. We may also produce an album and collect data on streaming this free resource.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "These organic, authentic creations will cause participants to feel a deeper connection to the city and its inhabitants, sparking curiosity and fostering empathy. The music uplifts diverse voices through collaboration and the elevation of emerging composers and local performers. Pieces intentionally reflect the character of varied neighborhoods, enticing both residents and visitors to explore beyond the habitual and superficial. The LA City Soundwalks will become a lasting way in which individuals and communities connect with their city and with one another. The Soundwalks can live on in perpetuity, free of charge, and visitors can return and experience the piece and place in a unique way each time. The Soundwalks will become opportunities to learn about the city and about experimental choral music. Launch parties will bring people together. Lesson plans based on the Soundwalks will address the history and culture of the place as well as the collaborative, innovative artistic process.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "The LA City Soundwalk allows both residents and visitors an ongoing, free, and unique opportunity to explore the various and diverse regions and communities of the city through interactive, self-paced sonic experiences that are based on and developed by the citizens of those regions. Tentative regions = Canyon: Franklin Canyon, Hollywood; Beach: Santa Monica Pier, Westside; Harbor: San Pedro, South Bay; City: Urban Core, Downtown; Hills: Kenneth Hahn Park, Mid-City. Anyone with a smartphone and headphones can travel to one of the Soundwalk sites and immerse themselves--on their own time and in their own way--in the multifaceted places that make LA special. Teachers can utilize this free resource to enhance pre-existing curricula, and community leaders can offer it to highlight the unique spirit of their neighborhood. Launch parties, staggered throughout the year, sustain interest and ensure that people of many backgrounds engage in the opportunity to connect with others and with the land. The music itself will interconnect and hybridize techniques, genres, and performance styles, using innovative technology to uplift experimental choral music and engage new audiences through accessible compositions and immersive experiences. Through targeted outreach and collaboration, not only will the experiences authentically leverage the diverse voices of the city, but they will also transform the city into a platform to showcase young talent through innovative, sustainable public art.",

Overwhelmingly students self report that the program, and working with journalist mentors has improved their self confidence and heightened their career ambitions and sparked an interest in journalism. They also report a new understanding and appreciation for their community. In the first “Voices” series, youth report at senior at Roosevelt High School Anayram Corona interviewed Carlos Montes, an activist in the Chicano movement. “It's very important to connect with older community members to not only learn lessons from the many stories they have to tell, but also to be able to share those stories with a larger group.

These types of intergenerational relationships help strengthen individuals and the community. Studies have shown these relationships offer benefits to youth such as improved academic performance, enhanced social skills and increased stability. Over the last decade BHB has a proven track record in the neighborhood and is a source the community relies on for information and engagement. A healthy community requires opportunities for residents to engage with each other and their leaders. Through its storytelling projects, BHB provides residents with these opportunities. By training youth as storytellers and conveners, BHB empowers youth as leaders and agents of change. BHB can partner with other local nonprofits to publish and exhibit these oral histories and create an even greater reach, deepening community connections. In this second installation of the project, we will go further to deepen our impact and reach and expand our work in some of Boyle Heights' most underserved areas, the neighborhood around the Ramona Gardens housing project.

Sixty-two percent of residents are low-income, with 62% also having limited English proficiency. Over the past decade, Boyle Heights Beat has catered to much of the community's need for information in Spanish by producing a bilingual print newspaper, website and podcast. This need has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 Pandemic, where limited information has been readily available to the Spanish speaking population. WIth disproportionately high numbers of COVID cases and deaths, the pandemic has also resulted in increased isolation of senior citizen residents, and increased rates of depression and anxiety among young people. With many youth no longer communicating in Spanish, the young and older populations are becoming further estranged from each other. This project is aimed at connecting these two groups, to create mutually beneficial relationships for both individuals and the community.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Research shows that aging adults play a critical role in the lives of young people, especially the most vulnerable in society. Intergenerational relationships are also crucial to happiness and well-being in our later years. The goal is to change social norms to encourage relationship building between generations. This storytelling project is one way to bring older adults and youth together, creating an opportunity for both to learn new skills and help create long-lasting relationships. These relationships can help cultivate a sense of purpose for both young and old, and help reduce isolation and the likelihood of depression. Through our storytelling project Voices, we hope that residents are able to better connect, to find new understanding and appreciation of each other, and a way to uplift each other and the issues facing the community- making Los Angeles a better place."

Stagnant incomes have combined with the dire shortage of affordable housing to produce a devastating homelessness crisis. Despite LA County providers housing more individuals than ever before in 2019, the lack of affordable housing is outpacing the sector’s capacity, resulting in 82,995 individuals falling into homelessness. The pandemic has only exacerbated this issue. The inability to meet this growing demand highlights the need for broad, structural reform. A key barrier in creating the systemic change necessary to address this crisis is a lack of education and awareness among the public and policymakers on the experience of homelessness and the varied factors perpetuating it. As such, ending homelessness in LA County requires changing the narrative around homelessness to garner widespread support for more equitable and informed policy solutions.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "With nearly 50 years of direct service experience, Union Station is well positioned to lead regionally-focused advocacy efforts to advance the structural reform necessary to end homelessness in LA County. In the coming year, Union Station will pilot a program designed to empower individuals with lived experience of homelessness to serve as advocates for more equitable and informed housing, criminal justice, and drug policies. Union Station will offer members of our Lived Expertise Advisory Panel (LEAP) advocacy training and facilitate opportunities to speak at community events including city council meetings. LEAP members, who are individuals who are currently or have formerly experienced homelessness, will be paid a stipend for participation in monthly LEAP meetings and for speaking events, and will also receive a gift at the end of the year, such as furniture or other home goods, as compensation for their work. Given the expertise conferred by lived experience, Union Station believes LEAP members are uniquely equipped to educate others about the causes of and solutions to homelessness. To engage the broader community in this work, Union Station will launch a new texting platform to share information about advocacy and civic engagement opportunities, local elections and ballot initiatives, and community events. We aim to lead one texting campaign per month with the goal of changing the narrative around homelessness and advancing equitable policies at the local level."

Core to the LANLT's mission and key to its successful model are the equally important pillars of organizing, design and development, and stewardship. The first phase of a new park, garden or renovation project always starts with deep community engagement and stakeholder involvement, where residents help to identify spaces and envision the projects by identifying their priorities. Through door-to-door outreach, workshops, focus groups, park-based events, and monthly meetings, we develop not only residents who engage in their own neighborhood vision, but resident leaders who take pride and steward their open spaces. Key to our successful model is our Park and Garden Stewardship Program, which engages local community residents to be the caretakers of their neighborhood greenspaces. This unique approach to operating, maintaining and activating our parks and gardens fosters both community ownership and economic development. LANLT Stewards help to ensure that our sites are clean and safe so that they can continue to serve as welcoming community spaces promoting mental wellbeing and healthy lifestyles.

A 2016 countywide analysis of green space found that communities with very high or high park need were 90% predominately communities of color. One’s race, income, and geography have come to predict whether that individual has access to a park or garden. Additionally, a direct correlation exists between park-poor neighborhoods and poor health. There is a 12-year life expectancy gap across LA County, as well as higher rates of childhood obesity and premature mortality from cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Green space access correlates to public health benefits, including lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, lower self-reported stress, lower rates of crime and domestic violence, and improved air and water quality.",

The trauma they have experienced – through no fault of their own – increases the likelihood of learning and behavioral problems, lowers academic outcomes, and causes difficulty in regulating emotions. Children of color in foster care with disabilities face biases that cause over and underrepresentation in special education and harsh school discipline. This often results in poor outcomes for these youth. In fact, California’s foster youth have a 56% graduation rate compared to 85% of all students. The Covid-19 pandemic has further heightened the need to address the wide equity gap that exists in our education system.

We will ensure that they are getting assessed to identify their special needs, enrolled at regional centers and school districts for early intervention services, and receiving any compensatory services due to Covid-19 closures. We also will educate the families with these young children in their care, on the importance of early childhood interventions to mitigate the effects of trauma and developmental delays in babies and toddlers. We will teach these caregivers and parents to identify and understand developmental milestones and how to navigate the complex system of early intervention services for their children. At the same time, to promote equity and improve the educational systems these children will soon enter, we will train school professionals on identifying and reducing racial bias in school and on how to create trauma-informed learning environments that meet the needs of foster children so they can remain in the classroom, heal, and learn.",

Currently, there is no physical space for the LGBTQ+ community to gather, especially LGBTQ+ youth. With over one-sixth of Gen Z identifying as queer and this is likely to increase with future generations, the SGV's LGBTQ+ community requires a physical safe space, where there is otherwise none. The SGV needs this now more than ever given the rise in attacks aimed at people of color and the LGBTQ+ community. SGV residents are predominantly those of Latinx (45%) and Asian (28%) descent. The SGV LGBTQ+ Center serves a unique population in terms of both geography and demographics. We are a unique community and require a safe space to meet our unique needs.",

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Literary production can feel like an insider's world, concentrated in and around New York’s publishing scene and largely dominated by a handful of ever-consolidating corporations. California’s thriving independent publishing houses have long offered more inclusive, diverse, and adventurous alternatives, but lack the interconnective network, outreach infrastructure, and financial resources wielded by larger firms. Independent literary arts organizations, driven by community rather than pure profit, serve communities often underrepresented in and misrepresented by big trade publishing. LITLIT offers local independent publishers and literary arts organizers the opportunity to forge and reinforce direct connections with their readers and fellow professionals. By bringing together California’s literary arts community and the reading public, LITLIT will foster a more diverse cultural landscape, increasing access to the arts for writers, publishers, readers, and curious passers-by alike.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Cutting-edge and attuned to the needs of local communities, independent presses in California have done much to shape Los Angeles’s cultural identity. LITLIT will strengthen public and institutional support for their work and bring broader recognition of the vibrant literary community here in LA. It will also foster access to and engagement in the world of literary production, especially among readers and writers from underserved populations. By bringing together publishers and readers, LITLIT will help each of our exhibitors, which have included Tia Chucha, World Stage Press, Kaya Press, Red Hen, and others, to increase their audiences and better tailor their products to the communities they serve. LITLIT exposes the public to local literary communities, generating dozens of new library card enrollments each day and a long list of new volunteers for programs such as WordsUncaged. Our goal is to attract at least 6,000 members of the public in 2022.",

LITLIT 2019, co-hosted by LARB and Hauser & Wirth Publishers, welcomed over 5,000 visitors across two days, and our goal is to host over 6,000 this year. Exhibitors reported that they sold more books at LITLIT than at other book fairs and events, and some sold out on the first day. We have learned that regular in-person check-ins with exhibitors are essential during the event to create a welcoming and casual atmosphere conducive to a positive experience. After the event, we also provided exhibitors with emailed surveys for more extensive feedback about the quality and efficacy of the event, details regarding the number of products exhibitors sold and new contacts and collaborations made, and their willingness to participate in future events.

Attendees will have the opportunity to mingle with booksellers, authors, publishers, and organizers from their communities, and to engage in printing workshops and other interactive craft projects. We will feature panels and discussions between literary artists and publishers on a range of topics. We will tailor programming to the groups and causes our exhibitors serve, inviting those interested to not only participate in panels, but also to cultivate these discussions with us. This year, we plan to feature conversations on topics such as Politics & Publishing, Art & Poetry Across Borders, Adaptations from Page to Screen, and more. This grant will facilitate participation from small presses and nonprofit publishers by helping us offer exhibitors booths free of charge, rather than at the often prohibitive standard rates of $350–950+ for comparable events and conferences. It will also support advertising and outreach efforts to communities all over Los Angeles and fund panel discussions, which will be recorded and uploaded onto LARB’s YouTube channel and website to maximize content accessibility and engagement, and for archival purposes.",

    "summary": "With an aim to transform healthy food access and wellness through people, social enterprise and environmental justice, CultivaLA uses green spaces to empower immigrant and low-income communities across Los Angeles to grow and obtain fresh foods in their neighborhood. Using a community-centered and intergenerational approach, CultivaLA engages, educates and empowers community members from low-income communities to use urban agriculture practices and understand the importance of green spaces in providing fresh and healthy food to the community.",

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "According to the U.S. Economic Census, low-income neighborhoods have two to three times less access to healthy food in their neighborhood. Lack of healthy food options leads to food insecurity, which Feeding America indicates as having serious negative effects on the physical and mental development, academic achievement, and economic futures of youth. Seeing food deserts and food insecurity as social justice issues that disproportionately affect the poorest communities, CultivaLA advocates for the transformation of green spaces across Los Angeles, so they may be used for urban agriculture. Studies find over 25% of California’s population in 2019 identifies as an immigrant, which also makes for an incredible need to support immigrant integration as they are often subjected to racism and relegated to bad, low-wage jobs. As a result, CultivaLA sees urban agriculture as an expression of immigrant agency, with immigrants using homeland seeds and plants to anchor in a new place.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "CultivaLA is a community-driven organization, working directly with cultiva-dores, who use their previous experience in farming from home countries to grow food resources in an urban setting. CultivaLA honors the experiences of immigrant communities and provides opportunities for them to use their skills to bring healthy food to underserved communities. CultivaLA also educates the overall community through urban agriculture workshops and training to promote workforce development, mentorship, and entrepreneurship for youth and adults. These programs are developing, and are aimed at building intergenerational connections, increasing self-efficacy and resilience of low-income communities, and promoting older adult well-being through urban agriculture. In 2020, CultivaLA adjusted its programming to provide an Emergency COVID-19 Grab and Go Produce Distribution, which provided over 90,000 pounds (lbs) of fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables to families in the Westlake community, who were disproportionately affected by COVID-19. CultivaLA aims to continue providing free, grab and go food and produce through distributions to combat food insecurity and ensure local communities have access to healthy food during the grant period. CultivaLA currently oversees urban farming at various locations within LA County: Westlake Community Garden, Cesar Chavez Community Garden, St. Teresa of Avila Community Garden, Earthworks Farm, and City of Rosemead Community Wellness Garden.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "As we aim to empower local cultiva-dores and community members to grow fresh herbs and vegetables at our urban garden sites, we will define and measure success via the following objectives: 1) Number of meals or units of fresh food provided to the community through harvesting and distribution activities; 2) Number of participants attending environmental programs/events at urban agriculture sites; 3) Number of individuals reporting a positive experience at urban agriculture sites; and 4) Number of individuals reporting an overall improvement in well-being due to involvement at urban agriculture sites. We will accomplish the aforementioned measurement and evaluation outcomes through registration forms, program surveys (pre/post), and food resource tracking and documentation from vendors and partners. We look forward to providing LA2050 with the outcomes of these metrics at the end of the grant period.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We hope our work will provide a place of respite for undocumented, immigrant, and low-income communities, who are often excluded or disregarded in other spaces in Los Angeles. As these groups tend to the garden, they also tend to themselves, as they practice self-care, share their experiences, and recreate intergenerational bonds with others in the community. Through the collective transformation of discarded urban patches of ground into oases of freedom, belonging, and homeland connection, we hope these urban agriculture sites also serve as inspiration and hope, while providing for the food needs of the community through harvesting of herbs and vegetables. Urban agriculture can offer a portal to understanding our social and existential conditions, especially as global migration is fundamental to this region and to the era in which we live. As a result, CultivaLA hopes its mission and programming will best support communities in a variety of ways, today, and in the future.",

SFC program staff conduct surveys with all recipients of pantry services through an annual internal census and provide evaluations as part of our rental and utility assistance program. We have consistent open conversations to find out about the needs of families and individuals and ways to incorporate this feedback into more client-centered services. For example, within the last year, with feedback from our community, we developed our pantry delivery program and Tuesday diaper distribution.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, L.A. already had the largest food-insecure population in the nation, with one in five people living with food insecurity. Now in the current COVID-19 climate, this has jumped to one in four households. One hundred percent of the guests that St. Francis Center (SFC) serves are homeless or extremely low-income. Anecdotally, we are aware that a large percentage of our guests are undocumented, and as they are not eligible for government assistance, pantry programs like ours are the last resort. As SFC continues to navigate through the pandemic, our mission to be a reliable source of hunger relief and comprehensive support services for our community is more important than ever. A quote from a guest illustrates the need, “My husband has been in the hospital. He has been there for a few weeks, and we had no money. We didn't know what to do. We didn't think we would be able to afford food. This service is a really big deal for us.”",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our vision is to reduce food insecurity in our community while providing our guests with tools to facilitate healthy living and tools to enable stable living. This year, we aim to host at least 40,000 total visits to our pantry programs and encourage consistent weekly use of our program. Each pantry program recipient will receive at least 60 pounds of groceries (primarily focusing on fresh produce, meat, and dairy) each visit. We will provide resource and utility assistance to 130 families. Through our homeless breakfast program, we will provide 64,000 warm, wholesome breakfasts and lunches to our guests. We will distribute at least 2,500 hygiene kits to our homeless guests during the program. We will provide resource services to 1,475 guests and case management to 25 guests. These resources assist with health and human service needs, reducing stress and increasing awareness of opportunities. This leads to less homelessness and a greater chance for guests to improve their situation.",

Last year we served 75,000 meals to guests in a modified to-go format to ensure social distancing. Our mobile shower partner, the CARE team through the City of LA, provides on-site showers every Tuesday. Our resource team distributes hygiene kits during breakfast hours, and hosts a resource table located outside the center to offer supportive services to our guests. SFC provides hunger relief services through our weekly on-site pantry services, bimonthly satellite pantries at four partner locations, and pop-up pantries on an “as-needed” basis in food deserts throughout L.A. Pantry program recipients receive an average of 60 pounds of fresh, nutritious groceries once a week. In 2020, we experienced a staggering 70% increase in the number of visits to our pantry programs, accommodating 39,583 visits compared to 22,415 visits in 2019. All of SFC’s hunger relief programs provide an opportunity to introduce individuals and families to SFC’s supportive services, giving them access to tools to improve their lives. Resources include hygiene kits, DMV ID vouchers, emergency clothing, phone access, transportation, information and resources, as well as rental and utility assistance. Use of these services increased 60% last year, from 1,335 visits in 2019 to 2,140 in 2020, illustrating in stark numbers the economic impact of the pandemic."

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our app guides youth through a journey to build skills and community: “Discovery”: Youth are invited to explore the app. We help them create a customized plan and meet core group coaches – volunteers and former foster youth. On a community feed, youth engage with supportive peers and volunteers, setting a positive tone for their journey. “Core Groups”: Youth in crisis are fast-tracked. Otherwise, based on their plan, they are welcomed into: education, employment, housing, finances, and self-care. The goal is to move them out of “survival mode” quickly by assigning content and small tasks. Youth earn points and badges as they advance. “Elective Groups”: Youth are then eligible to join groups, discussions, and events related to fitness, travel, music, and whatever else they wish to learn from our 100+ speakers and volunteers. Long term, we aim to: - Increase high school graduation, college matriculation, and employment - Improve confidence, connectedness, and sense of agency",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Many youth learn life skills – opening a bank account, applying for a job, renting an apartment – from family. Youth aging out of foster care don't, and the moment they exit, they lose support of social workers, judges, lawyers, and group home staff. By age 26, 50% are unemployed and 30% are homeless. SFLA helps youth step confidently into the future by filling gaps in the system: 1. We put youth in the driver’s seat. In the system, decisions are made for youth, keeping them from developing agency. We help them identify what they want and build decision-making skills. 2. We emphasize thriving. Youth are used to survival mode. Current approaches to helping them exit care emphasize housing and jobs – essential but not enough. We help them envision an exciting future by exposure to things beyond their current reality. 3. We create community. Without support, adulthood is isolating. We introduce youth to a network of peers and trusted adults who help them build hope and confidence.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Our one-of-a-kind mobile app, designed by a team of former foster youth, app guides youth on a journey to prepare for – and get excited about – their future. In addition to improving outcomes for youth, we have an ambitious vision for our app: That it transforms the foster care system's current approach to helping youth transition from care, providing those who support them with a modernized, youth-centered toolkit and format. Most youth we serve have access to smart phones and are accustomed to using social media. Our app provides an online community and a centralized library of engaging content and resources curated specifically for youth exiting care – a “one-stop shop” to build skills, get support, and explore opportunities. Given the popularity of short-form video as a communication medium, the key vehicle for delivering information through our app is short, engaging instructional videos. In addition to linking to existing online resources, we provide opportunities for volunteers and former foster youth within our community - and eventually app users themselves - to produce and share original content. Funding will help us engage and guide 400 youth through the app to gather feedback on our beta version. We will also establish recurring paid internship positions for youth who demonstrate a commitment to their goals and an interest in improving the app. In addition to creating 24 job opportunities each year, this will ensure our app stays relevant and youth-friendly.",

We expect that key beneficiaries of our app will be: 1) Court system: Judges, attorneys, and court-appointed special advocates 2) Other youth-serving nonprofits 3) Group homes and residential facilities 4) Department of Children and Family Services: social workers and youth case managers All partners will be able to benefit from the app, which improves the current approach to helping youth prepare for and transition from care.",

At the same time, women have become the fastest growing percentage of the prison population. Post-incarceration, women face even greater trauma, steeper barriers and fewer resources than men. Women return home from prison to stigma, economic precarity, and a lack of supportive services. As the 2019 Prison Policy Initiative briefing states: “Given the dramatic growth of women’s incarceration in recent years, it’s concerning how little attention and how few resources have been directed to meeting the reentry needs of justice-involved women”. For trans and gender non-conforming people, discrimination adds to the impacts of structural racism and gender-based discrimination.

We put into practice the principle of “Care Not Cages,” by centering the needs of people coming out of prison, most of whom are Black, Brown, Indigenous and LGBTQI. Guided by our formerly incarcerated leaders, we are collectively building an arts based center for healing, education and community. In response to the urgent needs of people leaving prison, we provide paid work opportunities and job training in design, production and distribution of the People’s Bowl and other homewares. We offer part-time work on a flexible schedule that provides economic stability to people in reentry. PPP offers ceramics classes free of cost to formerly incarcerated individuals. Arts programming is essential for healing trauma and helps recently incarcerated women establish a sense of self, power, and hope. This program offers an inspiring pairing of women in reentry and PPP staff, who have navigated this transition home successfully and are leaders in their community. PPP recognizes the need for grassroots advocacy led by directly impacted communities. One of the primary barriers for formerly incarcerated people to advocate for systems change is economic stress and inflexible, low-wage jobs. PPP centers advocacy by encouraging leaders to participate in coalitional movements to provide safety, healing, and dignity for formerly incarcerated people.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "At People’s Pottery Project, we celebrate the freedom of every person who is released from a life sentence and walks from the prison gates; our goal is to create a community for them to come home to. Our mission is to provide every disenfranchised formerly incarcerated individual access to a therapeutic arts practice and paid vocational training. Over the next year, with increased support, we will expand our programming to provide 6500 hours of free therapeutic classes for women in reentry and paid training for formerly incarcerated individuals. We will increase sales and production of the People’s Bowl, and in the process hire an additional full time member to develop professional work experience in a holistic and supportive environment. This year we will develop the advocacy that is at the center of PPP, by providing support for our members to move into pre-existing coalitional spaces to continue fighting for the needs of formerly incarcerated women and trans people.",

We have provided paid job training, leadership development, and trauma-informed management systems. PPP has partnered with A New Way of Life Reentry Project to offer free ceramics classes to women in re-entry. We have provided 180 hours of our paid ceramics program to formerly incarcerated people. We have had six features in prominent arts publications, bringing visibility to our community and the issues we face while transforming public narratives about incarcerated individuals. Looking forward, one way we will measure our success is by expanding the hours our formerly incarcerated leaders spend working directly with target communities: people in re-entry, formerly incarcerated individuals, and non-system impacted members of the community.",

In 2020, 4,775 youth experienced homelessness in LA County, a 19% increase over previous year. Homeless youth are more likely to be Black or Latinx due to systemic racism and trauma. To promote racial equity and stop generational poverty, comprehensive service-enriched programming is crucial in mitigating barriers to stability. In LA County, homeless youth must seek needed services at multiple locations, making it difficult to receive help. RightWay provides all supportive services in house, ensuring youth have the tools to propel themselves to stability. Our trauma-informed programs address the complexity of their needs and provide comprehensive support to overcome obstacles to a healthy adulthood. Operation Housing First will serve as a model, showing how universal basic income and/or rental assistance combined with intensive services transforms lives and possibilities for our most vulnerable youth.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Data shows that RightWay’s revolutionary, multidimensional approach is transforming outcomes for foster and reentry youth. Last year, 70% of participants secured and retained employment/paid-internship. 86% of participants have stable housing; 24% are enrolled in college. 90% of participants reported an increase in social support and a decrease in social isolation; 86% of participants receiving mental health services reported progress toward identified treatment goals; 80% experienced a decrease in symptoms and behaviors related to their mental health diagnoses. 86% who complete our programs return for supportive services. Only 2% have faced incarceration since being in our program. RightWay is breaking generational cycles of poverty and trauma. Together with our youth, RightWay creates a secure community that provides a sense of possibility that enables youth to move beyond structural and psychological barriers and prevent retraumatization and marginalization in adulthood.",

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Within 18 months of leaving foster care, over 40% of foster youth will become homeless. Nationally, 50% of the homeless population spent time in foster care. 65% of youth leaving foster care need immediate housing upon discharge. Within less than 12 months of release, more than 80% of transition-age youth who have been incarcerated or justice involved experience homelessness. This crisis is exacerbated by the limited availability of transitional housing, high cost of living, inflated rental market, and high rate of unemployment. In LA County, over 50% of former foster youth will be unemployed by age 24, while those employed earn an average of only $7,500 a year. The unemployment rate of former foster youth is rooted in unresolved trauma from the foster care system, with the rate of PTSD for former foster youth more than twice that American war veterans, and structural racism that compounds trauma and increases risk of socioeconomic immobility."

While Internet Services Providers (ISPs) are required to offer low-cost options, most do little to market these offerings. Research shows that up to 70% of consumers who qualify for these low-cost programs are unaware of their existence. This makes the process of finding an affordable internet plan difficult to navigate for households already experiencing the stress of financial instability. To combat this, our Programs Team conducts rigorous outreach efforts within communities with low internet adoption rates. We form relationships with schools, community-based organizations, and other nonprofits to identify households that could benefit from low-cost broadband options. Through our community partnerships and word of mouth, we’re able to expand our internet assistance program and encourage people without home internet to contact us for assistance at no cost to them. Our team of Internet Assistance Advocates then supports eligible households by educating residents on the various plans that are available to them based on income level, zip code, and other demographic factors.

With its insufficient access to nutritious food, South LA has the highest rate of diet-related death in LA County. Eating habits start young. Nine out of ten children in the US eat too few vegetables (CDC, 2014). And when it comes to getting kids to eat vegetables, access isn't the only factor. Research shows that when kids encounter growing vegetables, vegetables in general become less scary, and kids eat them. But South LA has drastically insufficient green space. There are few places for kids to encounter any growing plants, much less growing vegetables.

Students learn valuable leadership skills, meet local leaders, gain experience in organizing, and collaborate on tactics for making change. This four-month program incorporates community-building exercises in which each student develops a “public narrative,” a practice of storytelling that connects their personal experiences to larger public issues facing Los Angeles. Students then participate in three learning modules consisting of one-hour long Zoom meetings as well as individual and collaborative projects. The modules cover the foundations of youth voter engagement, opportunities to improve youth voter registration policies, and organizing nonpartisan voter registration efforts. Each project provides students with opportunities to use a variety of methods to overcome challenges to youth voter participation. Participants also serve as role models to high school students across the County, encouraging them to promote voter registration in their schools and to support policies promoting youth voter registration.

We also measure changes in county-wide preregistration rates through reports generated by the California Secretary of State, and we measure overall registration rates and turnout rates among young voters with the aid of the LA County voter file. We know our approach works because we have been implementing similar programs for two years. Most of the students we train go on to hold voter registration drives. Nationwide, students who have gone through our programs (Future Voters Action Week (FVAW), High School Voter Registration Week (HSVRW), the 2020 Youth Fellowship, and online workshops).

In early 2020, LA saw more than 66,000 of our neighbors experience homelessness—a number set to skyrocket post-eviction moratorium. In LA County, 685,000 jobs have been lost. Compounded by rising rents, housing shortages, poor health, and more, the pandemic recession is projected to push another 52,300 adults out of their homes. Chronic homelessness is also set to increase in LA by 86% over the next four years. Our Black neighbors are impacted most, representing 34% of the homeless population yet only 8% of LA.

Our project’s design places LeaseUp staff as liaisons between landlords and case managers from countywide agencies. They engage and support landlords, acquire units, facilitate lease-up, work with case managers, and address any future issues during a tenant’s lease. On average, it takes three months for a case manager to conduct this process independently and LeaseUp significantly reduces or eliminates that. To date, they have worked with 4,632 landlords and 2,654 case managers from 102 different agencies. PATH’s new LeaseUp Lived Expertise Advisory Board will help increase this amazing success and ensure that this work includes our most marginalized neighbors and directly addresses their disproportionate housing barriers.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "An LA2050 grant will help create a Lived Expertise Advisory Board to strengthen PATH’s existing LeaseUp LA initiative, a countywide landlord engagement effort to expand the affordable rental market. Launched in 2018, LeaseUp accelerates housing availability by 1) working with landlords to list their market rate units as affordable and 2) building the PATH-App, a rental listing site that any LA case manager can access for their clients. LeaseUp has since acquired thousands of units and is a key COVID re-housing strategy. PATH seeks to build a LeaseUp Lived Expertise Advisory Board to ensure our critical work is culturally competent, person-centered, and effective. It will comprise formerly homeless LeaseUp participants. They will lend their perspective to assess our overall landlord engagement strategy, review messaging and marketing, and make sure that implementation is aligned with our population’s needs. We will hire an associate director to lead our Lived Expertise Advisory Board and our existing Landlord Advisory Board. They will work with our leadership and meet with other advocates in similar roles to develop a recruitment strategy. At the advisory board kickoff, the members will convene virtually and develop guidelines, expectations, meeting frequency, and more. We will immerse them in LeaseUp, hear and apply recommendations, and uplift their advocacy efforts in local government. Our project is unique because it allows the people being served to guide the service.",

Without the worry of daily survival, they will be able to stabilize their health and finances, reintegrate into the community, and thrive. Many landlords who contribute their units to us are smaller and rely on this income to support their families. PATH’s efforts will support these individuals who have also been severely impacted in the pandemic recession. At the macro level, PATH’s LeaseUp Lived Expertise Advisory Board seeks to create equitable, accessible housing for Angelenos. Our top priority has always been those we serve and launching this advisory board will take us to the next level. Their voice on what needs to change in LA’s housing market will help inform practices and policies on how to embrace those in need. By first rethinking processes on the ground level, PATH hopes to embed in LA’s culture that everyone deserves a home.",

Meaningful Messaging for Birth Equity Advocacy means decimating the information collected from the group and translating that into powerful imagery and language. We plan to take the tenacity and urgency this issue needs to every platform and expand our reach as much as possible into the most underserved areas and to the most underserved communities. The Black Mom Listening Tour is the second leg of the Birth Equity Awareness Campaign. By conducting coalition building in our most regionally impacted areas we will use stakeholder influence to launch an engagement campaign. Coordinated Resource Building, is the final approach in our messaging campaign focused on provider education.

Learning skills, making career connections, practicing entrepreneurship, and gaining food sovereignty will empower individuals who are poorly served by existing education and employment options. Furthermore, individuals who receive urban farmer training, career guidance, and subsidized apprenticeships and land access will improve food security and health for their families and community. Creating career paths, business networks, and a support system for urban farming careers promotes both economic and environmental sustainability in a neighborhood lacking these benefits.

Earlier community meetings revealed residents’ desires to learn more about urban farming, and our current gardening students aspire to go deeper with additional training in business, sustainable food systems, and best practices for maximizing food production. To address food insecurity, food quality, and unemployment, Watts residents need skills, knowledge, supports, and connections. To be viable, career pathways should include education, built-in business connections, subsidized launchpads, and social safety net supports.

Our newest site, 2.5-acre MudTown Farms, boasts a multipurpose building, greenhouse, orchard, aquaponics, composting, flower beds, and vegetable cultivation on historic, fertile, unbuilt and uncontaminated farmland. MudTown Farms’ innovative urban farming course will include subsidized apprenticeships, land access, and customized farm business planning. Urban farming offers both individual and community economic improvement by reducing food costs, improving diet quality, and producing a good return on investment. Even with barriers of limited language, education, and startup capital, Watts residents can gain useful, employable skills in a growing business sector, with scalable entrepreneurial options. Coordinated individual urban farmer action can increase the entire community’s capacity for food production, food access, employment, and self-determination, contributing to both economic and environmental sustainability.

Income gained from employment and/or entrepreneurship will demonstrate individual economic success. Economically and ecologically sustainable urban farming ventures will demonstrate successful farm plans. Student pre- and post-program self-assessment of personal and family food insecurity and healthy food access will measure health improvements. An Advisory Council of at least 5 individuals will demonstrate connections to wider LA-area farm/food ventures.

The “Ballona Nature Is in Play” publication will provide information about the watershed, space to sketch nature sightings during self-guided tours, and will include details about how to visit using public transportation. Offered as a download and in print, in English and Spanish, the publication has the potential to connect thousands of people to nature in the Los Angeles Basin, in a safe, self-paced, socially distant way.

Barriers to participation in nature activities include lack of access to safe green space within walking distance, lack of transportation to more distant greenspace, unfamiliarity with how to access greenspaces using public transportation, fear and lack of understanding about plants and wildlife, and not feeling welcome or safe.

Safe parking not only offers stability such as a place to park, safety through paid security, reengagement with community members from the faith-based and/or host site organizations, good night's rest without worry of being harassed, ticketed, or towed, but safe parking also helps create a path to becoming housed. While the ultimate goal of the safe parking program is to ensure affordable and sustainable housing through its connection and network of case management and housing provider services, the COVID-19 pandemic has created another layer and acute need for solutions like safe parking to be implemented because congregate shelters offer less protection from the virus. In fact, sleeping in a vehicle may be a healthier option than sleeping in a congregate shelter or on the street.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "With the collaboration of Foothill Unity Center, Trinity Lutheran Church and MHCH's SGV Safe Parking Committee, a pilot program is being launched in Pasadena to become a model, showing how working together with faith-based organizations can help solve homelessness on a small scale, one parking space at a time. Through this pilot program, the following services will be provided: designated overnight parking spaces, case management, food, housing navigation, problem solving interventions, paid security, partnerships that help to re-weave the relational network, charging stations, a place to receive mail, and possibly showers and laundry services. The overall goal of this program is to develop a model to be replicated in order to help with the homeless crisis. Through current resources and leveraging we are able to provide the pilot program for four months. This grant will support a team that will assure the continuation and growth of this program and will support the assessments and development of a sustainable plan and a plan for replication anywhere.

Those in the program will live more stable and productive lives, contributing to the community in a a myriad of ways including positive contributions into the health of the community. Fewer people experiencing homelessness will mean less stress on our healthcare and social services systems and more resources freed up for recreational, arts, and education programs that will contribute to the vibrancy of the San Gabriel Valley area. In addition, volunteers and churches will benefit by growing in their capacity to reach out to some of our most vulnerable neighbors of our community; through safe parking, the vision that meets that need to give becomes viable. A whole new group of people will have an experience of knowing people in different circumstances, creating a more diverse and, therefore, stronger community in the SGV that has an experience of pulling together and leaving no one behind."

LGBT+ youth also experience higher rates of suicide. According to the CDC, 70% of Latino LGBT girls felt sad and hopeless almost everyday. 95% of Southeast LA identifies as Latino and the median household income is two-thirds of the LA County average. 56% of households have a higher housing cost of burden than the California average. Research shows that those same households spend less on food and other essentials meaning many families cannot afford to purchase basic gear for their children to pursue an interest in music-making, much less pay for private instruction.",

As a result there are many barriers preventing local farmers’ produce from reaching Calfresh shoppers in Los Angeles. One of which is that California grown produce can be expensive for small markets to purchase, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. Thus making locally grown produce not easily accessible for Calfresh shoppers. One of the reasons for this is that California grown produce is sought after produce, globally. Making the market extremely competitive, and sometimes too costly for small markets in low-income neighborhoods. This program is seeking to address the barriers between connecting Calfresh shoppers and small markets to local farmers of color. The Farm Fresh LA program does the work for the farmers, markets, and Calfresh shoppers to make local produce affordable for the market to provide and the Calfresh shopper to purchase.",

When BGCP’s Clubhouses reopened last summer, BGCP created small, self-contained, socially distanced “pods” at each Clubhouse with a dedicated staff member. Each pod belongs to one of several Houses, which are diverse in their identity and positive values. For example, the Amistad House evokes Spanish heritage and fosters friendship and self-discovery. Weekly, Club members in their Houses work on group projects which develop skills and knowledge, foster collaboration, and reinforce academic concepts. Projects culminate in weekly challenges, where Houses present their learning and compete for points based on participation and collaboration. Projects have focused on racial justice, Hispanic heritage, education, ecology, fitness, and space exploration. House challenges occur via Google Hangout, so that pods can remain in their areas, and both Clubhouses can participate together. Through the Houses, members deepen their social connections and build their sense of belonging, areas identified in research as key to sustaining children’s mental health. BGCP piloted this Initiative last summer and continued it this school year based on positive feedback. BGCP seeks to expand the Initiative and continue it beyond COVID-19. Specifically, the Club plans to design more STEM-related challenges, with Houses showcasing scientific experiments and careers available in the STEM fields.",

There are two main criteria to gauge the success of the ClubHouse Initiative. The first is a year-over-year increase in members’ sense of belonging at the Club. This is important because a strong sense of belonging is a critical factor in children’s mental health. It is also a strong indicator of continued Club attendance, which reaps additional benefits, including increased high school graduation rates (BGCP seniors have had a 100% on-time graduation rate for several years) and increased academic proficiency. The second criterion for success will be the full development of a ClubHouse Initiative toolkit by March 2022, which will be freely available to interested youth-serving organizations.",

The problem of high population density must be confronted effectively to guarantee better management of these problems. Research has shown a positive correlation between population density and obesity in middle aged and older adults. In 2020, a global study of the virus demonstrated a link between the virus’ spread and population density. Often, Population density is the culprit of many of the cities’ pain points. How does Building Community in an Urban Green Space address these urban problems? Building Community will confront population density by bridging the connection between increasing open garden hours, program benefits, and program participation.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Increased hours, an available garden workforce, and community support, all anchored by a friendly green space, are the primary targets for the grant funding. To serve residents of the high density area, this program will start by increasing the number of scheduled hours at the garden. The goal will be to create a maximum number of garden engagement opportunities during this grant program period. During scheduled hours, visitors should have direct access to planned enrichment offered through innovative workshops, events, and other garden engagement. In addition to making increased scheduled hours possible, this grant should also fund the planned enrichment including innovative workshops, events, and other garden engagements. The costs associated with this project will be controlled under marketing, entertainment, transportation, and labor budgets for Extended Hours and Community Engagement. This Building Community model is unique in that it will require stakeholders to actively engage solutions to population density by growing their community garden.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Around the world, millions suffer from treatable health conditions due to a lack of access to basic medical supplies. Meanwhile, the U.S. healthcare system annually disposes of twelve billion pounds of unused, usable medical supplies and equipment valued on the order of billions of dollars. In fact, the medical sector is the second-largest contributor to landfills, accounting for 8% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. The current paradigm propagates economic inefficiency, environmental burden, and avoidable human suffering. With this in mind, Blueprints For Pangaea is an international, student-run 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to addressing global health care inequalities. In order to bridge the gap between surplus and need, we use our national network of university chapters to redirect life-saving medical supplies away from landfills and into the hands of medical professionals that make a difference where it is most needed: on a global scale.",

Primarily, we will measure pounds of medical supplies shipped and calculate the worth of the medical supplies by maintaining a comprehensive inventory of our supplies and shipments. We continually seek to amplify our impact by partnering with socially-conscious hospitals and clinics that do not have systems in place to address surplus medical supplies. We will measure the number of nonprofits and hospitals that we partner with. In doing so, we will be able to utilize data on the demographics and number of people within the communities that these partners impact. This will allow us to calculate the number of people and types of people who are gaining access to our donated medical supplies in L.A. county.",

As a social enterprise, Blueprints For Pangaea is a network of university chapters united in addressing global health care inequalities by reallocating excess, unused medical supplies—that would otherwise be discarded—from U.S. hospitals and suppliers to oversea countries who are in need. With fewer medical resources to process, our partner hospitals are able to cut expenses and reduce their environmental footprints while gaining community goodwill. Since we obtain medical resources via donation, we can in turn offer them to foreign hospitals at massively subsidized prices, thereby enabling affordable, higher-quality patient care in areas of need. If provided, this grant will support Blueprints For Pangaea’s newly founded University of Southern California chapter, whose primary beneficiary in all of the aforementioned is the greater Los Angeles community and its salient urban health needs.",

    "summary": "Every child has the right to build a loving relationship with their parents, even if a parent is in prison. Keeping children connected with incarcerated parents has been shown to improve the health and wellbeing of children, to reduce recidivism rates, and build stronger communities. Beyond the Bus is a transformative program that offers children the chance to maintain connection and personal relationships with a parent in prison through virtual visits and expanded opportunities for in-person visits after the pandemic.",
    "goal": "CONNECT",
    "projectRanking": "Winner",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Children are often denied the chance to connect with a parent in prison, either because the parent is too far away to visit or because children can’t afford the cost of expensive phone calls or car rides. Estimates suggest more than 80,000 children in LA County have a parent behind bars (pre-pandemic). 60% of incarcerated parents in California report being more than 100 miles away from their families. Parental incarceration impacts the whole family: loss of family income, the daily absence of a parent, and physical separation. Many children are forced to live with extended family or enter foster care. A 2015 study found 32% of affected children had behavioral problems, and 38% experienced mental health or medical problems. By failing to keep families connected our criminal justice system is failing children in our communities. Offered the chance to connect regularly, children demonstrate better health and education outcomes, and incarcerated parents have lower recidivism rates.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Far too often, children are denied the chance to connect with a parent in prison. This causes lasting damage to family relationships and communities. Family separation due to parental incarceration is not the child’s fault, and yet children suffer greatly from the impacts of incarceration. These children are more likely to grow up in poverty and to experience behavioral and emotional problems. We can work to reverse the effects of family separation for thousands of children in LA County through Beyond the Bus! Impact for this program will be measured in the number of children served, the frequency of video visits, improved attendance and performance in school, and increased access to in-person visits after the pandemic. An added benefit will be collecting accurate data on the number of children with incarcerated parents in LA County – information that is not regularly reported and could greatly improve support services to affected families.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Recent policy changes in California permit children to connect with a parent in prison through video visits. It's a gamechanger for children who sometimes go years without being able to say “I love you” to their parents. Beyond the Bus is a pioneering program that empowers children in LA County to make these precious connections on a regular basis. Beyond the Bus will establish 10 Hubs throughout LA County that provide internet connectivity, Wifi-capable tablets, and safe spaces for video visits. Hubs will be located at schools or faith-based institutions with a history of serving this community. Beyond the Bus isn't just about providing connectivity – it’s about bringing together a community of volunteers, local organizations, and people to support one of LA County’s most vulnerable populations. Children are often referred to as the “forgotten victims of the criminal justice system.” We need to go 'beyond the bus' to make sure that we do not leave these children behind. Hubs will provide food, fun activities, homework help, and access to a network of caring volunteers and professional staff. Volunteers will assist children and families in filling out forms to register for video visits, provide English language assistance, and register families for in-person visits after the pandemic. Hubs will also serve as important communication channels to inform families about policy changes, and to gather information about the number of children experiencing parental incarceration.",

With video visits now authorized, Beyond the Bus can expand family reunification services and video visits to over 80,000 LA County children, and turn GOTB’s annual program into a monthly event. The pandemic has laid bare the need to innovate new programs and services so that connection between child and parent remains constant. Beyond the Bus provides a solution that is achievable, scalable, and which directly addresses basic needs for children of incarcerated parents. To evaluate success, Hubs will collect data on the number of children served, as well as information on important impact factors like school attendance.

Critical shortages of math and science teachers compounds the problem. Districts with a majority of students of color and students living in poverty struggle to attract and retain qualified STEM educators.

We seek to provide alternate avenues for music education for students without instruments at home, ways to integrate music production technology into music education, and opportunities for students of color to express themselves through their music-making. We believe that this approach will make music education more diverse, inclusive, and equitable.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Since launching LA County’s first modern band program in 2004, Little Kids Rock has provided 4,200 PD hours to 345 teachers to bring engaging music instruction to kids. To measure our qualitative impact, we conduct classroom site visits (as current health guidelines permit), solicit teacher feedback, and require program teachers complete an annual survey on student, teacher, and school outcomes. In response to this survey, students have shared: • “My confidence grew, and I completed one of my life goals which was learning how to play the guitar.” • “I like the band because it is fun working with other kids. It's fun to get to know each other.” • “I like that it gives me an excuse to be myself in front of people.” Countless studies have shown that music education enhances students’ creative thinking, emotional development, and intellectual curiosity, among other benefits. Modern band’s collaborative, hands-on approach amplifies these benefits through student-centered instruction.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Music education must be accessible and relevant to be effective. Research shows that, even in schools that can offer music programs, 80% of students will leave as soon as it becomes an elective. Little Kids Rock first increases accessibility by addressing financial barriers to music education. In LAUSD, 72% of students qualify for free/reduced-fee lunch. When buying groceries is a challenge, getting lessons outside of school is nearly impossible, so in-school offerings are essential to providing a creative outlet to kids. We increase participation by building a curriculum that is relevant to, and as diverse as the students we serve. In LAUSD, nearly 75% of students are Latinx, meaning the majority of students are not represented by traditional music classes. By teaching today’s most popular music genres—including hip hop, Latin, and R&B, which were largely pioneered by people of color—students who feel represented by these genres get the means to express themselves and be heard.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Little Kids Rock’s modern band program prepares teachers to incorporate popular genres into their music classes by providing them with professional development, curricula, and classroom resources. Because Little Kids Rock invests directly in district teachers, modern band is offered during the school day and at no cost to all the students that teacher reaches. This highly sustainable model allows the program to grow each year as new students immediately fill the seats of recent graduates. During the 2021-2022 school year, Little Kids Rock will train and equip up to 30 new modern band teachers, to reach 3,000+ additional students. Grant funds will support up to two certification workshops for new teachers, such as our “Modern Band 101” or “Digital Songwriting and Production” series. Courses will be held online or in-person as current health guidelines allow. Los Angeles County is currently one of our largest program markets, serving approximately 16,000 students annually through the efforts of 160 teachers. LAUSD administrators facilitate the recruitment of teachers to participate in our workshops, and many LAUSD teachers have become modern band ambassadors who mentor new teachers. Workshops are open to any teacher who expresses their interest, but our district partners help us identify high-needs schools that would benefit from targeted recruitment.

It provides a platform where the next generation of entrepreneurs are more aware, conscious of corporate social responsibility, eager to give back to their communities, and accepting of differences and diverse backgrounds. The cornerstone of its offerings is the 10-month Fellowship Program. The applicants selected as fellows have already taken the first steps in their entrepreneurial journey. They have a start-up business that is less than three years old in the following industries: Arts & Entertainment, Technology, Online Retail, and Social Enterprises. Each has experienced barriers to starting or growing their business. The program provides insight and instruction in these and other areas: - Financial Literacy & Wellness - Product Development - Market Research & Business Model Design - Accounting - Human Resource Management and Organization Design - Branding & Marketing - Business Plan Writing - Funding, Pitching, and Investor Consults - Access to Venture Capital Opportunities Ideas are a dime a dozen--we invest in people, specifically male entrepreneurs of color that pursue their passions; implement and lead; create thriving teams; meet their measure; and fulfill their dreams. The world is full of ideas and businesses; we unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of BIPOC and GBTQ men of color. We invest in people, not just ideas.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "While the overall wealth of US families increased over the last 30 years, the wealth gap continues to grow for black families and other underrepresented groups. Institutionalized factors like family income, savings, and home ownership coupled with below average lending rates impact the ability of BIPOC business owners to succeed. This lack of access to investors and mentor networks costs the U.S. economy dollars and jobs—about $1.5 trillion per year. Average business development programs do not focus on—nor understand—the unique challenges faced by entrepreneurs of color. That’s why the work of Global Eye is so important. Investing in these emerging business leaders makes LA a better place because of: Closing of the wealth gap Increased employment opportunities Equitable distribution of investment capital Creation of pipelines for the next generation of entrepreneurs Increased tax base for our communities Expanding hope and success for BIPCO and GBTQ men of color",

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Despite recent progress, BIPOC, women and LGBTQ founders are underrepresented in the entrepreneur community. More than half of companies that have black owners were turned down for loans, a rate twice as high as white business owners. While men of color are 80% more likely to be entrepreneurial than their white counterparts, only 5% ever make it past the start-up phase. There’s an entire community of BIPOC and GBTQ men with world changing ideas who feel called to a life of deep purpose, alignment, and success, yet they face discouragement at every turn. The COVID crisis has only served to exacerbate these inequities with inequities in distribution of PPP loans. Global Eye imagines a world where the business ventures, ideas, companies, and inventions of these men exist and thrive. At its core, Global Eye is a community of support, mentorship, and learning to help male and non-binary entrepreneurs of color realize their deepest, most audacious visions.",

    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "East LA",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "In LA, low income communities of color have limited access to both healthy, nutritious food as well as well-resourced healthcare & alternative wellness. Lack of access to good food plagues neighborhoods throughout the Eastside of LA with preventable diseases that diminish quality of life & prematurely kill us with cancer, diabetes, & more. In addition to facing severe health disparities, our community also faces barriers to economic resources & have experienced a rise in mental health issues like depression & PTSD related to a volatile political climate. These problems aren't currently addressed with adequate financial or cultural resources. Todo Verde & People’s Yoga were founded by women of color from Eastside communities in response to intimate lived experience with the scope of these issues. Our work stems from the narratives that underlie the data: in 2015 only 53% of East LA residents lived in close proximity to a grocery store & 33% reported difficulty accessing healthcare.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Todo Verde’s work is to create lifestyle shifts within the Latinx community, guiding us towards enjoying healthier ingredients in a new way while enjoying recipes that we know & love. When our culturally-relevant plant-based dishes are introduced to new clients, we often hear them say “if I could eat this way everyday, I would go vegan!” This is the shift we are working to create through sharing affordable meals, accessible recipes & ancestral knowledge grounded in decolonizing foodways. Our culinary programs will address access to healthy food by facilitating hands-on cooking classes preparing nutritious recipes & hosting inclusive dialogues around food justice. These programs are designed to impact both everyday cooking & career development in the food industry. Our plant-based consumer packaged goods distribution will address access to healthy food & job opportunities in the community. Our initial product line includes 3 seasoning blends [carnitas, al pastor, tinga] for jackfruit, a popular plant-based meat alternative with low processing as compared to other highly processed meat alternatives on the market. Together, with People’s Yoga, we plan to create a community space in accordance with CDC guidelines. Similarly, all programming will be filmed from our studio until in-person classes can resume following CDC guidelines",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In 2020, Todo Verde published a plant-based Mexican cookbook widely recognized in the Eastside community, selling over 20,000 copies. This proves the community is ready to create more plant-based culturally relevant staples & have been missing the resources for healthier lifestyle shifts. We are working to provide knowledge & give our community the confidence to reclaim their health through the power of food. Since 2012, People’s Yoga has been on a mission to strengthen neighborhoods with access to yoga & other wellness practices. Our community centered space introduced yoga to over 10,000 residents, workers, students, & families throughout LA County. We will continue to offer the tools, resources, & practices necessary to make health a sustainable reality for the Eastside. In our 1st year, our space will open with in-person & virtual wellness programming.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Harvard Park families are unable to safely visit parks, schools and local stores because of pervasive community violence. These are fundamental activities that promote health and well-being. A local youth recently shared, “There are gangs on the part of the park, and I don’t want to get shot.” Recently, Harvard Park ranked as the fourth highest for violent crime out of 272 Los Angeles neighborhoods. With the historic rise in gun violence, residents are now even more fearful of simply playing within the park and neighborhood. Since January 2021, shootings in South Los Angeles have increased by 234% and homicides are up by 150% compared to last year. Harvard Park has a long-standing history of high crime and gang entrenchment. Yet, the neighborhood remains historically overlooked, experiencing decades of public disinvestment resulting from structural racism, and leading to the highest poverty rates in the region with 34% of residents having a median income of $20,000 or less.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In 2017, UPI conducted a community needs assessment which engaged 979 stakeholders to identify residents’ most pressing safety concerns in Harvard Park. It uncovered gun violence and gang activity as the top community issue, with only 33% of residents feeling safe being outside during the day. While the Community Safety Partnership initiative provided additional law enforcement officers, there has not been an equal investment in developing community leadership to coordinate safety strategies, nor an increase in gang intervention capacity to adequately address rising crime levels since COVID-19. To assess the effectiveness of UPI’s efforts in reducing violence and creating opportunities for play, UPI will track violence levels pre and post the program, as well as conduct additional surveys with residents to assess perceptions of safety. We expect crime and gun violence levels to decrease by at least 15% and resident perceptions of safety to increase by at least 10% over the next year.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Without a basic level of safety, play is not possible for all Los Angeles children, especially for children of color living in underserved communities experiencing disproportionate levels of violence. While families in Harvard Park have a park in their neighborhood, rising gun and gang violence levels prevent families from feeling safe enough to walk to or bike to the park, and even play within the park. As one youth describes, “the park is really nice, beautiful, but then a body will drop like nothing.” The Safe Parks Save Lives project will work to transform violence levels and reduce crime and gun violence by at least 15% over the next year. Increased safety will ensure families feel comfortable traveling to and from the park, utilizing the playgrounds, and playing on the sports fields. This initiative can serve as a model to help transform parks and communities through peacemakers and local community-based leadership development in South Los Angeles and greater Los Angeles County."

One year into the crisis, high poverty neighborhoods are still impacted by COVID-19 on a staggeringly different scale than more affluent areas. In California, families living in poverty have double the number of COVID case rates with half the number of vaccines being administered. Even before the pandemic began, these families were already living in an everyday crisis. A year later 8 million people, including 2.3 million children, have fallen into poverty for the first time in the US, and more children across Los Angeles County are relying on Baby2Baby than ever before. Prior to COVID-19, our main mode of distribution was an in-person shopping model, where thousands of social workers and authorized staff would access our headquarters to pick up essential items for the children in their programs. Due to increased safety measures, Baby2Baby implemented a delivery only method of distribution during this pandemic and stopped allowing any social workers to shop or pick up on site. As a result of this distribution mode shift, Baby2Baby has made deliveries to hundreds of organizations spanning school districts, homeless shelters, health clinics, foster care, hospitals and more.

Rather than lead children through linear, closed-ended experiences, we will design an inspiring and inviting enrichment program for them to explore according to their own interests and ideas. This challenging and highly engaging program will help PUSD and LAUSD students connect with hands-on STEAM concepts while giving them a voice and a platform to tell their stories with the tangible pieces they’ve created.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "When COVID-19 brought Los Angeles to a halt and left children learning at home for more than a year, the aforementioned inequalities in education were brought into stark relief. As it became clear that remote learning would continue into the 2020-21 schoolyear, organizations like Kidspace entered into a partnership with Season of STEM through LAUSD and the Broad Foundation to bring after-school enrichment to LAUSD elementary students. During the fall semester, students worked together with Kidspace and float builders from AES to tell the story of the “Best Day Ever,” which emphasized travel both near and far. During this spring 2021 semester, the students are working with a renowned puppeteer and Disney Imagineers to build a mechanical puppet that will be exhibited at Kidspace starting this summer. We are measuring quantitative impact – attendance, continued participation, etc. as well as qualitative impact through student, parent, and teacher testimonials.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Education inequities abound in LA County, and COVID-19 brought this crisis under a spotlight when students began virtual learning in March 2020. While Kidspace’s home, Pasadena, is renowned for scientific achievement, fabled architecture, and myriad arts and culture opportunities, it’s also a place of staggering income inequality. Pasadena has the greatest number of private schools per capita in the U.S. with 45% of the city’s children enrolled in private school. Meanwhile, 68% of Pasadena’s public school students come from economically disadvantaged households. The COVID-19 crisis exacerbated this “tale of two cities” and the gaps in parents’ ability to work from home and support online classes, internet and device access, and disparities in access to virtual enrichment programs and opportunities for creative expression. Located in the shadow of the historic Rose Bowl, Kidspace has a unique opportunity to bridge the “two Pasadenas” around a learning opportunity built on civic pride.",

K-5 students and their families will engage with Kidspace’s program team, and our partners from Artistic Entertainment Services (AES), a renowned parade float designer (and next-door neighbor to the museum), to explore the design, materials, animation, story, navigation, and build of an actual Tournament of Roses parade float. Students will engage online and onsite with a museum exhibition about float design and construction; family workshops where they can build and decorate their own float model; online videos; downloadable lesson plans and family activities; and – health guidelines permitting – field trips and family access to participate in the decoration of a float for the 2022 Rose Parade. This initiative builds on our experience over the last year working with LAUSD’s Season of STEM program to translate project-based learning for online and remote teaching using a parade float as the central project. With the return of the Rose Parade in 2022, this Kidspace learning program celebrates an event with the power to connect our community intellectually, physically, and emotionally.",

With your support, Bob Baker will offer a full roster of programming in neighborhood parks/parking lots, with each stop-over consisting of a 30-minute performance followed by an activity in which youth interact with a wide array of puppets. In the event of another safer-at-home order or lockdown, the Marionette Mobile is fully viewable in drive-by format, even from the safety of ones home and bedroom window (inspired largely by drive-by parades and graduation celebrations). Our project takes inspiration from puppet trucks throughout history, such as the “Mobile Recreation Program” implemented in New York City in the 1960s, which sought to restore morale after an escalation of Civil Rights riots. Today, research shows that puppetry has the power to increase Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) skills in children, significantly elevating confidence, self-awareness and coping skills in those who experience and interact with the art form.

As the Los Angeles community has transformed to adapt to Covid-19 regulations, so has our programing; we’ve worked tirelessly to ensure our programs are responsive to community needs, both in terms of racial equity, safety and the emotional needs of the public. This project is a step in that direction. Furthermore, it represents a much-needed opportunity to unite intergenerational audiences, giving families a new avenue to engage restless youth, as parents now spend more time on childcare than ever before. Our intended impact is to increase the social and emotional wellbeing of youth, while re-establishing the arts as an extraordinary, motivational and essential part of public life in neighborhoods that historically lack arts opportunities.",
    "Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.": "LA is the best place to CREATE",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "As we surpass a full year of social isolation, studies show that youth are experiencing higher rates of depression and anxiety than any other age group. Even upon re-entry to a pre-pandemic manner of living, research predicts that there will be long-term emotional and behavioral implications resulting from routine disruptions; family stress due to financial pressures; loss; and even more time away from classrooms, friends and social groups. For nearly a century, the Bob Baker Theater and our collection of historic marionettes have been a cornerstone in the LA arts community, as both a child’s first exposure to live theater and a vehicle through which they can understand and articulate their emotions. It’s our mission to address this new reality of heightened anxiety by providing a joyful, accessible arts experience that will help young people better communicate both their internal struggles and creative imaginings through the unifying, time-old medium of marionette puppetry.",

Qualitative data will be tracked via surveys, readily available to audience members on their mobile devices and as a print-out (in Spanish and English). Our intended outcome is for youth to report 80% or more improvement in social and emotional wellbeing. Surveys take under a minute and are designed by the Theater’s partner Hello Insight, an evaluation tool that helps youth development organizations prove impact and improve programs, with pre-built surveys, predictive analytics, and automated reports. Quantitative data will be tracked by program administrators, who will report on the following questions: 1) How many communities were served? 2) How many of those communities were in the 90th percentile of impoverished, Covid-impacted areas of Los Angeles? 3) Did the performance foster long-term engagement with arts-devoid communities?"

Bringing in our social impact network, our content will be critically curated and engaging. Great care will be taken in our research, selection, and preparation stage. Once finalized, spanning over 3 months, the kids will attend virtual group classes once a week. Between classes there will be additional activities. Each course will include a final art project, where SJL will host both in-person LA art showcases and amplify young talent via virtual platforms and social media. At the end of the program, if completed, the youth will have one of two options: be paid for their time or continue forward in the program, keeping the tools we’ve provided for them and seeking employment, internships, or formal education within the industry. If they choose to continue, we will support them through access to our network, their mentors, and industry professionals.

By utilizing beginning and end of program surveys among the kids, youth organizations, and industry mentors, we will constantly be on the pulse of how the program is doing, adjusting as needed. Success will be achieved by: number of signups; number of graduates who choose to continue; number of 17/18 year old’s who obtain internships or jobs, start their own business, or sell their work; engagement of additional corporate sponsors; engagement from industry experts involved in the program; and press and media reach. As we see all these numbers grow, surveys returned positively, and students thriving, success will be achieved.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Across LA’s underserved neighborhoods, children growing up in poverty are often exposed to extreme adversity, stress, and danger, causing early disadvantages compared to more privileged peers. Struggling to catch up or keep up, dropout rates rise and opportunities for further education and paid work decline. In addition, minority youth fall victim to systemic inequality, prejudice, and discrimination. Facing an unrelenting environment, unforgiving system, and unaccepting society, art and music offer at-risk youth rare and powerful outlets for creating positive change. These industries offer a variety of career options and provide tools for self-exploration and expression. Studies show that kids engaged in the arts are more likely to stay in school, report higher grades, be civically engaged, and overall achieve more. SJL’s art and music programs will empower at-risk youth with tools for creating their identity, on platforms to amplify local talent contributing to LA’s creative culture.",

NMI is invested in moving musical theatre beyond its Eurocentric origins to include more diverse writers and audiences. Few in the Los Angeles BIPOC community may have had the opportunity to be trained in musical theatre, and to bring their culturally relevant music and stories to the stage. For the past decade, NMI has been launching programs to diversify our pool of writers (Asian American initiatives in 2006/2016; Latinx initiative in 2007, the Deaf Community in 2016/2019; Veterans in 2020/21).

Women represent only 28% of overall employed scientists and engineers in the United States, and just 2% are Latinas. There is significant opportunity to right this unbalance as the U.S. expects to have 3.5 million vacancies in STEM jobs by 2025 and demand for workers is expected to grow faster than the overall labor market. And we know when to do so. This inequality begins early in the education pipeline and the greatest disparities are among girls of color.

All of our museums must boldly commit to rethinking what takes place in our museums, to whom our museums belong, and who the colleagues are who have the privilege of telling important stories.” The 2015 Mellon Foundation Art Museum Staff Demographic Survey found that people of color only hold 16% of museum leadership positions in the US and called for “diverse educational pipelines” to these positions to achieve “truly diverse staff and inclusive cultures.”",

Our program prepares opportunity youth for emerging new collar technology careers, which pay life sustaining wages. Research shows there is a major skill gap in the technology industry, which cannot be closed at the pace youth are graduating from college. IBM CEO created the term “new collar” jobs, which shifts the hiring paradigm from relying on resumes and experience to looking at potential and soft skills. Education for new collar jobs is in the form of industry level certifications and badges, which per research closes the income inequality gap. The unemployment rate will decrease as new collar jobs are entry level, include paid apprenticeships, free training and span across industries outside of technology. The demand is high.",

Selections are made without discrimination or bias toward ethnic, racial, national, cultural, sexual, or physical differences. All applicants must have a strong academic record and demonstrate a commitment to their community. The application requires high school transcripts, a personal statement, and written recommendations on behalf of the candidate. Awards are issued either directly to the college for tuition, or to the awardee for their school supplies, books, or general expenses such as food.

Furthermore, more than 95% of jobs created during an economic recovery have gone to workers with at least some college education, while those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind. While homeless and foster youth may wish to pursue higher education, the stark reality is they lack funds to do so.

Hundreds of young people go through the Corps experience every year. Some flourish when they leave and others are still looking for a network and support system. Our newly developed model of building partnerships with bridge employers has resulted in wonderful job placements for Corpsmembers, but some would benefit from a dedicated connection to Corps support and services. Others are looking for a way to give back and build up the next generation of Corpsmembers coming up.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "First and foremost, we intend that this continued early support will increase employment persistence rates for newly graduated Corpsmember 3 months, 6 months, and a year after leaving the Corps and growth in salary and benefits. Long-term we would like to see this network have an impact on former Corpsmembers career paths and personal and professional success. Just as those who go through a traditional college or university setting are able to access an alumni network, Corpsmembers should have that resource and benefit as well. We know anecdotally that former Corpsmembers are working and thriving in a variety of industries - higher education, city government, public utilities, public safety to name a few. With a formal alumni program we hope to create an active community of partnership, collaboration, ideation, and continued success.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We would begin by setting a goal for the percentage of newly graduated Corpsmembers who maintain contact with the Corps and take advantage of the services offered. We have recently been tracking rates of post-Corps employment persistence, college enrollment, and increased earning. We would hope to see both numbers grow with dedicated staff time and effort directed at the program. We would set a target for the number of alumni networking events, trainings, or informational sessions we would like to hold, and for the number of alumni - newly graduated and farther out for the program - we would like to engage in these sessions. Early years successes would defined through primarily quantitative measures as we get the mechanics of the program offerings going. Anecdotal reports of successes will add to our understanding of strengths and weaknesses. Eventually, annual qualitative surveys of participants will help in the design of program offerings and refine successful efforts.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "The Corps is a two phase program. Phase 1 is general work experience, case management, personal and professional development for all participants. It's a time to explore options, break down some barriers to future success, and make plans. Phase 2 offers more focused work experience, vocational training, educational opportunities, and professional development for those interested specifically in the types of conservation and community enhancement work projects we typically do. Now, we would like to launch a Phase 3 alumni services and networking program for any and all former Corpsmembers who would like to take advantage. The baseline service would be support and access to resources for all recently graduated Corpsmembers. This could include continued counseling and case management, job search support, networking, and possibly access to ongoing trainings. Often times, when Corpsmembers leave the familiarity of the Corps and the family they have grown to trust they stumble at a new job or in a new school. Alumni program staff would be available as a point of contact with bridge employers to check on progress or work out challenges the alumni is facing in being successful. From there the program can grow to provide peer-to-peer support between former Corpsmembers, ongoing professional development opportunities, and a network of camaraderie and encouragement.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "South Central Los Angeles has been hard hit by systemic racism and economic inequality, and the Covid-19 pandemic has put that in sharp relief. Our goal is to improve community health and reduce collateral damage caused by the Covid-19 crisis. A secondary goal is to expand the evidence base for our Promotora model, ensuring health and wellness for South LA residents in the near term, and increasing job opportunities and equitable pay for Promotores in the long term. Through our nationally-recognized model, Esperanza will provide support services to families in South LA. This approach is effective as it builds upon the expertise and knowledge of the very people impacted by a problem to know what is needed to create meaningful systemic change. Our Promotora training supports career wage employment in the health field and last year we connected more than 40 Promotoras to COVID-related outreach, education, and contact tracing jobs. The outreach program will serve 350 families in the project period. Over the next year we will: 1) increase access to health care services, conduct vaccine awareness and referrals, and reduce the number of patients returning to the ER for acute asthma care 2) improve community health through primary prevention measures 3) Increase access to other vital services, including mental health and tenant rights clinics We measure the project’s success by analyzing in-home health surveys, follow-up assessments, and periodic community health surveys.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In 1996 we pioneered the Promotores de Salud model, a strategy for reducing health disparities and increasing access to health services for low-income communities of color, while building a powerful cadre of community health leaders. Promotores conduct free life-saving home health assessments that provide education and resources to low-income households, and connect families to important services. Through our program’s education and environmental assessments, ER visits by clients for asthma decreased by 77% last year. This significant reduction in ER visits results in health improvements for patients and invaluable cost savings for community hospitals and clinics who are already overloaded with COVID-19 patients. Promotores provide culturally accessible health education, primary prevention, and advocacy to families and children. Esperanza has advanced city-wide and national policies on housing, habitability, code enforcement, workforce development, and asthma home visitation.",

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the ways that South Central Los Angeles communities are marginalized. Due to historic disinvestment, South LA is under-resourced in basic care, preventative, and mental health services. Over the past year, South LA families have faced rates of infection that are 40% higher than the rest of the county, and we have had higher rates of job and business losses than wealthier communities. We have seen that many residents have had to choose between foregoing work and face homelessness or continuing to work and putting their lives and loved ones at risk. This project will support Esperanza’s Promotores De Salud. It is an effort to improve community health and reduce the collateral effects of the Covid-19 pandemic due to the global economic downturn, high rates of infection, social isolation, increased slum housing conditions, and movement restriction measures that are unequally affecting people in underserved communities like South Los Angeles."

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "A SEED school addresses two key opportunities in LA. Resilient youth served by LA County need an educational model with enhanced services not currently available in traditional schools. Concurrently, LA Metro estimate more than 778,000 new jobs over the next 40 years. There are limited options for underrepresented youth to connect and prepare for the jobs. LA County provides welfare services for nearly 36,000 youth and supervises approximately 10,000 youth through the Probation Department. LA County has determined these youth could benefit from an enhanced academic model that includes educational enrichment and intensive social services to attain graduation and career. In South LA 7% of local high school students are performing at grade level in math and 25-30% are at grade level in language arts. 58% of young people in foster care graduate from high school and only 3% from college.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Project Ropa is the only nonprofit organization of its kind in Los Angeles. To reduce our carbon footprint, we work directly with manufacturers, retailers, corporations, nonprofit organizations, and individuals to stock our closet with surplus supplies that would otherwise end up in landfills or shipped overseas. We sort these items for use in our Mobile Hygiene Service - a retrofitted van that serves as a walk-in closet with neatly displayed clothing, shoes, accessories and more. This is in contrast to many other donation sites where clients must pick through piles of clothing. We take the time to get to know each client and help them find what works for them. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this means staff individually select items for clients in a socially-distant manner. Finally, we provide hygiene kits, PPE, food, and water, and we typically operate in tandem with mobile shower providers to provide the opportunity for a complete refresh. Last year, we began accepting fabric rolls in addition to overstock, discontinued and misprinted clothing from manufacturers. Beginning in 2021, we will begin upcycling the textiles, as well as fabric from clothing inappropriate for distribution, into items to sell to the public in support of our direct care services. We will use local crafters for production, and this project will provide new job opportunities for people with significant barriers to employment, including the homeless, formerly incarcerated individuals and veterans.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We envision a Los Angeles where hygiene is a human right, where all people can access clean clothes, and where excess textiles are given new life in support of our community. Our social enterprise program will help us achieve this vision in the short term by supporting our ongoing direct services and by keeping more textile waste out of our landfills and waterways. More of LA’s unhoused people will have access to clean clothing and hygiene supplies, which will help them achieve their employment and housing goals. It will also mean less risk of communicable and hygiene-related disease and improved mental well-being among Los Angeles’ unhoused residents. In the long term, our project will support a cleaner, healthier LA for all people. When we help even one person access proper hygiene, the whole community benefits. In addition, as we are able to serve more and upcycle more textiles, we will be reducing the environmental impact of textile waste in Los Angeles.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Project Ropa has seen a threefold increase in the number of people we are serving every month (800 to 2,500). Experts predict Los Angeles County will see an 86% increase in homelessness in the next two years (Economic Roundtable). We need to grow to meet this predicted increase in need for hygiene services. And, we need to use the untapped, underutilized resources already available to us to do so. Project Ropa will know we have achieved this when: - We have additional financial resources to consistently serve more people every month through our Mobile Hygiene Services and Community Partnerships compared to 2020 - We are able to recycle or upcycle more textile waste compared to 2020 - We are able to increase our Mobile Hygiene Service locations - 75% of our staff are from populations with significant barriers to employment",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Although this proposal is not for a collaborative project, partnerships and collaborations are an essential part of our work in Los Angeles. Our weekly Mobile Hygiene Service, which alternates between Echo Park and Downtown Los Angeles, works alongside mobile shower service providers Shower Stop and LA City CARE Mobile Station, as well as providers that offer hot meals and housing and employment resources. We also work with community providers who serve other Los Angeles communities to provide clothing and hygiene kits to help support their outreach programs, indirectly serving more than 12,000 people each year. Our community partners include: Community Loving, Food on Foot, Genevieve’s Garden, Lava Mae, SELAH, St. Francis Center, The Sidewalk Project, WaterDrop LA and Worthy of Love.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "More than 66,000 people are currently experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County. This number is expected to increase by 86% in 2023. People who are homeless, especially the chronically homeless (76% of LA’s homeless population), have significant barriers to finding and keeping clothing that fits and meets their needs. They often wind up wearing dirty and wet clothes for long stretches of time out of necessity, making them vulnerable to the spread of transmissible diseases. Meanwhile, an estimated 371,000 tons textiles ended up in Los Angeles landfills and waterways last year. Approximately 95% of this waste was of recyclable and reusable clothes, shoes, and other fabric. At Project Ropa, we find this situation unacceptable. We must do more to direct textile resources to those who need them and away from our precious land and water.

Our programs normalize the isolating experience of grief and provide a toolkit of healthy coping skills, helping grieving individuals and families overcome the trauma and adversity caused by the death of a loved one. As Vanessa, a 15-year-old, wrote: “My group showed me that it’s okay to feel angry, guilty, confused, etc. If I want to cry, then I can. I met new people that feel the same way I do. I’m not alone.” Volunteerism is another key facet of OUR HOUSE’s positive impact in Los Angeles. OUR HOUSE is a volunteer-driven organization, annually accounting for more than 500,000 donated hours of service. Many of our volunteers are alumni of our grief support groups.

Evaluation tools include: (1) Insights from initial pre-group appointments; (2) Psychosocial questionnaires; (3) Mandatory clinical supervision of group leaders; and (4) Insights from group activities. All grief support programs have demonstrated statistically significant impact in achieving the following outcomes. Children and teens increase their ability to name and express feelings related to their grief, learn healthy coping strategies, understand that they are not alone in their grief, and find comfort in speaking with grieving peers. Adults feel more comfortable expressing feelings about their grief, increase their ability to ask others for support, believe that they can lead a fulfilling and meaningful life without the person who died, and feel less alone after speaking with other people their age who are grieving.",

Children and teens may disengage from school, and adults from workplace and communal endeavors. Grief support is especially needed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which, in addition to causing more than 23,000 deaths in L.A. County, has complicated the grieving process by interrupting mourning rituals and isolating grievers through physical distancing. This is compounded by the explosion of recent traumatic deaths, with noted increases in drug-induced deaths, suicides, homicides, and families experiencing multiple deaths from COVID-19. Furthermore, there are few to no grief support resources for children and non-English speakers in Los Angeles, leaving high-need communities without the tools they need to overcome this adversity and thrive.",

    "summary": "Commonwealth Nursery is a public private partnership to grow climate and community resilience in Los Angeles. Located on a historic 11 acre site in Griffith Park, the nursery serves as an urban ecological laboratory and training grounds to support LA’s tree canopy equity goals, creating a more livable and resilient city for all Angelenos. Commonwealth is a catalyst to grow trees from locally-sourced seed, train the next generation of urban forest stewards, and grow the green jobs of the future.",

    "projectRanking": "Winner",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Our outcome monitoring process for this project will be twofold. First, we will maintain detailed records and data on the number of trees grown, names of species, locations and dates of seeds collected, number of saplings propagated and success rates of different propagation methods used (i.e., from purchased vs. locally-collected seed, from cuttings, etc.), number of free trees distributed to Angelenos, as well as the survival rate and overall health of our nursery specimens. Second, we will conduct an in-depth evaluation of our Green Workforce Development Program, using both qualitative feedback and quantitative indicators from our youth participants directly as well as from community partners engaged with the yearlong training program. City Plants will continue our outcome tracking and public feedback process for our Free Trees program, as well as documenting the number of volunteers participating in nursery-related events.",
    "Which of the LIVE metrics will you impact?​": "Air quality",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "With the rising threat of climate change, urban tree canopy equity in Los Angeles is more vital than ever. Due to inequitable distribution of green development in historically redlined districts of the city, wealthier LA neighborhoods enjoy vastly larger urban forests and their benefits, from shade cover and urban heat island reduction to improved air quality and mental health outcomes—an average differential of 37% canopy cover in affluent areas to 15% in formerly redlined neighborhoods. Procurement of quality native and climate-ready tree stock with which to remedy this inequity has been an ongoing issue. Additionally, the need for horticultural education and workforce development training around tree propagation, tree maintenance, and tree care is vital to the health of LA’s existing canopy and the efficacy of new city tree planting initiatives. These challenges point to a need for deeper integration of ecological restoration and climate resilience into city urban forestry programs.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Through our collaborative work at the Commonwealth Nursery, City Plants seeks to grow community resilience, biodiversity, and tree canopy equity across LA. Funds will expand nursery infrastructure to grow more climate-ready trees to distribute to Angelenos via City Plants’ and LADWP’s Free Trees Program, with priority to low canopy neighborhoods. Through regional seed collection and propagation of target species, our team will supply locally-grown plant material to public green infrastructure and ecological restoration projects. Trees grown from locally-sourced seed have been shown to be more adaptive to local conditions, just as our urban forest is most resilient when stewarded by local communities themselves. That’s why we’re partnering with the LA Conservation Corps to create a Green Workforce Development Program for at-risk young adults, alongside Recreation and Parks staff, to learn about tree and plant propagation for a climate-ready future; tree, plant, and green infrastructure installation, maintenance and monitoring; and nursery and arboriculture best management practices. Our goal is to train the next generation of urban forest stewards and grow the green jobs of the future. Given the central location and rich history of the Griffith Park nursery site and the diverse skills and expertise of our collaborative partners, our project is uniquely positioned to realize these goals. Together, we will cross-pollinate to transform LA into a more vibrant and equitable city.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The Commonwealth Nursery will serve as an example for how public private partnerships can transform LA into a more livable city. In 2022, the Nursery will have expanded to 17,220 sq ft onsite, building upon current infrastructure with additional tables, a site-wide irrigation system, seed storage fridge and propagation station. We aim to create a tree seed collection bank of 10-15 species and propagate 4,500 saplings, doubling our existing stock. City Plants will hire a consultant to create a Green Workforce Development Program to train an initial team of six LA Conservation Corps members in nursery, arboriculture, propagation, and seed stewardship, and young adults will emerge with equipped with expertise. Working directly with native tree seed will allow young adults to learn the process of propagation while creating a more equitable and resilient urban forest for all. Training young adults alongside Dept of Recreation and Parks staff will facilitate a nonprofit to city job pipeline."

We can also keep track of attendance and record participation to gather data to analyze the effectiveness of our program. Our underlying goal for these students is to ensure that they have a better understanding of the weight of their financial decisions as they leave high school and become adults. In the long-term, we will evaluate long term success with our students executing a better blueprint for their future financial and career decisions. This means that students are going to the right schools rather than to the ones that are more prestigious, accessing scholarships/grants to graduate debt-free, using their degrees when they enter the workforce, and not falling into financial distress as adults. Our city and state will prosper if students are given the chance to grow as the wealth and opportunity gaps drop.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "High school students are not effectively prepared to face the financial and career-ready obstacles that come with becoming a successful college attendee/graduate. It's critical to give our students the right information at the right time. That's why the MORE Program empowers underrepresented students and schools by providing financial literacy and career based education during school hours. The MORE Program works directly with high school students for 40 minute per lesson, once a week for 12 weeks each semester. The timeline for our MORE Program is based on the LAUSD calendar. We implement our first semester of financial literacy where we cover important topics such as taxes, loans, budgeting, insurance, etc. In the second semester, we dive into career development and expose the students to a plethora of careers in diverse sectors. Expert speakers or incredible individual volunteers come into the classroom to discuss these topics in further detail. Individuals go over real world experiences and scenarios to help bring the information to life so that students have a better understanding of what they are going to face once they graduate. During the presentation, students engage in team-based critical thinking activities to connect their own environment. The last five years we’ve run our program in after school programs and realized our program is more impactful inside the high school. Therefore, we emphasize working directly with students during school hours.",

Students who once were in our program will leave with an abundance of knowledge to make better financial decisions not only for their lives, yet for everyone around them. We see our former students returning and becoming helpful interns or volunteers for our programs' younger generations. Our program will also result in more Los Angeles students giving back to their communities, pursuing the proper degrees so they can enter the workforce right after college, less student loan debt, less individuals falling into homelessness, and lastly, but most importantly, ending the cycle of poverty which has plagued our great city. Our program will also make LA County a safer place because the students will gravitate towards legal activities because they will have the help, resources, and the incentives they need to stay away from illegal activities.",

People living within these communities are affected by certain determinant factors: Socioeconomic status, environment, and race. Having financial issues, lacking access to resources, and facing discrimination, plays a part in pre-determining the type of future the younger generation will have. These are roadblocks that hinder the true potential of high school students who easily become dropouts, criminals, unemployed, and impoverished. Although students are given the opportunity to go to school, they are not properly advised on what resources they can take advantage of to improve and excel both academically and socially. Essentially, high school students are not presented with enough options to succeed in life and we know this when around 70% of college graduates are not using their bachelor degree when they enter the workforce.",

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Most people aren’t aware that stereoscopic imaging has a very rich history that dates back to the 19th century. 3-D image creation and VR as we know it today has its earliest roots in the 1800s, dating to the very origins of photography. From the 1850s until the 1920s, stereographs were a popular form of personal entertainment, as common in Victorian culture as TV is today. Much of the appeal of stereoscopic photographs was the same as modern VR - the ability of 3-D imagery to immerse and virtually transport people to faraway places that they wouldn’t be able to visit in person. By juxtaposing popular analog stereo photos of the 1800s with digital VR technologies, this project will demonstrate that motivations for immersive experiences today are the same as in the past, and that VR techniques culturally achieve the exact same goals. This will provide a means of immersive exposure to our history, that the public would not otherwise have the opportunity to experience.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our hope is that the VR applications and content developed through this project will be of interest to other museums, archives, and libraries in Los Angeles. The finished VR applications can be made available to organizations and individuals who would like to utilize them to make their own collections available, and will invite future collaborations with the 3-D SPACE. The project will provide a roadmap to making new assets available in the same manner, and potentially spawn a publicly accessible network of digital stereoscopic images that can be shared among institutions and with the public at large.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "There is no specific collaborative partner for this project. 3-D SPACE is the singular applicant for this grant. Funds will not be disbursed to any partners. In the past, 3-D SPACE has collaborated creatively with organizations throughout the Los Angeles arts and education sectors, including the Los Angeles Central Library, Columbia Memorial Space Center, LA Filmforum, the Velaslavasay Panorama, the Echo Park Film Center, Captured Aural Phantasy Theater, Monsterpalooza, Heritage Square Museum, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the LA 3-D Club, as well as other arts and science organizations, museums, galleries, libraries, and schools.

Rivet School and Alder GSE aim to build on this great progress and contribute toward achieving parity to better mirror L.A. county’s student demographics. Nearly 90% of Rivet School’s Educator Pathway students are Black and Latinx – promoting stronger student outcomes by furthering racial diversity in LA’s classrooms. Along the way, our graduates will prove out working adults can achieve college success – contributing toward the 50 percent bachelor's degree attainment. Additionally, our pathway plays a larger role in income equality as it relates to the Gini index. First year teachers in LA earn nearly $26K more annually than non-degree holding staff like instructional aids. Our pathway disrupts the status quo by making college and economic advancement possible.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Rivet School and Alder GSE have closely partnered for over two years. Our missions and teams are aligned in every regard – from our commitments to racial equity to the high standards we set for teaching and learning. We’ve successfully worked with schools in the Bay Area to build internal teacher pipelines and want to replicate that success in LA. Alder GSE’s high touch teacher residency model enables candidates to earn their teaching credential and Master’s degree while apprenticing with an expert teacher alongside a community of peers. Currently, 96% of Alder students obtain full time teaching positions upon graduation, and they already partner with several LA-based schools.

We unlock the promise of online education through real-time 1:1 coaching, enabling students to earn a bachelor’s degree in as little as 2-3 years and, ultimately, to access untapped opportunity through increased economic mobility. Rivet School’s Educator Pathway program solves a specific problem facing non-degree holding classified school staff (like instructional aids and after school workers) that aspire to become teachers but cannot leave their full-time school-based job to enroll in college. Through partnership with schools and community organizations, we find and enroll these classified staff into our program and layer on extra support to pass state licensure exams (CBEST/CSET) and enter a high-quality credential program. Through our collaboration with Alder Graduate School of Education (Alder GSE), we support K-12 schools to build resilient internal pipelines for classified staff to become teachers in their schools. Rivet School has partnered with some of the largest school districts in California, including Stockton, Oakland, and San Francisco school districts, and this grant will support our work to expand impact in LA. Recently, we launched partnerships with a number of Los Angeles schools including the Inner City Education Foundation, STEM Prep, and Equitas Academy, recognizing this is only the beginning of our work in Los Angeles.",

In Los Angeles, these staff members tend to be people of color from the local community. At the same time, LA schools face a teacher shortage, struggling to recruit and retain teachers reflective of the racial identity of the students they serve. Research bears out the significance of same-race teachers for students of color – increasing performance on academic assessments in math and reading. The pipeline to teaching is broken: districts already employ a massive pool of homegrown prospective teachers of color — but these staff cannot advance without earning a bachelor’s degree first. By creating a more flexible, supported pathway through college and into credential training, our program taps into an overlooked population of working adults seeking opportunity. While many think of college attainment as a goal for 18-22 year olds, Rivet School's efforts significantly expand the market of potential graduates.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "With this grant, 2BCF will complete our STEAM projects adding to the 5 current Playbooks. Los Angeles teachers, students and families will have a rich resource of project-based and playful educational assets, including for students with special needs. As dedicated and innovative as our local teachers are, no one can deny that we were all caught short with the conversion to distance-learning. For special needs teachers, it was even more challenging. 2BCF believes that even when schools re-open distance learning will remain a valuable asset. With our intellectual heart grounded in standards-aligned playful learning, 2BCF is uniquely qualified to fill this need through our STEAM Guide to the Galaxy that will support all teachers, students and families, regardless of geography. Our kids can enjoy developing their STEAM skills, teachers can breathe easier, and Los Angeles will become the center of the creative in class and distance learning universe.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "When delivering curriculum to preK-12 classrooms in Los Angeles Counties, 2BCF has used pre-then-post surveys to gauge the receptivity and effectiveness of the curriculum. 2BCF will continue using that technique as we continue to develop options for the Project Playbook library. Once adapted, we will test run the special needs curriculum in one LA County school district. Our special needs consultant is working with us to design the survey which will be administered by special education teachers. We will complete that evaluation before making our special needs materials available to all. For the STEAM Carnival, we will provide a voluntary evaluation survey about the content and ease of use. We will also keep track of the Library's popularity and use by monitoring unique visits, lengths of stay and returns.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "2BCF is committed to providing high-quality, innovative educational resources to all students regardless of race, gender, income, ability status or delivery format. As such, we are continuing to build our growing online library, which we call “STEAM Guide to the Galaxy.” The library already contains five Project Playbooks that contain hundreds of standards-aligned project-based-learning activities that can be done alone, as a class, online, or by families. In response to a troubling lack of online resources for students with different learning abilities, we will be adapting each Playbook for students with special needs, and all future Playbooks will come with a special needs companion. And, since we don't believe in all work and no fun, we are adapting our 2020 Two Bit Circus Remote quiz show program to offer a playful collection of STEAM games and challenges for the whole family. Using the live streaming gameshow platform, we have developed a virtual STEAM Carnival that includes our gameshow, quizzes, classes, clown calisthenics, and more - a fully immersive online Carnival designed to replace the Science Fair. Our premise is that you get the science enthusiasts to attend a Science Fair, while everyone wants to go to a Carnival! In person or online, we will educate while entertaining and engaging students.",

When COVID-19 halted our in-school programming, we immediately pivoted to converting our Project Playbooks to virtual platforms. This experience showed us how few resources there are where teachers, students and parents can access remotely innovative curriculum-related project-based learning. When we looked into distance learning for special needs kids, we discovered even less. With distance learning, beyond adapting to learning from home, the special needs child has to learn from a voice on a computer. What we are hearing from many parents is that kids are simply opting out. Our children are falling dangerously behind in their STEAM skills. The marketplace needs resources for playful learning where these skills are developed through play both in the classroom and from home.",

One the number of graduates from each cohort. We also look at the number and quality of new entrepreneurs applying to the program, including the diversity of their tech offerings. We measure entrepreneurship maturity for each participant pre- and post-program by looking at their business growth, partnership growth, and any acquisitions/IPOs. The amount of investment in the startup founders as a whole is an important metric, including successful fundraising rates, number of new investors, and the average investment. In addition we track engagement through the number of volunteer and guest mentors, and the overall number of programs in South LA that promote entrepreneurship.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "The Plug In South LA Accelerator Program supports promising Black and Latinx early-stage tech startup founders through weekly workshops, guest speakers, and one-on-one mentorship with local industry leaders. The founders learn how to grow and sustain a successful venture. Sessions cover topics such as product development, team building, fundraising strategies, and user acquisition growth. The seasonal program runs from 12 to 20 weeks and culminates in a showcase where the founders present their companies to experts, community leaders, and prospective investors. Plug In South LA does not have an equity stake in the startups. Instead, we take a hands-on approach to workshop the founders’ challenges, helping them develop, communicate, and execute their ideas to scale up their businesses. Participating founders typically lack investor networks, meaning they haven’t received the introductions required to raise seed capital. Our program taps into a network of investors who engage in candid, productive conversations, putting the founders in a stronger position. Making the program available year-round would give significantly more local underrepresented entrepreneurs the resources to leap across the opportunity gap.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Black- and Latinx-led companies started more than a million new businesses in the U.S. over the past decade. Despite this, the opportunity gap is a chasm. Less than 2% of available venture funding reaches Black and Latinx startup founders. White startup founders are 3.4 times more likely to receive approved capital investment than their Black and Brown counterparts. A business starting strong financially can endure challenges, adapt to changes, and scale up. Startups with significant initial investment are also more likely to receive additional funding during future funding rounds. The odds are stacked against founders lacking initial investment. Four factors are critical in determining whether a small business succeeds or fails: financial resources, management capability, brand awareness, and startup capital access. The Plug In South LA Accelerator Program targets these areas for minority early-stage tech entrepreneurs, laying the groundwork for a more equitable path forward.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The Plug In South LA Accelerator Program’s first cohort of five local startup founders graduated in 2020. Founders emerged with quantifiable gains including signing paid customers, increases in online conversions, hiring employees, and raising capital. The current second cohort has eight founders. Dozens of mentors and speakers volunteer for the program. Each participating founder creates positive ripple effects in LA. Successfully offering the program year-round will scale up benefits locally: boosting existing businesses and suppliers, creating job opportunities, inspiring young innovators, and building a diverse talent pipeline for the broader tech industry in Los Angeles County. A stronger startup community in South LA provides a tangible economic boost to the region. With this grant, a year-round program will support 90 Black and Latinx early-stage founders annually, increasing the number of viable local businesses while advancing Los Angeles as a tech entrepreneurship hub.",

With the onset of COVID-19, PTN immediately recognized the need to innovate our programming to provide a continuum of care to young children isolated at home. This included transitioning the full scope of our Best We Can Be early education services to a tele-health platform as well as developing an extensive catalog of digitally accessible, free resources for families. Developed initially as an interim response to the Stay at Home order, PTN has come to fully embrace the use of technology as a valuable component of our early intervention programming and is now delivering a hybrid early intervention program model. This new model allows us to connect prospective clients to therapeutically-enriched early education content even before they are enrolled in our programs, and these virtual resources, designed by trained therapists and experienced educators, are available to the general public, providing support to even more children and families in need. PTN will use grant funding to continue this trajectory, providing educationally-enriched programming to young children throughout the County both digitally and in-person.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children be screened for delays at regular well-child visits as early intervention has been proven to advance long-term academic and economic success. However, research shows fewer than 1 in 3 children in California receive such screenings. Sadly, the pandemic has only exacerbated health, economic, and educational disparities for vulnerable populations, and many of the families we exist to serve are delaying health related services such as routine well-child visits and early intervention services because of concerns about exposure to COVID-19, cost, accessibility and access. With the current pandemic quickly becoming an educational crisis with devastating long-term implications, it is essential that PTN expand the delivery of innovative early education services that lay a foundation for life-long learning."

Through targeted ventures, including partnerships with local businesses, we have placed well-trained young people in internships and jobs that would have once been assumed to be beyond their reach. Mychal’s knows that the key to success for this population’s desire for meaningful work is often not ability or ambition but time and effort in training. Therefore, our most successful job ventures are those that Mychal’s develops and runs, allowing for one-on-one training to master job skills. Mychal’s Bakery & Coffee trains baristas and bakers to run and supply a mobile café that makes stops throughout the South Bay. Our baristas serve the public, handle money and credit cards, and operate a cash register. Bakers learn bulk production in a commercial kitchen, food packaging, and food storage and handling. The bakery also has a catering service and sells baked goods in local stores. All trainees must pass the exams for a California Food Handler card. Mychal’s Prints is a digital printing operation that produces custom stamped items like t-shirts, masks and mugs for companies, groups and events.

Of the 50 people in our young adult programs all have participated in employment-related services and increased their job readiness skills, and 39 passed their California Food Handler’s exam. We now have 28 young adults with developmental disabilities training either as bakers or baristas and another 9 trained to work with the equipment at Mychal’s Prints. Seven students have risen from trainee to employee in our own ventures, nine were employed by partner businesses in the community, and two attained paid internships at ESMoA. The success of the café, bakery, catering service, print operation, and overall program is assessed by business metrics (# served, revenue, etc.) and the number of trainees. Individual success is measured by skills mastered, tests passed, etc. as tracked by the program coordinator.",

A number of companies in LA have partnered with us in providing jobs, providing pop-up sites for our café, placing catering orders with our bakery, and buying t-shirts, hats, etc. from the print shop. A new partnership is under development through the Collaboration Center in Nevada. The Center is a disability network that partners with providers, agencies and non-profits serving those with different abilities.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Independence is one of the most valued goals for any life and for most young adults independence means employment that offers opportunities to make a productive contribution to society. But for many developmentally disabled people their education and training simply do not prepare them for employment in the community. A Cornell University survey shows only 15.7% of people with independent living disabilities have employment and a separate online survey of 5,000 people showed a similar result – only 15% of those with developmental disabilities find employment, despite the fact that more than half seek it. That obstacle has a wide-ranging effect. Those with developmental disabilities face a lifetime of dependence and the burden is on society to support them. It doesn’t have to be that way. Mychal’s Learning Place successfully promotes independent living for all our participants, including job training, experience and placement for young people transitioning into adulthood.",

LA is lauded as the land of dreams but not everyone in LA has an equal opportunity to fulfill their dreams. Recent studies show that 1 in 6 children in this country have a developmental disability yet this population faces enormous obstacles in pursuing their ambitions. The job training programs at Mychal’s Learning Place help these young people compete for employment in their community. By creating opportunities for young people with developmental disabilities to participate in and contribute to society in meaningful ways, Mychal’s is improving prospects, self-esteem and lives among the developmentally disabled population, improving LA’s economy by changing dependents into wage-earners, and improving society’s perception of an often disregarded population in our world.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "A recent survey finds the pandemic negatively impacts our long-term physical and mental health (undesired weight changes, changes in sleep patterns, delayed health care, and worsened stress and mental health). Access to nature helps us cope and heal. According to numerous experts, nature is an effective way to shake off the weight and hardships associated with stay-at-home orders and social isolation. Yet, Los Angeles communities and populations hit hardest by the pandemic are also the ones with least access to open space and parks. Only five existing transit lines serve any of Los Angeles’ mountain open space destinations; only 22% of the County lives within one-half mile of bus stops or routes that service beach parks; and it takes one hour or more for 60% of residents to get to the mountains. More than 90% of our participants (who are low-income residents) cite transportation as their greatest barrier to accessing nature. Our pandemic recovery requires equity in access to nature.",

N4A will develop and use surveys and interviews to capture both quantitative and qualitative measures of our success. The survey will measure the number of people who participated, if they had a positive or beneficial experience on their access trip, what was learned, and if they show an interest in continuing to visit natural areas. Our program’s survey results show that over 82.8% surveyed state transportation is their biggest barrier to accessing nature (second was lack of information). Supervisor Sheila Kuehl committed to providing one shuttle per year for District 3.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "All Aboard for Nature will provide a total of 10 free trips to Los Angeles’ natural areas and interpretive programming to more than 500 community members, with priority outreach to communities and populations most impacted by lack of access to natural spaces such as those living in East LA, the San Gabriel Valley, and the San Fernando Valley, many of whom will visit them for the first time. These very/high-park-need communities (defined by LAC Parks and Recreation needs assessment) are often urban, predominantly low-income, & people of color, and lack convenient and affordable transportation options. We also will focus on reaching system-impacted and frontline communities (formerly incarcerated, foster youth, factory workers, etc). Organizations serving system-impacted and frontline communities will help us with outreach. Trips will be to natural areas within 1-1 ½ hours from their homes to forests, beaches, and parks and ensure options for people of all abilities. Each trip includes a naturalist to guide the group & provide education/safety. Our materials will be available in multiple languages, and the naturalists will be bilingual. If COVID restrictions are in place, we will provide 45 trips using micro-transit vouchers or passenger vans for transportation. Families will be met at the destination by a California Naturalist using COVID guidelines to orient them to hiking trails and other natural features. Approximately 405 people will be served by these COVID-safe trips.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "A recent article in an AARP newsletter led with this statement: When your world gets small, nature lets you live large. Los Angeles will be a more healthy and equitable place to live if our work is successful. Those hardest hit by the pandemic’s physical impacts and stresses will have access to Los Angeles’ public lands to be able to connect with nature and find relief and healing from a traumatic time. They will be able to do so safely by being with their families socially distanced outdoors. They will learn about Los Angeles’ green spaces and be inspired to incorporate natural spaces into their lives and to want to learn how to advocate for increased local green space development, protection of nature, and more public transportation to the larger natural areas around Los Angeles for the future."

The startup was established by a child welfare social worker to build trust and supportive services for transition age youth. The company accomplishes this by monetizing the work of TAY artists and teaching life skills in the context of entrepreneurship. This is done in a stigma-free, trauma-informed environment. Green Pines Media partners with TAY visual artists to create, sell, and/or license products. They also partner with TAY vocalists and musicians to license their music for TV, film, video games, and commercials. All artists are provided with a modest advance to help them pay for living expenses. Artists may also draw additional funds to help with emergency housing and other necessities. After recoupment, profits and royalties are split 50/50 with the artist. Transition Age Artists is a documentary about the origins of Green Pines Media and their innovative approach to supporting creatives who have “aged-out” of the system. The film is currently in pre-production with plans for a crowdfunding campaign to cover the costs of filming. The LA2050 grant will help us expand the number of TAY artists who are involved in the film. This allows more TAY artists to reap the financial benefits of merchandising, and the creation of music that will be licensed for the film. The grant will also be used to hire a professional film editor who is willing to host TAY interns during post-production.",

If our work is successful, they can leverage this experience to launch their own projects, or secure employment in other areas. This grant will help Green Pines Media and associated companies generate revenue after the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-term: This grant will help create intellectual property that will educate viewers about the need for innovation within social services. It will also inspire others to create social enterprises to address social problems. If our work is successful, Los Angeles County will have the first full-service creative agency and production company for disconnected youth who have emancipated form the child welfare and probation systems.

Although African Americans and Hispanics only represent 32% of the population, they make up 56% of the incarcerated population. About 650,000 people are released from prison annually in the U.S., and about two-thirds of those are re-incarcerated within three years. According to the Center for American Progress, the black unemployment rate has been consistently twice that of the white unemployment rate from 1972-2019, and incarceration is a major barrier for many to get permanent and good-paying work. On the business front, small companies interested in bidding for contracts at the city, county, or state level have problems being able to scale and meet the demand of government contracts. This makes it harder for them to grow, harder for them to increase their bottom line and take advantage of the benefits and programs the Los Angeles municipality has to offer.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Re-Entry Growth Collective Initiative creates support structures to prevent recidivism and enable these men and women to find dignity in work and financial agency. Structures include: partnering with small businesses to provide skill-based education, creating job fairs, offering lessons in entrepreneurship, and partnering with other similar organizations to provide psychological and community support. The grant will also help address the economics of small businesses being able to scale by creating a database of skilled service providers. REGCI will offer job fairs, both live and virtual, where re-entry candidates can speak to small business owners in a large range of service fields. Then, once matched, the candidate will attend skill training sessions with those business owners for a specified number of days either at the job site or at a city college or community center. Once the candidate has successfully completed the training, they are entered into the database where they can be found by any of the business owners either participating or paying into the program. Since business owners will be interacting with the re-entry candidates, they will be able to witness the quality of their developing craftsmanship and also be able to connect with them personally. This not only will help remove the barrier of fear on part of the business owners, but also help the re-entry candidates bridge the gap and develop soft skills as well as salable ones to rebuild their lives.",

VTL has signed MOUs with many LA school districts towards this goal for SY 2021-22. VTL’s Screening and Examination process is: 1. VTL schedules and performs vision screenings using a Welch Allyn Spot Vision Screener, to determine which students have vision difficulties. 2. VTL’s mobile clinic comes to the school, where trained opticians and optometrists conduct eye exams for every student who fails their vision screening. 3. If a student needs glasses, he/she chooses a frame from a wide selection on the clinic. Glasses are delivered approximately 3 weeks later. 4. If a child loses/breaks their glasses within 1 year, VTL replaces them free of charge. 5. VTL returns every 2 years to provide continuity of care at schools.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "VTL addresses a problem affecting over 2 million school children nationwide, and more than 250,000 in LA County, who lack the glasses they need to see the board, read a book, study math or participate in class. 1 in 4 kids naturally need glasses. But, in underserved communities, 95% of kids who need glasses do not have them. Students with uncorrected vision problems often avoid reading, suffer headaches, and have trouble focusing in class, as 80% of learning during a child’s first 12 years is visual. They are more likely to fail a grade, less likely to read by third grade – a milestone critical to preventing dropout – and more likely to engage in delinquent behavior (70% of juvenile offenders have uncorrected vision). The issue is one of access many low-income communities have few eye doctors, families are not aware of the need for eyecare and lack transportation or other resources. VTL’s mobile clinics address this need by meeting the children where they are every day – in school.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 3,320",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "VTL provides glasses predominantly to students of color and students in need. All LA K-12 schools served by VTL have student populations where 65% or more qualify for the federal Free and Reduced Price Lunch Program. By closing a healthcare access gap for these students, VTL fosters opportunity by helping them do better in school, participate in sports, and have the self-confidence to thrive in daily life. VTL uses an evidence-based model of care, independently analyzed by researchers at the UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital and Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Center. We expect children provided glasses by VTL to have: (1) Improved Access to Care. (2) Prevention of Blindness: Students with more serious eye conditions were referred to follow-up care. (3) Academic Improvement: Students receiving glasses from VTL showed improvements in math and reading GPAs. (4) Higher Self Esteem: Group screening and exams reduced the stigma traditionally associated with wearing glasses."

GVN provides participants with great technical filmmaking skills and critical thinking tools. Our program has inspired many to become filmmakers and activists. But after hearing from them, it became clear that more long-term support was needed to set them on the path to successful careers in the film industry, as many racial, gender and socioeconomic roadblocks remain powerful barriers to entry.

Examples of repairs include but are not limited to the following: roof repair, mechanical, electrical and plumbing, accessibility modifications, weatherization upgrades, and flooring repair, all of which increase health and safety and help families continue to thrive in their homes. One of the fastest-growing age groups nationwide is 65 and older. The troubling reality is that many older adults are living in homes that are in disrepair or inadequate for their needs and are unable to access resources to make their homes livable. Our HPP provides older adults the opportunity to age in place with comfort and dignity in their home by providing repairs such as widening hallways and installing access ramps and grab bars. Because of these additions, older adults can move around safely, avoid accidents and injuries that can be exacerbated by age, illness, and impaired mobility. Habitat LA has served more than 500 households with repairs and modifications. Our field staff is all too familiar with the dangers created by leaking roofs, loose or non-existent handrails, exposed wires, and malfunctioning electrical panels, yet this is exactly what we see in many of the homes. To ensure that households can continue living in safe and stable homes for years to come, we continue to provide critical home repairs and modifications.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Habitat LA envisions a world where every person has a decent place to live. To make this vision a reality, we build and repair homes in partnership with limited-income families across Los Angeles County. Our Home Preservation Program provides low-income houseowners with crucial health, safety, and accessibility-related repairs. We are aware of the growing need amongst low-income homeowners, especially older adults, that cannot afford to complete necessary repairs to their homes. Many households with mortgages often defer vital maintenance on their homes due to high housing costs and costs of living. This increases the potential for health and safety threats for these homeowners and leads to neglected neighborhoods, and sometimes homelessness.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Repairs and modifications provided by Habitat LA will enhance safety, increase security, and provide greater self-sufficiency for homeowners throughout Los Angeles County. Not only will homeowners be provided with vital home repairs but their home values and those of their neighbors will increase, affordable housing inventory will be preserved, community connections will be made, and neighborhoods will be revitalized. Additionally, Habitat LA would provide more solar energy improvements, energy efficiency upgrades, and weatherization to communities. More households with solar energy systems would demand less energy from offsite generators, many using fossil fuels, and instead generate onsite renewable power thus reducing local sources of air pollution. Also, homes that receive energy efficiency upgrades and weatherization improvements will consume less energy from non-renewable energy sources, therefore generating less greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.",

Through surveys, households will report satisfaction with the repairs and services received and will report feeling more comfortable and secure in their home. Staff use these surveys to modify services and program rules, when necessary. Additionally, Habitat LA’s staff uses Homekeeper, a platform designed for affordable homeownership and that allows for easy tracking and maintaining interest lists, applications, services provided, surveys, and other important information.

Every day, 8-12 million pounds of food waste is taken to landfills within LA County. The presence of food waste in our landfills creates methane, a greenhouse gas emission 87 times more potent in its earth-warming abilities than carbon dioxide.

The 1,000 peers trained to better serve AAPI communities, will each carry the message of hope and recovery to at least 10 people. More than 12,500 people in overlooked AAPI communities will get support to reduce loneliness and mental health issues, grieve the losses of the pandemic, find jobs and cope with discrimination. The monthly trainings and associated website and social media will generate compassion and understanding that will reduce anti-Asian sentiment, hate crimes and violence, as well as inspiring others to replicate the project.

There has been a 150% rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and violence [CSU Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism]. Contrary to the myth of the successful “model minority,” AAPI unemployment soared from 3% to 15% [Rand Corporation]. Los Angeles AAPI are in need of emotional support, yet they are the least likely of all ethnic groups to receive mental health services, due to stigma, language barriers, poor cultural competency and the lack of AAPI mental health providers. This historic underrepresentation has been compounded by the complexity of serving diverse immigrants from more than 26 countries [Asian Americans Advancing Justice LA], as well as rapid population growth since 2000, projected to increase a further 11% by 2050 [LA Almanac].",

After participants complete the SHARE! Advanced Peer Specialist Training, a 70-hour online program which meets national requirements for certification, SHARE! will support them with job-hunting skills, networking, mentorship and further training in relationship-building, conflict resolution and peer bridging to support homeless and formerly incarcerated people. SHARE! will organize free monthly online trainings for peers and community members on the needs of AAPI communities, including unemployment, COVID-related losses, fighting mental health stigma, coping with discrimination, needs of elders, youth and parents, and more. Each participant will fold an origami crane that will be publicly displayed, and will earn a crane-shaped badge to designate them as culturally sensitive to AAPI communities. The trainings also will reach an estimated audience of 1,500 a month through a webpage and social media. SHARE! also will host a weekly online self-help support group for AAPI and allies to support community members as well as those working in the mental health system.",

For youth of color, current and former foster youth, justice-involved and/or LGBTQ youth, the challenges can be overwhelming. The creative industry field represents the 2nd largest labor sector in LA, yet minority representation within the field remains stubbornly and disproportionately low. This disparity distorts representation, silences voices, and leaves far too many talented young people on the outside, looking in. Exacerbating the current situation are the negative impacts of pandemic-related lockdowns and social distancing on youth’s mental health. As we look to a post-pandemic future it is clear that support for young people’s emotional needs is critical to their well-being.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Venice Arts’ first workshop in 1993, Venice Through Our Eyes, taught young people how to use the camera to find their voice: exploring, describing, and sharing their world through visual storytelling. Most had rarely seen their lives represented in the media and, when they did, often saw one-dimensional stories of poverty, violence, and despair. Our programs—conceived in a pre-digital era when teaching a young person how to use a camera to tell the stories of their lives was a unique and radical act—taught participants about the power of visual self-representation. As our pedagogy emphasizes the “whole child,” integrating creative/artistic, academic, and personal development, we have taken the work a step further with goals to help low-income young people succeed both in college and in the creative workspace. We hope for a Los Angeles creative industry that values the voices and contributions of all, including those marginalized by class, race, and immigration status."

It’s hard work. Our young people are often dealing with incredible challenges of their own, and our college-aged mentors are often tasked with leading difficult conversations around current events that they themselves are wrapping their heads around. These challenges are further exacerbated by COVID-19’s impact, and limited access to support systems our youth need. The coordination with schools, families, providers, and insurance can take too long, and cause a young person to give up on the process. This suite of services and team of contracted professionals will allow our staff to provide youth with the services they need, at the time they need them, with fewer barriers.

This suite of professionals will allow us to respond more quickly to youth needs, while also strengthening our capacity as leaders to support our community during challenging times. We think this strategy will be more beneficial than bringing on a single staff member because it will allow us to contract professionals with different specialties and identities that will better serve more of our youth.

This marginalization is most evident in disparate rates of graduation, incarceration, and unemployment. Distance learning has significantly exacerbated learning loss among low-income, Black, and Hispanic students. In addition, the virus has disrupted many of the supports that help vulnerable youth stay in school.

Chronic pain is a seemingly invisible ailment, caused by an overactive nervous system, which affects 35% of teens in the Los Angeles area. Pain can be disabling whether from cancer, sickle cell, Crohn’s, headaches, abdominal pain, or musculoskeletal pain. Modern science has shown that pain circuits in the brain can get “turned on” by pain and then intensify the pain because the pain circuits don’t “turn off.” Families spend considerable time going to multiple doctors for exams and tests -- paying high out-of-pocket costs -- but the child remains in pain. Pain causes isolation from peers, along with stress and sleep issues, and COVID-19 has only increased these problems. Anxiety, depression, and suicide rates in teens have escalated. Studies show that 70% of teens with significant pain will continue having that pain into adulthood.",

Using the brain in creative ways has been shown to alter the brain’s pain signals in a more lasting way than most medications. Providing online programs helps teens re-engage socially, while finding passion in creative arts. CHYP created an online platform in order to reach as many teens with chronic pain as possible -- teens whose families can’t access practitioners or afford treatments. CHYP features a unique online community -- called “CHYPchat” -- where teens with chronic pain meet through Zoom for an eight-week program. The first four sessions are structured as a psychoeducational group, guided by a lead facilitator and a peer mentor. The program covers important topics such as the mind/body connection, mental health, and stress management -- with an approach specifically built for teens -- while instilling new ways to think about their own strengths, self-care, self-expression, and strategies for finding hope. The following four sessions focus on social connectedness, teen discussions of their issues, and support for each other’s path to wellness. This provides an open forum for teens to interact and enjoy time with others virtually, from the comfort of their own homes.",

Over 35,000 foster youth live in LA County, 40% of whom end up in jail, homeless or dead within 3 years of aging out of the system. Only 55% graduated high school in 2020 (compared to a rate of 87% by their peers), less than 4% earn a college degree by age 25, and almost half are unemployed 8 years after leaving foster care. Even the most unconscionable data – 90% of youth with 5+ placements will enter the justice system, and foster youth are 3-5 times more likely to commit suicide than same-age peers – showcase the disservice done to those in the child welfare system. These figures represent LA's foster youth and who they will become without keen intervention to combat their debilitating trauma. Unaddressed, it leads to a range of psychological and emotional challenges negatively impacting their growth, life skills & coping skills.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The PSFAC was first envisioned by KITS, after serving various group homes in LA County. As KITS connected with youth who were in agencies for several years, with the uncertainty & instability of the system, and every upheaval of a new placement &/or school, it was clear; they needed real opportunities to not just prepare for aging out, but to be empowered to be self-sufficient as they did. By building industry partnerships, KITS was able to provide youth paid internships, scholarships to screenwriting programs & production jobs, preparing us for this next step. Our metrics to evaluate outcomes of the PSFAC include collecting “Wrap Recaps” from industry clients & teaching team members at the wrap of every project recording YP progress, as well as pre- & post-surveys from YPs & industry professionals to assess gains in job skills, planning, self-control, social awareness, focus & adaptability.

The PSFAC will operate 7 days a week as an innovative learning, vocational & social enterprise facility for transitional age youth to have an artistic outlet. The PSFAC is a safe place where youth have continuous access to the arts to generate content while being gainfully employed – providing a creative space to heal, create animated & live-action content, and learn the intricate details of business management, technology, film equipment, budgeting & behavior therapy – through the art of filmmaking. Clients like DCFS will hire our youth to create PSAs & other content. Industry professionals will also pay it forward by renting one or more of the 15-20 production sets to create their motion pictures, episodic shows & other media content for TV & film projects while hiring our youth, identified as young professionals [YP], to work on their projects.

But not teaching computer science to minority, immigrant and low-income students keep them behind wealthier students who’ve had the opportunity to learn it much earlier on. Engineer Factory has worked with Inglewood USD for five years. Currently NOT ONE middle or high school in the district offers computer science courses. Lack of access to computer science instruction places Inglewood students at a disadvantage when competing for employment opportunities in the 21st century.",

    "summary": "Our aim is to create an Equity Infrastructure Scorecard that aids in mapping concentrations of (in)equitable infrastructure across the city. This mapping is the first step in transforming every city engineering project into a more equitable system of support for all Angelenos. Beginning with a pilot project for three select systems the aim is to develop a process that helps agencies 1) understand and analyze existing infrastructural conditions, 2) identify gaps and needs, 3) direct resources, and 4) equalize access and distribution.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Inspired by Mayor Garcetti’s Executive Directive No. 27 and LA’s Green New Deal, Engineering hopes to spearhead a look outward, finding ways to better assess and transform our contribution to a more equitable built environment. The first step is to understand the existing condition by creating an Infrastructure Equity Scorecard, then use that knowledge to pinpoint areas of inequity through mapping, and, in the long run, work more closely with communities to build the systems that best serve their needs and bring all of LA’s infrastructure into the 21st century. Though data exists, bridging the silos between city agencies can be challenging. This project would create a team dedicated to a pilot mapping of three potentially interconnected systems -- sidewalks, stormwater, and parks and open space -- to model the scoring and mapping process for the City of LA. This Scorecard draws from existing sustainability assessment tools, which often only minimally focus on an equitable built environment, and tools and technology in development by our collaborators at Autocase. This collaborative Scorecard and Mapping would be the first step in Engineering’s objective to create a standard where every new infrastructure project is seen first through an equity lens.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "City of Los Angeles",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "An equity-first focus will impact the practice of hundreds of engineers and millions of residents across the City of LA. The Infrastructure Equity Scorecard and Mapping will initiate a conversation with all our contracting agencies and across public works, impacting billions of dollars of construction projects in all council districts. In the long range, the project will lead to more equitable distribution of resources by foregrounding a process that tracks infrastructure gains and losses and will give voice and agency to historically under-served residents. The Scorecard and Mapping are the first steps to identify a baseline of infrastructure conditions and distribution. The ultimate goal is an interactive, publicly available and adaptable mapping and assessment tool, which allows designers, engineers and residents to be proactive in the face of rising wealth disparity and climate challenges, the sum of which are exponentially disastrous.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "In the short term, the three measures of success include: 1) completion of research and gathering of data needed to fully analyze the current and historic conditions of the three systems; 2) establishing a set of metrics for the Scorecard; and 3) the completion of Infrastructure Equity Mapping to identify areas of most pressing need. Long-term successes include broad utilization of the mapping system for all five Bureau’s planning, design, and construction management activities to increase the level of infrastructure equity within Los Angeles. The mapping would also allow council districts and communities to leverage the equity mapping to procure additional resources and funding in historically under-served districts. The ultimate goal would be to have the Equity Infrastructure Scorecard and Mapping system applied across all city and county agencies. True success will come from realizing Engineering’s mission of delivering high quality services with equity in mind.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "The Bureau of Engineering invests millions of dollars each year engineering the stormwater, public parks, streets, and wastewater systems for all Angelenos, but aging infrastructure and uneven investment means that not every Angeleno has equitable access to basic infrastructure that supports a high quality of life. Too often, economically disadvantaged neighborhoods receive lower quality facilities or suffer through longer disruptions simply because, among other reasons, residents have less agency in the planning and decision-making process. The resulting landscape is uneven, yet how uneven and where that unevenness persists is not precisely known. An understanding of this uneven landscape, which requires better access to data, is the first step toward identifying need and increasing a more infrastructurally equitable city. This condition has been highlighted in the current pandemic, where access to space and connectivity in particular have favored the wealthy. It’s time to change that",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "The project is best described using three phases (research and data gathering, crafting of the policy recommendation, and visualization and modeling) that are nested under one consistent phase (community engagement and outreach). Each phase is constructed through community engagement and outreach. Phase 1: Research and Data Gathering -> Literature Reviews, Focus Groups, Interviews, Data Collection, Data Analysis Phase 2: Crafting of Policy Recommendations -> Crafting model land use, zoning, code, setbacks, etc. to understand how to achieve what constitutes a healthy community Phase 3: Visualizing and Modeling -> Geospatial Modeling, Renderings Phase 4: Produce a Final Report We believe this is the appropriate phasing of the work as the land use and zoning decisions, the implications of those decisions, and the processes that lead to these decisions are so decentralized that they end up being inaccessible to communities across Los Angeles. This would be an opportunity to try and centralize those decisions, while also modeling and visualizing those decisions and how they not only reshape the spatial environment in the direct community and the broader region.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Like many coastal counties across the nation, Los Angeles County will be significantly impacted by climate change, not only from drought and fires, but sea-level rise and flooding, as well. Simultaneously, as we think about the not so distant future we are dealing with immediate crises such as segregation, urban warming, housing and homelessness, affordability and displacement, long commutes, and lack of tree canopy and green spaces to name a few. Unfortunately, most don’t understand how to utilize land use and zoning for a county as big as Los Angeles, there is no connected network of knowledge, data, and information to understand the inner workings of the region, and how land use and zoning decisions in one community ripple across the county to another. Thus, this project asks, for the 88 cities and unincorporated L.A. that make up the county, how should land use, zoning, and code be structured to create a county where every community is considered healthy from a holistic view?",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Primary measure for success is will be determined using pre- and post-survey to measure change of attitudes and understanding of land use and zoning. 1. Success is getting people to realize that it’s not too late to solve the multitude of problems in society and the role of land use and zoning in helping to solve that 2. Success is getting people to understand the urban planning process as it relates to crafting the various land use and zoning policies in their communities, and how that then produces the spatial environments in which they live. Primary measure of success would be a complete report with an interactive map 3. Compiling a centralized way for people to understand how land use and zoning decisions interact with one another regionally. Long-term metric of success The long term metric be having land use and zoning decisions across the county in 88 cities and unincorporated Los Angeles produce healthy and climate resilient communities.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA County can become the center of a diversely impactful funding hub and the MINT100 project will be the catalyst for this change. Through the success of this project, 100 entrepreneurs of color, multiple LA County based community college students, and every person that views the video series will be a part of a shift in the culture of private investment funding allocation. The top 100 U.S. VC firms by deal activity accounted for $68 billion in funding with only 3% of that going to Black and Latinx entrepreneurs. In LA, the total funding received for all founders in the U.S. was 4.2% in comparison to 35.3% according to the 2020 study by Rate My Investor and Diversity VC. Shining a light and increasing visibility of the MINT100 entrepreneurs in LA County will increase the percentage of funding being funneled into our county in the long-term while driving local customers and supporters to the businesses in the short-term which will directly impact the economy of the county as a whole.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "For this proposed MINT100 project, we will define and measure success by the reach that the video series produces in terms of viewers as well as the dollar amount in funding access that the MINT100 entrepreneurs are connected to during the course of the project. We believe that the more individuals that view the stories of the MINT100, the more normalized it will be for people to see and expect excellence associated with entrepreneurs of color. We also believe that opening the door to as much direct funding access as possible to the MINT100 will allow them to have the opportunity to create even more impact in LA county through their businesses."

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "In 2019, only 30% of fifth graders in Los Angeles County met or exceeded the state standards for science learning, and this number was even lower for economically disadvantaged students who were African American (12%) and Hispanic (18%)*. These low proficiency levels are in part due to insufficient STEM educational resources in K-12 schools, especially Title I schools. Unfortunately, this lack of resources leads to more than just low test scores: it also largely contributes to the underrepresentation of minority groups—particularly Hispanics and African Americans—in STEM careers. As long as these underserved populations continue to be deprived of educational opportunities early in life, test scores will remain low, and students will keep believing that STEM subjects and careers are out of their reach. *“Test Results at a Glance.” California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, California Department of Education, https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/",

The Online School Program is based on the long-running School Field Trip program, so we expect it to have similar results. Our 2019 School Field Trip Program surveys revealed the following: ● 90% of respondents said the field trip was in the top 10% of field trips they have ever been on; 80% said their students were “a lot more engaged in the Observatory School Program than other field trips.” ● 82% said their students were more excited about science learning AFTER the Observatory field trip. ● 98% indicated that the program reinforced content or science skills previously emphasized in the classroom.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "A free after school performing arts program would create a space for everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. Elimination of tuition provides equal access to families at Lankershim and Colfax. At Lankershim this is imperative because many families are not able to afford the cost of any tuition. Our programs will help the region of Los Angeles to transform into one of the few places where all students have equal access to the benefits of a performing arts program. A continuing partnership with local schools would exist; offering students a safe and inclusive space to find community on campus. Village Arts holds a strict policy of color-blind casting and is inclusive of all abilities. In this environment, kids learn what they are all truly capable of and the power of working with others. By providing this accessible and valuable experience, we will help the next generation of Angelenos discover the power of community, the arts, and their unique voice.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Village Arts annually provides 12% of their students with some form of financial aid and has never turned a child away due to lack of funds. Despite this, many in our community are still unable to afford after school programs in the arts. As of 2018, 86% of Lankershim students and 25.5% of Colfax students qualify for free and reduced lunch. These inequities have only been exacerbated by COVID-19 and particularly impact BIPOC and immigrant families. Drama programs are shown to significantly improve literacy development and skills in English language arts, as well as building community and improving self-confidence. It is essential that all students have the opportunity to participate in equitable and high-caliber theater education. In order to help our most vulnerable community members rebuild, Village Arts wants to eliminate cost as a barrier to participating in our after-school programming.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "The simple and most effective solution to guarantee all students access to Village Arts fall theatre programs is to remove the barrier of cost. ALL students at both Colfax Charter and Lankershim Elementary, K-5th grade, could then participate in the rehearsals and performances of a musical. Village Arts adheres to all LA County COVID protocols and currently, LAUSD plans for full school reopening in the Fall ‘21. If infection rates rise, we are prepared to work closely with the schools to make accommodations or postpone programming. Awarded funds would underwrite the significant rental fees charged by LAUSD for the auditorium and rehearsal spaces. It is imperative that Village Arts after-school programming occurs on campus to best support all families. After school programs on campus create safe, educational spaces for children whose families need after school care or for whom transportation is a barrier. Salaries for artistic and technical staff, as well as hard material costs would also be covered by the grant. Year after year we have witnessed the benefits of our work and parents remark on our “inclusive and nurturing environment.” The process of creating a show naturally creates a bond with children, differences dissipate, and the necessity of collaboration is experienced. By extending our reach to families in need, as well as to underserved schools like Lankershim Elementary, Village Arts programs will have an even greater impact on more community members.",

    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Our partner organizations will be Colfax Charter and Lankershim Elementary School. Both principals of these institutions have signed on for proposed programming in the Fall and have spoken at length about the significant benefit of a free theater arts program at their schools. The schools have agreed to let us use their auditorium space for after school rehearsals and for the final performances. There will also be a performance during the school day presented as an assembly for all students to attend. Prior to registration, the schools will help market the program and distribute fliers to families. This will be a unique and lasting partnership, providing students with easily accessible and free theater arts education right at their school.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Village Arts has documented past success by measuring growth in annual enrollment, reach across LA and rise in social media numbers along with testimonials from participating families. In Fall 2021 Village Arts will expand its theatre program to Lankershim while continuing its work at Colfax. Outcomes for programs at both schools will be measured through pre and post surveys distributed to guardians and children. Surveys will measure the impact of programming on a student’s sense of connection to community, self-esteem, and confidence in their abilities. Similarly, the children’s surveys will allow students to self-report on their experience as a community member, cast member, and participant. Success will be defined by the number of new students reached, as well as the number of low-income families who are able to participate in Village Arts programming when cost is not a barrier.",

And just as trees need continued care to thrive, so do our communities. Our fruit tree program significantly benefits the physical health and environment of high-need communities. Distributing fruit trees connects people with nature, provides nutritious food, and engages community members to play a meaningful role in advancing climate resilience. Community members who receive fruit trees will have access to fresh fruit for years to come, resulting in improved nutrition and food security. Fruit trees also offer a much-needed connection to nature for residents who lack access to green spaces. Planting and caring for fruit trees empowers residents to become environmental stewards. Fruit trees capture carbon, clean the air and provide much-needed shade, resulting in healthier, cooler, and more climate-resilient communities.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Since launching our first fruit tree distribution in 1984, TreePeople has seen the fruits of our labor – thousands of trees have matured and are yielding fruit annually in underserved neighborhoods across LA County. Past recipients have been inspired to pay-it-forward and have held local workshops, ensuring distributed fruit trees are flourishing. We found our fruit tree distribution model works well in low-income, urban communities because it is highly localized and harnesses the power of community support, rather than costly equipment or contractors. Through LA2050 we hope to: + Distribute 2,500 5-gallon fruit trees at 10 events to low-income residents. + Educate fruit tree recipients on tree care, including watering, pruning, pest and disease identification. We will consider this program successful if the participants have fun, learn about tree care, and are inspired to steward their urban forest.",

TreePeople will distribute 5-gallon fruit trees through a series of community events. If needed, curbside delivery of fruit trees will also be performed to comply with COVID regulations. Community members register in advance to receive a fruit tree (limit one per household) and select from multiple species appropriate to the local climate and soil conditions. Typical fruit tree options include lemon, lime, kumquat, orange, nectarine, peach and plum. Prior to receiving a fruit tree, community members are provided a short workshop that covers proper planting and care practices as well as printed instructional material. All workshops and materials are provided in both English and Spanish. Fruit tree distribution events are publicized through flyers distributed at schools and community organizations as well as through social media and the TreePeople website.

Residents of these “food deserts” rely disproportionately on food from corner stores or travel to grocery stores outside of the community, which adds cost and takes time. Many in these communities struggle to get the fresh produce they need, resulting in hunger and malnutrition. In fact, an estimated 1 in 4 Angelenos face food insecurity. The same communities that lack fresh produce also face the worst environmental challenges. Pollution is high and environmental assets are low. The consequences can be severe: separation from nature is linked with mood disorders, and physical health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and asthma. Communities need a greener, shadier environment, along with access to fresh produce. Fruit trees do both: they green urban areas and provide healthy food for years to come."

When an immigrant survivor receives justice and feels safe, they have the ability to becoming more integrated into our communities.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Current programs are creating safety and justice for immigrants who are survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault, including those who have been trafficked, while working to make all government and law enforcement agencies providers of solutions rather than barriers. LACLJ provides free legal representation to help survivors secure restraining orders and favorable custody orders so they may be protected and their children be protected from violence. For sexual assault survivors, attorneys explain the criminal process, ensuring survivors feel safe to report, and then work to ensure survivors' rights are protected during the prosecution of the perpetrator. Another program at LACLJ is obtaining immigration status and ending the fear of deportation for immigrants we serve. Survivors sometimes choose not to seek justice or safety because of the fear of being deported if they do so. Our 40-year history has showed that as we serve survivors and bring justice and safety into their lives, they become more integrated into our community and those in government who are tasked with supporting them have the ability to understand them and their challenges in a higher level. As we work with survivors we see the barriers through government services and agencies meant to help them actually create barriers for them when seeking justice and safety, such as a survivor being able to file for a restraining order without having to enter any public place where the abuser may be present.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA County would be different if our work is successful because we would have more (low, income, immigrant) women taking control of their lives and their families' lives, moving beyond the oppression of abusive relationships, empowered and fully engaging in the benefits of our society by speaking up and accessing their legal rights. LA County is also different in the way survivors feel about their own individual lives, including the safety they feel, which adds hope and justice to LA County. Immigrants are much more easily integrated into our communities when they experience safety and justice. LA County will also be different in the way all government agencies serve (or don’t serve) survivors and being institutions that support survivors receiving justice and finding safety rather than being barriers to these things. A different LA County in regards to government agencies and law enforcement would mean that these powers are used to protect and support survivors.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We consistently survey those we have served to ensure levels of justice and safety after having worked with them. In 2019, 94% of exiting clients reported they knew what to do in response to threats to their safety, and 92% agreed or strongly agreed that they understood their legal rights. 71% of clients felt that they knew about services that could help them (a 54% improvement from intake), and 72% of those clients felt they were receiving enough help from those services. 89% of clients said after receiving services they felt less fear, 91% felt more confidence, 89% felt more hopeful. 89% of parents reported that they had a better relationship with their children, and there was a 63% increase in the number of parents reporting they were satisfied with their ability to co-parent. 44% of clients reported satisfaction with their financial condition after receiving services (a 200% increase over those clients at intake).",

Integration is difficult in a good situation for immigrants, let alone for ones who are survivors. LACLJ serves survivors (mostly immigrants) of domestic abuse and/or sexual assault through free legal representation and free legal support for a survivor seeking justice and safety. Survivors are underrepresented and oppressed to begin with and now have gone through trauma and have to go through this legal system on their own, without attorneys, in court with their abuser who has the right to cross examine them. In regards to government being more responsive to residents, survivors are consistently met with barriers rather than comprehensive solutions to support them being safe.",

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 62% of youth living in poverty have experienced at least one Adverse Childhood Experience (ACEs), which significantly impact a child’s development and social-emotional functioning. Studies also show poverty disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minority youth, making it a social and racial justice issue. The impact of poverty is great, leading to diminished health and decreased readiness to learn and graduate from high school for Black and Brown youth, which only grows more severe, as the low-income communities where they live are exposed to traumatic experiences associated with poor housing, food and income insecurity, limited resources, inadequate schools, and high crime and violence. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded these effects while illuminating the social disparities and systemic oppressions plaguing Black and Brown, and low-income communities, which further demonstrates the need for racial equity and social justice support.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "According to a recent survey by Hello Insight and Laureus USA, sports-based youth development (SBYD) programs, like Dodgers RBI, are highly important for youth development, as they play a significant role in growing the social, emotional learning (SEL) skills of youth. This study found a particularly strong impact between SBYD and SEL among young men of color and youth in under-resourced communities, making it clear that Dodgers RBI is more important now than ever. Research shows strong SEL skills give youth the ability to manage themselves, as they engage with the world, build and maintain relationships, and face challenges. Strong SEL skills are necessary to be successful in school, career and life. This is why we are committed to ensure sports and SEL opportunities are made accessible to low-income youth through Dodgers RBI, so they are not only healthier in the short-term, but also more confident, equipped and successful to achieve their dreams in the long-term.",

Once in the program, these groups gain access to resources that promote healthier life outcomes, including college tours and workshops, STEM education, racial equity curriculum, mental wellness support, health, dental and vision screenings, free glasses, fitness and nutrition clinics, and more. Coaches and parents/caregivers are incredible resources to promote a child's healthy development, which is why we offer coaches training and parent workshops centered around trauma-informed approaches in Dodgers RBI. Here, coaches, parents and caregivers receive training on how to create intergenerational, healing environments where youth can grow social-emotional learning (SEL) attributes, such as positive identity, discipline, and pro-social connections. Seeing racial equity, social justice support, and leadership development as critical needs of the youth we serve, Dodgers RBI also provides RISE leadership workshops for youth, coaches, and parents to empower them to be community leaders. RISE leadership workshops cover Identity, Diversity Concepts, Perspective Taking, Privilege, Sports as a Vehicle for Change, Civic Engagement, Leadership, and Goal Setting, and will help Black youth, girls, and teens in Dodgers RBI grow in critical areas of life.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "To measure success of Dodgers RBI on the social-emotional development of youth, we use pre/post-program and workshop surveys, demographic data collection, focus groups with youth, parents/guardians and coaches, and interviews with Dodgers RBI partners. LADF’s Manager of Strategy & Impact oversees data collection and analyzes assessments at the start and end of the Dodgers RBI program to determine youth’s physical and social-emotional development through sport. Evaluation from 2019 found 77% of Dodgers RBI players ages 5-8 reported an increase or maximum feeling of safety at the park and 73% reported an increase or maximum feeling of Self-Confidence. Using the Hello Insight Tool by Algorhythm, LADF also found 97% of Dodgers RBI players ages 9-18 succeeded in social-emotional learning development, gaining in at least one SEL capacity, and nearly two-thirds (65%) developed in 3 or more SEL capacities, like social connections, academic self-efficacy, and self-management, to name a few.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Up2Us Sports, Positive Coaching Alliance, and We Coach will provide parents/caregivers, coaches, and volunteers with coaches training that includes trauma-informed approaches and positive youth development strategies, so adults involved in the program are equipped to offer powerful support to Dodgers RBI players. Through RISE, Dodgers RBI participants will participate in a multi-week leadership program to be leaders in addressing racism and improving race relations. The program will cover how to break barriers, build trust and create pathways for positive communication. RISE will also help facilitate parent workshops, to discuss the power of sport to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion and to create positive change in the areas of race and equality."

The supplemental maintenance services will include: supplemental trash removal, litter abatement, graffiti removal, and pressure washing services. “A disorderly space with garbage gives the impression that people are not taking care of that place,” explains John Morton, World Bank environmental expert. “Therefore, if a neighborhood tolerates disorder, whether that means throwing trash on the ground or dirty streets, it could – hypothetically – produce an environment more conducive to crime... It is a symptom and also part of the cause.” In 2015 at Central Villa, Jamaica; a neighborhood with high crime and unemployment rates; the Jamaica Social Investment Fund cleaned streets to recover public spaces. Not only was the area cleaner but the project also helped mobilize the community, which led residents to propose new initiatives, such as the promotion of recycling, skills-development, and family support programs; which address a variety of risk factors that contribute to crime, violence and homelessness.

As the park's reputation deteriorated, so to did the facilities. Over time, MacArthur Park has become a hub for the homeless. To many Angelinos, homeless people are scary and tent encampments a threat. It is this seemingly city-wide sentiment that pushes city officials to invest in enforcement-based approaches when addressing homelessness. According to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA): “Fines and citations, encampment clearings and other municipal practices and policies that disrupt and displace people create additional barriers and setbacks for people experiencing homelessness, making it more likely that people will remain homeless even longer.” With the recent crackdown in Echo Park, it is clear that we as a city need to take a more compassionate initiative with our housing insecure Angelinos and with our parks.",

But, with a mere 2% market penetration of EVs, we have started seeing the inability of electrical Grids to power our new needs. This load will grow at 15GW per year, and the fact that renewable energy is only produced at certain times of the day, we would need 30 new fossil-fuel power plants, every year to power this load. This approach is a Grid-a-geddon in making, the failure will shut off power to our most vulnerable communities, putting lives and businesses at risk- all while causing a horrible charging experience for a prospective EV owner.",

We will measure success via two key outcome measures: 1- % of A-G eligible students who complete one of these forms by the March 2nd deadline 2- Percent of A-G non-eligible students who complete one of these forms by the end of the school year Secondary measures include: 1- Number of students who are identified and receive additional support through student-level data 2- Success of marketing and social media campaigns based on traffic, shares, likes, etc. 3- Qualitative impact of collaboration as measured by surveys of steering committee members, counselors, teachers, and stakeholders",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Pilot or new project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "This community-wide effort to achieve 100% FAFSA/CADAA completion will: -Create an engaged and energized committee of site, district, and community leaders that meets regularly and involves partners from a variety of sectors -Rely on student-level data to identify 12th graders who may need additional support completing forms and to track those who have started, submitted, and completed -Use these data to identify students who are A-G eligible and must submit by the state’s March 2nd Cal Grant deadline for four-year colleges -Build capacity of staff across the district and in community partnerships to share the skills and knowledge to implement and continue financial aid application completion assistance -Provide in-person and Zoom presentations across schools and the community in Spanish and English -Coordinate across the district to inspire healthy competition between schools through prizes and kudos focused on those with the greatest percent of students meeting key benchmarks -Use positive messaging to build excitement around financial aid goal, including a completion thermometer at the district and school sites, community-focused marketing and celebrations, etc. -Through workshops, town halls, and marketing, leverage resources provided by a grant from the federal Office of Minority Health to Day One and Young & Healthy in order to provide free tax preparation support and key information about available tax credits and financial aid forms to low-income community members",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The community served by PUSD covers Pasadena, Altadena, and Sierra Madre -- a geographical area that is wildly economically, ethnically, and culturally diverse and home to one of the largest historically Black populations in the county. Our area serves as a manageably-sized microcosm of Los Angeles County itself. Financial aid completion is a key indicator of college enrollment and success, and, in the current year and pandemic crisis, our FAFSA/CADAA completion rates lag behind those of LAUSD and the county, at 59% and 52% respectively to our 40%, according to the California Student Aid Commission. If successful, our community-wide and multi-sector effort can serve as a blueprint for others in our county. If our financial aid form completion rates can increase dramatically next year, closing the gap from 40% to nearly 100%, the practices we test can be adapted and adopted by partnering districts and improved upon by our own community efforts in the coming years.",

    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "CAP will liaison between key collaborators and CBO partnerships that support tax form completion and spread the word to our community’s most vulnerable families. CAP will serve as content experts alongside PUSD counselors and provide the bulk of dedicated staffing and curriculum development. PUSD is where the action happens. They will lead the effort on the ground, provide key data, and drive the district-wide vision for financial aid form completion. PEF will support key school site partners to spread the word about FAFSA/CADAA completion to students and families. They will ensure messaging is included in all communication about graduation, require FAFSA/CADAA completion for scholarship awards, and solicit new donors to increase the size and number of scholarships.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "A 2017 NCAN-commissioned study found that students in “higher-poverty school districts are less likely to complete the FAFSA than students in wealthier districts” and that billions in funding for eligible students is left on the table annually. These data ring true in Pasadena, where 74% of high school students are “socioeconomically disadvantaged” according to the CDE, and 86% come from racial/ethnic groups that are underrepresented in our nation’s colleges; however, only 44% of students completed one of these forms in 2019-2020. This collaborative effort will draw from proven best practices and local community initiatives to increase financial aid access and, therefore, increase college matriculation and graduation rates. In this historically Black and Latinx community, the effort to reach 100% FAFSA/Dream Act completion aims to maintain our rich, local diversity while ensuring the people who live, work, and learn here can thrive."

In the short term, we hope this project will lead to: - Greater awareness of and participation in the workings of City Council and its committees. - More Angelenos of all backgrounds participating in neighborhood councils, mutual aid groups, and other community-based volunteering initiatives. Long term, we believe that a more engaged and knowledgeable population can better push for policies that meaningfully improve life for Angelenos. Long term goals include: - Bigger, bolder, and more effective policy solutions to address our most urgent crises — developed from the ground-up with extensive community input. - More people running for office and other positions of power in their own communities. - More representative government better in tune with the needs of people on the ground, especially those who are struggling under the status quo.",

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "What happens inside City Hall has an enormous impact on our daily lives — and right now, local government is not working for most Angelenos. LA has more people living on our streets than any other city in the country, and is one of the least affordable places for housing anywhere in the world. We have some of the highest rates of poverty and income inequality, the worst air quality, and the deadliest streets. Underlying these larger problems is the fact that City Hall feels totally inaccessible to the average Angeleno. This is especially true of City Council’s 13 committees, which is where the most important policies are made. As a result, most of us are stuck reacting to policies after it’s too late to change them — if we hear about them at all. The inaccessibility of City Hall makes our problems feel insurmountable, but that’s only because most Angelenos don’t understand how local government and policymaking works, and what they can do to help make LA a better place for everyone.",

For our legislation tracking website and newsletter, which we’re calling “LA on Deck,” we’ll spotlight priority pieces of legislation that will have the biggest impact on people’s ability to live, work, and thrive. We’ll track these bills through City Council’s committees — little known entities that provide the most important opportunities for public input. In clear and interesting ways, we’ll cover what bills are important, how the proposed policies will impact people’s lives, where they’re at in the process of becoming law, and when there are opportunities for you to weigh in. Our companion podcast miniseries, “Key to the City,” will offer a unique combination of on-the-ground reporting and in-depth policy analysis. We’ll employ local journalists to do interviews and reporting, and work with our friends at LA Forward to demystify the ways that policy and local politics have created our current crises. Every episode will include specific actions that listeners can take to make a difference in their communities and ensure LA becomes a place that we are all proud to call home.",

The client is the community and we are bringing the best developers in the world to execute a people-centered plan. With the land under the control of Downtown Crenshaw Rising, the developers work to execute the community’s vision and can be required to build in the interest of the people, not simply in the interest of the profits of investors. This is an opportunity to realize community ownership, economic justice, and cultural celebration, and can also be a moment to actualize sustainable development. We think in systems, not silos. A systems-wide approach can address the Crenshaw community’s exposure to environmental hazards, heat island impacts, food deserts, lack of access to green space, and community mobility.",

When youth feel isolated or alone, they are less likely to build connections, initiate conversations, or feel comfortable expressing themselves to others. This results in youth disengagement, apathy, and a lack of confidence for them to pursue their academic, personal, and professional goals. As students in LA transition back to in-person learning, many will need tools to process through the traumas that they faced throughout this pandemic.

Expand the Food Program: Increasing the reach of food distribution by increasing the number of distribution days, creating secondary drop off locations, more food diverted from the landfill, and eventually, we hope to have a full food bank serving the surrounding communities. Diverting more food from the landfill will decrease methane emissions in the Los Angeles area. Expand the Composting Program: Expanding the composting program includes expanding the composting space, volunteerism associated with the process and distribution of compost to the community, and a community garden with an educational component for youth in the community. Add a food and agricultural after school program: The nutrition education initiative named, “Food Champ Jr.” provides socially disadvantaged, school-age children and their families with fun and engaging knowledge about food literacy, nutrition, basic healthy cooking skills, and how to build sustainable food systems in their local areas. The combination of serving healthy food while delivering hands-on education nourishes a child’s mental and physical well-being while developing lifelong healthy eating habits.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "For over 100 years, YWCA of the Harbor Area, dedicated to eliminating racism and empowering women, has provided services and programs to improve the lives of people of Los Angeles County. We have provided hope and dignity to hundreds of families in need, and in alignment with the LA2050 vision, we are poised to contribute to the citizen visions and proposed metrics. Our vision is to improve the health of the people of LA through the cycling of food and waste through a process of service, reuse, and education. We intend to do this by expanding our current food distribution program, composting leftovers, and adding an educational component via a community garden and after-school program. Over the long term, this intervention will increase access to fresh foods, decrease emissions, and increase community knowledge of the benefits of healthy foods and sustainability.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Based on the Food Insecurities Factsheet via UCLA, in many California communities, the official federal poverty measure does not reflect the true level of need. Though the living wage for basic needs varies by California county, in all cases that wage exceeds the highest allowable income for public nutrition programs such as CalFresh (UCLA Factsheet). In Los Angeles County, one in eight children do not have enough access to fresh fruit and vegetables. San Pedro and Wilmington communities currently have little to no options for weekly food banks in the area and many rely on YWCA Harbor Area for weekly food to feed their families. Furthermore, according to the USDA Food Access Resource Atlas much of the area we serve is considered low-income, and has low access to healthy food, and According to the CalEnviroscreen 3.0 results, San Pedro scored in the 97th percentile for factors that make communities most affected by many different sources of pollution.",

Pounds of compost managed weekly. # youth participating in after-school nutrition program # youth reporting increased knowledge of healthy choices. Goals: Healthy Futures will increase the number of pounds of food distributed by 100% from baseline at the beginning of the grant cycle. Healthy Futures will decrease the number of families reporting food insecurities from baseline at the beginning of the grant cycle. Healthy Futures will increase composting results by 50% from baseline at the beginning of the grant cycle. Healthy Futures will begin distributing 50% of all composting materials.

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "While there are thousands of agencies dedicated to homelessness in LA, The Center utilizes a radically different approach to solve the problem. Community Wellness programming gets results by focusing on relationships rather than transactional interactions. Daily groups provide the unhoused a safe place to re-engage with society. By reconnecting to the greater community, folks are able to pursue permanent housing. For recently housed clients, The Center offers Flourishing in Housing. This is a program unique to The Center, as there are no partner agencies supporting with housing retention in a similar capacity. Participants in this program don’t just retain their housing; they thrive in housing. They learn how to be active members of the community with a sense of purpose and belonging. In 2020, the program boasted a 90% retention rate, with over 70 participants and just one full-time staff member. With funding to continue to expand these programs, these numbers will only increase.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "On any given day, more than 125 individuals access The Center’s facility to attend groups, connect over cups of coffee, or to seek resources offered by The Center and by a dozen partner providers. While the agency hosts multiple publicly funded contracts, the privately funded Community Wellness programming is the heart of The Center, and is designed to be a resource for both the housed and unhoused community. Currently The Center’s Community Wellness programming is fully supported through private donations. The organization's biggest challenge, which was exacerbated through the pandemic, is securing unrestricted operating support for these programs. In 2020, The Center lost $500,000 in private funding. Programs that focus on wellness for unhoused clients, such as the On-Site Clinic, mail service, and wellness groups, as well as programs that focus on housing retention for those already in housing, such as Flourishing in Housing, will be the focal point of LA2050 grant funding.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "In order to fulfill the agency's mission of ending isolation and homelessness, The Center facilitates programming that assists individuals with decompressing, feeling safe, and overcoming social isolation. The goal of these groups is to re-engage individuals with years of trauma back into community life. The Center has found that when a person is immersed in safe, consistent community they are much more likely to seek case management, obtain housing, and maintain that housing. Regular programming runs the gamut from group meditation, to yoga (led by volunteer yogis from Wanderlust), art, poetry and music classes, read aloud short stories and current events, and gardening groups. On Friday’s, the agency invites only female-identifying folks to enter the facility, with the understanding that those with gendered-trauma thrive in the safety of closed community groups. In 2017, the Community Wellness Program staff launched Flourishing in Housing, which took the ethos of the Community Wellness Program and applied it specifically to people who obtained housing but who continued to seek support at The Center. With the Flourishing in Housing program, The Center utilizes an innovative model focused on housing retention. It does this by breaking isolation through engagement and encouragement, while providing job and volunteer readiness training and support. The goal of this group is to improve and maintain housing retention to ultimately break the cycle of homelessness for good.",

On any given night, there are 48,000 people living on the street and another 18,000 staying in congregate shelter facilities. Even more concerning is that these numbers are up by 13% from 2019 homeless count data. If this trend continues unbridled, by 2050 there will be upwards of 325,000 individuals experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. If The Center is awarded LA2050 grant funding, there will be less than 10,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles county by 2050. In the long-term, The Center aims to meet this goal by drastically (but sustainably!) scaling-up their unique programming model so that the housing success their clients benefit from can be experienced exponentially throughout Los Angeles. In the short-term, The Center plans to expand Wellness programming to help unhoused clients move towards housing, and to diversify Flourishing in Housing programming to keep housed clients housed.",

Impact is measured in several ways with the primary measure being number of participants who remained in stable housing upon exiting the program. Additional indicators of success include participants reporting that they learned more ways to plan for their safety and felt more hopeful about the future. These last two indicators may seem like small goals, but due to the nature of domestic violence, understanding safety planning and feeling hopeful about one’s future are critical indicators of a survivors continuing to live a life free of violence. Last year, out of the 40 participants in the Housing First Program, 17 found permanent housing and 23 received financial support to remain in stable housing. Upon exiting the program, all 40 participants remained in stable housing and avoided homelessness. 100% of participants learned more ways to plan for their safety.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "The Housing First model is built on three pillars: Survivor-Driven, Trauma-Informed Mobile Advocacy; Flexible Funding Assistance; and Community Engagement. Advocates focus on addressing the needs identified by survivors rather than on pre-determined needs promoted by agencies. Advocates are mobile and are trained in trauma-informed practice. Many survivors need not only safe and stable housing, but also temporary financial assistance. They may need assistance with issues directly related to housing or funds that are critical to housing stability. Funds are targeted to support survivors so they can rebuild their lives. Proactive engagement with housing providers, other service providers and community members changes how the community responds to domestic violence. The model acknowledges participants have different needs to secure stable housing. Low need is a one-time funding request including food, childcare, utility bill assistance and one-time emergency assistance such as car repair costs, lock changes, limited vocational costs, healthcare costs and transportation. Medium need assistance includes any items in the low need category, rental security deposit, and up to 6 months of rental assistance. High need assistance includes all aforementioned items with up to 24 months of rental assistance to provide the opportunity to build savings, increase employment readiness through vocational or educational programs, and address trauma or other mental health needs during this time.",

Over half of these unmet requests are for emergency shelter and housing, the most critical safety service for survivors and their families. Domestic violence is a leading cause of homelessness for women and children in the U.S. House of Ruth saw an 80% increase in hotline calls during the initial months of the pandemic, most callers needing to find a safe place to live.

Survivors fleeing from domestic violence should not lose their housing as a result. Too often this is a reality for families impacted by domestic violence. Implementing the Housing First model in Los Angeles County means more financial and emotional support is available to survivors and their families. It will result in less homelessness as a direct result of domestic violence and reduce the likelihood of survivors returning to an abusive relationship out of desperation. When survivors have the financial support to secure their basic needs, while having access to mental and emotional support to start to heal from their trauma, they are much more likely to continue making healthy decisions for themselves and their families. Domestic violence is more than a familial issue; it is a public health issue impacting all of us. When individuals and families thrive, our communities thrive as a result."

CE workers earn wages and pay taxes, reducing their recidivism rates and dependence on government assistance. They receive on-the-job training from supervisors with lived experience in homelessness and incarceration. And they are paired with an Employment Specialist, to support their job search throughout their transitional employment, helping to move them successfully into mainstream employment. Employment improves housing stability, increases self-esteem and sense of dignity, and creates better physical and mental health, while also setting in motion changes that have positive ripple effects on families, communities, and society."

While youth are training, their time is paid. When the training period has ended, youth can either A) continue their training, B) become employed by the lab, or C) become employed with an outside company that produces/uses animation; it is at once a training program and a company that produces real work for real studios. Adding to the viability and sustainability of this collaborative program is the fact that we have secured four major studio partners who A) have prioritized this emphasis upon providing better access to high-end entertainment career paths for youth of color and B) have agreed to both purchase the creative content that Digital Dove Lab will produce and employ graduates of the program. This program is the best way to address the employment barriers of youth of color because it assumes the best of its participants and trusts in their capacity to enter into high-level training immediately.

High concentrations of young adults who did not complete high school result in fewer employable young adults, lower average incomes, higher unemployment rates, and deepening economic disparities that regularly disproportionally affect black and brown communities. Crenshaw HS dropout rates range from 15% to 17% recently, compared to LA averages of 9% to 11%. These high rates enable existing cycles of economic disparity and unequal opportunity to continue to deepen in the community. Kamarie Brown, a special student board member of LAUSD, from Crenshaw HS, posed the question, “Will we fully commit to creating schools that function as the keys to unlock a student’s limitless potential?” Students need to see school as key to their survival and success in the real world to electrify the motivation to make it through.",

In a 3DE school, there are three national case study and three localized case study approaches to learning introduced into academic courses, while still maintaining CA core curriculum standards. Students progress through interdisciplinary critical thinking related to the real-life actual case study dilemmas that partner companies described to 3DE curriculum developers. Students’ natural, instinctive motivation to want to learn despite challenges and pressures is re-awakened. More students stay in school and experience increased opportunity of choices and equality as young adults. This grant will help fund the placement of two 3DE staff embedded at Crenshaw HS to train and support the regular public school administration and teachers in 3DE programming. It also funds the work of JA SoCal to secure community partnerships to provide local, inspirational and rigorous case study stories for the curriculum. 23 schools around the country have launched 3DE curriculum. Surveys show greater student interest in learning, including improvement of graduation rates at some schools from 62% to 92%.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "3DE educational models have significantly improved disparities in educational outcomes in other major urban communities. We believe 3DE will achieve similar success at Crenshaw HS and later at additional LA schools brought into the model. 3DE data repeatedly show increases in attendance and decreases in dropout rates. Measures of success for the 1-year grant will include increases in freshman attendance rates, as compared to other recent freshman classes, and student surveys showing high rates of student motivation, interest, and intent to stay in school, regardless of socioeconomic background. The program will expand one grade per year. In its fourth year, the full student body will be 3DE, and success will be defined by improved 4-year graduation rates, improved attendance rates, academic performance indicators and positive student and parent surveys. Long-term, 3DE will reduce dropout rates and equalize opportunities available to LA youth, helping break down entrenched inequities.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This is a pilot effort to apply this educational model to the Los Angeles area, learning from the successful launches of 3DE in 23 public schools located in Atlanta, Tampa Bay, Washington D.C. and Houston. The program has been proven successful in participating schools thus far, showing 71% outperformance in state end-of-course assessments, 92% student retention rate and 42% reduction in chronic absenteeism, and 94% four-year graduation rates. Written evaluations by students reveal that 98% of students from previously high drop-out rate schools now feel excited about their futures. At this implementation at Crenshaw HS, student attendance will be monitored and compared to prior years. As the 21-22 incoming freshmen matriculate through the grade levels to the senior year, cohort 4-year graduation rates will be assessed. Students will be offered ongoing surveys to help assess students’ experiences of 3DE and understand the benefits they describe."

While these places are essential to the cultural makeup of our city, the emphasis on well-known institutions can create an arts culture driven by status and power, rather than the people and stories behind each work of art. Providing a homogeneous representation of art in LA can make these spaces uninteresting and inaccessible to the average person, further creating barriers to underrepresented groups in the arts and entertainment industries. Arts and culture are a vital resource for inspiration, story-telling, and community participation, but our current coverage is not as representative as it could be. The Create Beat will spotlight the creators that bring unparalleled creativity to LA and tell the human stories behind our city’s incredible cultural output.",

Through our award-winning journalism, the Create Beat will create a space for artists such as the guerilla gallerists, the escape room creators, the activists using sport to change minds, uniquely SoCal street artists, and the people reinventing live music to share their craft and explore how wider societal issues play out in their creative expressions. This coverage will be a brand new short-form feature each week on our regular programming, like “Greater LA,” that brings the voices and sounds of Southern California to the world. The Create Beat aims to be the definitive source of in-depth coverage for the genius of Southern California in all of its various forms. Providing an equitable platform for visionaries to share their art will help restructure the media practices that can overlook local creators and artists. By broadening the scope of our reporting and promoting a more holistic scope of reporting to include more voices, the Create Beat will also encourage community members to engage with and participate in the arts to help diversify the arts and culture industry.",

Once established, we will foster community amongst those who visit the site, offer volunteer opportunities, sponsor remembrance rituals, connecting Angelenos who have shared experiences, and create a healing environment that provides social, emotional, and mental health support.

Our social media groups will provide a platform for spreading information about the sites, urging all who visit to join and follow for updates and community gatherings. As we are able to expand the program to locations beyond SoCal, we will be able to offer more comfort and healing to women across the country. This will hopefully lead to independent support groups with women supporting other women, thereby improving the lives and mental health of all participants.

The inability to carry a child to term often has a traumatic long-lasting impact, resulting in profound psychological suffering and stigma on women and their families. Some women have repeated failed pregnancies, causing extraordinary grief, often leading to years of mental health issues. In Western civilization, there is no place or process for this kind of mourning. However, in Japanese culture, there are public grieving grounds, presided over by the loving bodhisattva (saint) Jizo, who, according to mythology, rescues babies who died early from the underworld, and brings them to heaven, hidden in his robe. His comfort however knows no cultural boundaries",

We plan to purchase or lease a small piece of public land or existing garden, to establish the first site in the US, where we will install Jizo sculptures created by local artists, also seating and permanent signage explaining the site. There will be onsite ceremonies and rituals when allowed. The high number of miscarriages, failed IVF and stillbirths around the world is a sad and alarming fact. Based on research and medical evidence involving IVF along with pregnancies that end in miscarriage or stillbirth, around 70-75% of all conceptions end in pregnancy loss. These women suffer depression and other mental health issues, causing stress, job loss/loss of wages, family issues, even divorce. As a licensed grief counselor, and having been through the unfortunate situation herself, Patricia understands this trauma. The idea you did something to cause it, or the desperation that drives trying , despite repeated miscarriages can be devastating.There is a world-wide need for healing and solace for these victims, and our memorial sites are one way to address that anguish.Through social media we are communicating with women who are suffering, and the support within the group is very beneficial. But having a physical space to go can be even more valuable. For that reason, we plan to establish the first such site in LA County, and thereafter in locations around the country"

We learned to do more with less money and staff; however, our immunocompromised families will be forever devastated by job loss, anxiety, poverty, and isolation. During an exploding demand for service, our programs are being thought of on a continuum of care, falling somewhere between more intensive professional care and an exceptional teacher's informal support. We saw an immediate need to bring our community together virtually and exist as the hub of urgent resources and basic needs. We took action to move our communities into the Zoom space through meditation, art healing, dance parties, and mentor connections. Our goal is to aggregate the Walk With Sally’s mission through a global network in order to recruit more families and mentors, as well as serve those who wouldn’t otherwise have access.

Over the last year, the digital divide has become more apparent with the stay at home orders and the need for telehealth, telelearning and telework. These necessary connectivity points at home and in the workplace will not go away and equitable access is needed for all. A large part of the divide in digital access and adoption is the lack of knowledge around affordable broadband programs offered by internet service providers. These programs need to be highlighted and utilized.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In a fully connected Los Angeles County, equity would finally be met and the opportunity for residents of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds will finally be given equal access to the most basic needs in the digital age: the chance to have success in a job (telework), access to top level medicine (telehealth) and the ability to learn (telelearning). No longer will some have a privilege over others and no longer will barriers exist for some to not be able to participate fully in their community. The opportunity for a Global Connection is endless and the ability to engage at home seamless. The closure of the digital divide also allows for greater civic participation in the local, state and national community. Family members of all ages and backgrounds can finally have a say in the larger conversation on social and fiscal policy issues. Empowerment through voice is the strongest tool a person can have.",

Our nation faces a long overdue reckoning on systemic racism. NFTE finds hope in the fact that many in our country appear ready to face the deep-seated inequalities that have persisted for far too long and we are deeply committed to doing the work of equity. We are approaching this work through the lens of inclusive capitalism and we have seen the promise of this concept realized in young NFTE alumni who have achieved their goals of starting a business and creating jobs within their communities. By investing in their communities, these young entrepreneurs are providing sustainable opportunities that can create access to training, technical assistance, and financing. The overall impact of such examples of inclusive capitalism will help level the playing field across entire communities. NFTE is nurturing the next generation of diverse young entrepreneurs and building a world where all young people will have equitable access to economic opportunity. We believe diverse entrepreneurs can drive innovation and economic growth – and that lifts communities. When every young person can reach their full potential, families can build generational wealth, communities can thrive, and the country can build an economy that is both vibrant and inclusive.",

Some of our students are homeless or living in foster care, and for those students who do go on to college, many will be the first in their families. NFTE counters these challenges by providing students with new opportunities that give them skills, confidence, and know-how to recognize opportunities, develop talents, discover potential, and chart their own course. Entrepreneurship changes the way young people see their futures. And when that happens, they succeed personally, educationally, and professionally – and communities are stronger.

This is the greatest educational crisis of our generation. Without significant intervention, previous gains to close the opportunity gap for underserved students will slide precipitously.

Just this year, we can rescue and organize over two million pounds of food and partner with fellow nonprofits to share 1.6 million meals with disadvantaged communities. Whether it's immune-boosting citrus, veggie bacon bits, or sustainably-raised striped bass, we will connect with more large food distributors and wholesalers to develop regular donations of healthy food and increase the quality, variety, and cultural-relevance of food donated to nonprofits. Long term, the model we are developing can be replicated and customized for any community. We will help partner nonprofits develop programs in their community, ensuring that all food-insecure Angelenos have consistent, local access to meals, regardless of neighborhood, income level or emergency conditions. Ultimately, this will result in healthier, more resilient communities.",

This was accomplished with very limited storage and refrigeration capacity, which we are increasing by moving to a better-equipped facility in April 2021. While we’re proud of our numbers, the formal and informal feedback collected from nonprofit partners - forms, in-person conversations, and phone calls - signal our model is on the right track. We’ve learned that we’re providing a level of service and choice not available elsewhere, and communities are gaining access to healthy, culturally-sensitive food like never before.

Before the pandemic, 2 million people in LA County were living with food insecurity (about 1 in 5). Now, LA has the largest food-insecure population in the nation with 2.5 million people (about 1 in 4). According to the LA Food Policy Council, food insecurity is often clustered in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, which generally have 2-3 times fewer options when it comes to healthy, high-quality food. Nonprofits serving these populations have very specific needs, which are not sufficiently met through the existing food sharing systems. Attempts to solve this problem are made through technology and one-size-fits-all approaches, yet many communities remain disconnected from resources. Simply put, existing models don’t accommodate the diversity of nonprofit communities and their food needs, resulting in inequitable access to high quality food donations.",

As a kitchen ourselves, we understand the complicated nature of receiving food donations and preparing high-quality meals that meet an individual’s personal needs. Our careful nonprofit intake and feedback process, paired with our innovative food rescue inventory system, allows us to redirect resources more precisely to underrepresented communities. We emphasize quality over quantity, centralizing great food donations and efficiently dispersing them around the city, so donors can give to one place and nonprofits can better choose what they receive and when they get it. Most importantly, we layer on strong, active relationship building. We take a bottom-up approach and work with each organization to develop a deep understanding of their programs’ needs, preferences, populations served, and constraints. We have ongoing conversations, often weekly, to improve our offerings and ensure our service is responsive to changing needs in their community. With personalized knowledge of our over 80 nonprofit partners, we can match them with food that fits their community outreach and programs."

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "The problem our Marketplace Initiative addresses is the unemployment rate for adults with IDD, and more specifically, unemployment among clients in our Partial Work Community Inclusion Program (PWCIP), a program that meets Monday-Friday to help our clients live more independently. This past decade, the unemployment rate for adults with IDD in California hasn't gone below 80%, and this problem has been exacerbated by COVID-19. Most of the clients who work for our Marketplace Initiative businesses are a part of our PWCIP and don't have work outside of this program. And due to COVID, the clients in our PWCIP have been without work opportunities for a year now. Not only is the income they earn through their employment important for them to gain financial independence, their jobs fill them with pride and a strong sense of purpose and community integration. But because of the dangers posed by COVID, we also need to ensure that we create the safest possible work environment for our clients.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "We so strongly believe in employing people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) that we decided to create our Marketplace Initiative program in 2016 to employ our clients. Today, there are three different businesses in this program: The Hermosa Coffee Co., the ICAN Photo Booth, and our Etsy shop, which sells artwork and crafts created by our clients. Our goal is to provide employment opportunities for our PWCIP clients and to do everything in our power to protect them from the pandemic in the process by helping them get vaccinated, providing them with masks, and placing plastic barriers between them and the customers. This program will help us to shrink the unemployment gap that people with IDD face. Not only will we hire clients from our PWCIP directly, providing them with a job and an income, but our Marketplace Initiative also acts as a springboard to help prepare our clients for work outside of our organization. For example, if one of our clients cannot find a job at a local coffee shop, we will hire them to work at our own mobile coffee business. Once this client has been trained and gained work experience, we'll put our client in another one of our programs, the Supported Employment Program, which will then work directly with our client through the application process to find a relevant job outside of ICAN. Overall, we will help adults with IDD in the South Bay, Westside, and Long Beach by employing them and training them for future work.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our primary goal and marker of success will be if our program helps toward lowering the unemployment rate for people with IDD. If we succeed in this, which we strongly believe we will and which we had prior to the pandemic, we'll expand our organization to more areas in Los Angeles County to help people with IDD throughout the County to find and maintain employment. When our organization began in 2012, we had one client who we had provided a job for from a small space in Hermosa Beach. Now we have employed hundreds of clients throughout the South Bay, Westside, and Long Beach with four different office spaces and two large buildings in Long Beach and Torrance, which host multiple PWCIPs. Finally, we firmly believe that by lowering the unemployment rate for adults with IDD and by providing jobs for them throughout Los Angeles County, we will help to create a County with less stigmatism against people with IDD in the workforce, inspiring more local businesses to hire people with IDD.",

However, now that businesses are reopening and our clients are getting vaccinated, we are in the process of relaunching and expanding this program. We will measure the success of our Marketplace Initiative in the following ways: -The number of employment opportunities we are able to provide our clients. -The amount of clients able to get jobs outside of our organization through the work experience they received in our program. -Increased donations due to working events out in the community, which will allow us to hire more clients. -Increased awareness of our program in our communities, leading to more work for our clients. Before COVID, we were able to consistently grow our Marketplace Initiative by working events throughout our communities, allowing us to provide increasingly more job opportunities for our clients. We firmly believe this model will continue to work for us as we relaunch this program.",

In order to assess our work and ensure quality service-delivery, we ask our students to provide feedback on several key measures: food quality, enrollment, level of anxiety around hunger, motivation to stay in school, whether they feel cared for and supported, and whether the program had an impact on their lives. We also provide an open-ended question for foster youth to share how the service can be improved. The program has served over 1,300 unique foster youth across California, and based on survey responses, 89% of foster youth say that the program decreased their anxiety about where their next meal was coming from. 86% say the program helped them stay motivated to keep up with schoolwork. 95% say the program made them feel cared for and supported. And 86% say the program had a positive impact on their lives.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Meal Nation provides foster youth students with a meal a day for 30-60 days and helps foster youth access CalFresh. Our program includes 3 key components: meal delivery, meal pick-up, grocery gift cards. The program is entirely free to participants, and the average meal cost is $8.50. We work alongside our program partners Freshly, Not Impossible Labs (NIL), Rise and Guardian Scholars, college campus support programs for foster youth. Prioritizing nutritious food was important because we recognized this might be the only meal a student has access to on any given day. We partnered with Freshly to deliver healthy prepared meals weekly to youth with stable housing that lack access to transportation. Our partnership with NIL leverages technology that allows foster youth to order healthy meals from thousands of local restaurants using basic text messaging. This serves students without stable housing who may be living in their car or in a shelter. To see the model and technology, visit bit.ly/fosternil. The grocery card option provides a weekly $50 e-grocery card to students with dietary restrictions or other special needs, and we require grocery receipts before we issue a new card. We realize 30-60 days of meals will not solve food insecurity for this population, so our partnership with the nonprofit Rise provides Student Navigators who give 1:1 assistance with CalFresh enrollment to ensure our participants have a long-term solution to address hunger.",

In a virtual town hall for foster youth hosted in March 2020, by John Burton Advocates for Youth, Children’s Bureau and Think of Us, access to food was identified as the number one priority for transition-age foster youth. Due to the lockdown and campus closures across the nation, foster youth students have lost critical sources of income and access to food because students no longer have access to the on-campus jobs, meal vouchers and pantries they relied on for daily sustenance. Within the first few weeks of the lockdown, it became apparent that foster youth students were disproportionately affected by this pandemic, much more than their peers who had familial ties or support networks to turn to.",

Our intended impact is to address food insecurity in an immediate and long-term way. LA County is responsible for the welfare of foster youth – and has the largest foster youth population in the country. We all must ensure that foster youth have equitable opportunities to thrive. The impact of this program empowers LA County to remove barriers to success so that foster youth can focus on what matters most: getting an education and finding a career path in order to lead self-sufficient lives. Our program exemplifies a model of how we can support foster youth and create a healthier and more hopeful Los Angeles for people to move from just surviving to thriving – from impossible to I’m possible."

Crash reduction is measured with “Crash Modification Factors” which indicate the expected reduction in crashes for a given mitigation. The CMF clearinghouse http://www.cmfclearinghouse.org/ provides a list of over 1000 proven countermeasures that we draw from. Impact can be assessed by multiplying the current crash rate by the modification factor to estimate the statistical impact of a mitigation. 2. We conduct before/after evaluations using our video analytics to measure near misses, red-light running, speeding, and ped/bike non-compliance before and after making a change and this allows us to estimate crash reduction within weeks of a project rather than years. 3. Five years from now, the crash data will show a statistical decrease in crashes at locations where we studied and agencies took effective action.",

When the police showed up they said “no one is bleeding so we don’t need to write a police report.” What?! Overnight she went from being a marathon runner to having irreversible herniated & bulging disks in her neck and back which made it impossible to stand, walk, or sit without pain. Imagine if that was you. Last year crashes killed 631 and injured 63,740 across Los Angeles County. 248 pedestrians and cyclists lost their lives. Ultimately transportation agencies have to wait years for people to get injured and killed BEFORE there’s enough data to identify the root safety concerns, let alone solve them. Nationally 30% of crashes go unreported. Ped & Bike crashes are rare enough that even with 5 years of data there typically isn’t a pattern and when a crash happens you’re 20 times more likely to die than a vehicle occupant. No wonder more people don’t walk and bike in LA!",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "We assess pedestrian-cyclist and vehicle safety risk and thus will use total crashes for the impact analysis. The top 10 crash locations in LA all had over 15 reported injury crashes last year. At 20 locations like this, that would be ~3000 crashes over 10 years. Typically 1 in 200 crashes results in a fatality so that’s 15 people dead over 10 years at these locations. If the ratio of total fatalities to ped/bike fatalities from last year persists, 5 or 6 of those killed would be pedestrians or cyclists. We recommend potential countermeasures backed up by years of research from FHWA which in aggregate typically would reduce crashes by 80%. We work closely with each agency partner to ensure that they take action and realize these benefits. In the worst case let’s just say they implement only half of our proposed mitigations. That’s still 1200 injury crashes eliminated, 6 lives saved, and 2 or 3 pedestrians or cyclists who can live another day over the next 10 years.",

We’ve already worked at 70 intersections with 18 agencies including several in Los Angeles County: Pasadena, Arcadia, and Santa Clarita. We propose to use our analytics to study the 20 deadliest intersections across the county for pedestrians and cyclists. We use 24 hours of video taken from high-resolution temporary cameras to capture near misses, red-light running, speeding, and ped/bike non-compliance. In a single day, we capture 20 times as much risk data as you’d get from a year of crash reports. We then build detailed safety reports which outline the risk patterns we observe and provide a menu of proven mitigations that reduce crashes and save lives. The last step is to walk through the data and our safety analysis with the agencies that manage those intersections so they can take action on problems which in most cases, they weren't aware of or didn’t know how to fix. We already have a shortlist of locations extracted from TIMS, but the exact locations will depend on which agencies choose to participate."

Educational attainment matters in terms of one’s ability to earn a living wage. According to the Wall Street Journal, “workers with bachelor’s degrees or higher had nearly fully recovered jobs lost in early spring” by September 2020. There are over 1 million unfilled STEM jobs in California. Over 60% require a college degree or higher. Yet internships and jobs are highly competitive and often found through networking, referrals and family relationships. Recruiting compounds the issue. According to Harvard Business Review, “the most prestigious employers are going directly to a limited set of schools to hire new talent, systematically skewing the playing field toward students from a handful of schools…[which] has implications for corporate diversity.”",

The Washington Neighborhood is one of the only neighborhoods in Long Beach without a community center that youth can turn to. The 14th Street park needs are classified by LA County as “very high” and the infrastructure as “poor.” Gang violence is common, and the gang recruitment efforts have forced the community to respond and even walk Washington students to school. Students are forced to avoid gang territory streets and at many times approached by transient individuals on their way to school.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "The struggle of youth with incarcerated loved ones has been diminished and overlooked for too long. POPS is a proven vehicle that provides support and hope. According to program data, POPS youth are staying in school, increasing their scores on standardized tests, developing self-esteem, and becoming more future-oriented. POPS students who intended to drop out of school are graduating and going on to attend college and have turned away from substance use, traded making art for gang activity, and are embarking paths they were not able to envision before joining POPS. POPScast is designed to be an effective way for POPS to connect with and create community for those youth similarly impacted but who feel alone, while also creating visibility for this urgent issue. By giving youth an opportunity to be seen and heard, to connect with each other and inspiring role models, Los Angeles will have more high school graduates, more social support, and more productive, engaged citizens.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Guided by professional podcast producers, POPS is developing a podcast. Ten Los Angeles-based grads of the POPS the Club program, will be trained and will work under the guidance of a professional producer to develop a first season that explores teens’ experiences with the criminal justice system. Programming is modeled on POPS the Club meetings (combining mindfulness, art, mentors and conversation) and on Ear Hustle (a podcast about the realities of prisoners’ lives, before and after release, shared by those living it). The podcast will feature discussion of topics about how the criminal justice system touches LA teens’ lives, offering opportunities for artistic expression, authentic open discussion, and interviews with role models like Earlonne Woods, co-creator of Ear Hustle; Oscar-nominated comedians and social activists, the Lucas Brothers; and writer and podcaster Ashley C. Ford. During the grant period, we will develop, market and launch Season One (eight episodes), evaluate its success, and begin production for season two. The goals of this project include 1) Deepening teens’ understanding of and opportunities to share their experiences with the criminal justice system; 2) Building connection with other youth and learning about each others’ experiences; and 3) Creating awareness for the general public around the challenges these youth face as a result of family incarceration and other impacts of the criminal justice on teens’ lives.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Success for POPScast would be the project’s capacity to fulfill its goals outlined in question 8. As an early-stage project, POPS is currently exploring the most efficient and accurate ways to measure quantitative impact. POPS anticipates it will determine POPScast’s direct impact/success by Number of listeners/downloads; POPScast reviews; POPScast subscribers; Increase in POPS’ website traffic; Repurposing of POPScast content; and Future sponsorship support. Measuring indirect impact, which would include the awareness of the general public about the negative impact having a justice-involved loved one can create in the lives of children, is more challenging to measure. POPS is exploring meaningful ways to assess this impact with its evaluation team, which include experts from USC and CSUN. The most important success indicator is the meaningful impact POPScast makes for the youth creating the podcast and those who discover POPS.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Mass incarceration affects not just those convicted of crimes, but also their loved ones who experience the loss as a “shared sentence.” Stigma and trauma are part of the fabric of the lives of more than 1 in 14 children in America who endure this trauma, and in Los Angeles, estimates suggest that up to 25% of youth in economically vulnerable neighborhoods have a parent or caregiver in jail or prison. POPS the Club provides support to these youth so that they can effectively address and move past mental and emotional challenges they experience as a result of this experience. Through the use of trauma-informed, arts-based programs, POPS creates a safe, empowering space for these teens in their schools, transforming stigma and shame into hope and dignity so they can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally, now and as adults. But not all schools have a POPS club, and POPScast is designed for teens who don’t have such a space in their lives.",

    "summary": "Every day, the Natural History Museum connects eager learners to one of the most significant natural history collections in the world, sparking meaningful, lifelong relationships with science, nature, and culture. Our free field trips, Adventures in Nature camps, and other hands-on programs--both in person and virtually--resonate deeply because they engage youth directly in the work of real scientists. Access to programs like these plays a huge role in igniting student curiosity about science and the pursuit of future careers in STEM fields.",
    "goal": "LEARN",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Today, in LA County, half of all students will graduate without having reached proficiency in STEM subjects. While numerous studies suggest exposure to informal STEM learning at an early age is essential for developing a positive view of science, all too frequently extracurricular opportunities in the sciences are rare in low income communities. As a result, people of color continue to be vastly underrepresented in the sciences, both within higher education and the workforce. NHM’s goal is to close that gap. Here's how an NHM Ocean Experience Mobile Museum residency at a high school in Boyle Heights changed the lives of the teens who participated. Students were so inspired by what they experienced, and shared their phenomenal drive to learn more, that NHM subsequently created a paid Marine Science Teen Internship program especially for them. Fast forward a year and alumni of the program are now attending the University of Hawaii, UC Berkeley, among many others, as Science majors.",

    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "The museum partners with numerous school districts, community partners, non-profit organizations, and educators at over 1,200 schools across Los Angeles to meet the needs of our learning communities. With the onset of the pandemic, NHM has deepened its collaboration with LAUSD in particular, which distributes the new distance learning resources facilitated by our Museum Educators. These resources are catering to students and teachers across the other 79 school districts as well and to families learning from home across Los Angeles County. This year, NHMLAC also piloted the Teacher Advisory Council, made up of nine teachers who represent schools and districts all over Los Angeles County, to assist in curriculum development and provide direct access and perspectives regarding student needs.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "NHM education programs invite students to engage in the work of real scientists. Being able to touch and observe real fossils and historical artifacts has proven to be a powerful learning catalyst, especially for students not actively engaged by traditional classroom settings. Interacting directly with the authentic research being done by museum scientists, and seeing themselves reflected in the diverse faces of those same scientists, can be transformative. In response to the pandemic, NHM is offering a full suite of virtual learning resources to students learning from home and their teachers. Videos cover everything from LA history to mammalogy and mineral science. Large-scale webinars bring objects from “behind the scenes” for students to exclusively access. Museum Educators work one-on-one virtually with individual classrooms focused on developing critical thinking and science literacy. And “Adventures in Nature” day camps provide students in pre-K through 8th grade an opportunity to spark their curiosity and creativity. In this current moment, when the timeline for in-person field trips remains unclear, our challenge (and opportunity) is to deliver our immersive programs wherever our audiences are. We want to continue to expand our reach to students in the “virtual classroom” while also welcoming students and teachers back onsite once it is safe to do so. The only barriers are a budget stretched thin by the pandemic and Museum Educator staff already at capacity.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "NHM seeks to ensure that all young Angelenos have equitable access to science and cultural learning opportunities. In this critical moment in our region’s (and our country’s) history, and despite tremendous fiscal challenges, NHM is fulfilling a unique and important role in the educational landscape. Our Museum Educators introduce youth to the awe-inspiring wonder of the natural world. Falling in love with nature is often the first step toward a greater understanding of science, opening doors to what we hope is a life-long journey of exploration and discovery. With a grant to hire two additional Museum Educators, NHM will be able to continue to expand access to new audiences and forge connections to the natural world in students of every ethnicity, age, ability, and income level. NHM would be grateful to partner with LA 2050 and the entire Los Angeles community to ignite the next generation of scientists, nature enthusiasts, and innovators.",
    "Which of the LEARN metrics will you impact?​": "Enrollment in afterschool programs",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "NHM uses a number of assessment tools to determine learning outcomes and program effectiveness. Specifically, we track metrics related to the following four broad categories: 1) use and reach; 2) implementation and student participation; 3) outcomes and understanding achieved; and 4) quality of engagement. Outcomes vary from program to program, but these results are typical: students are more actively engaged in their learning, asking questions, raising their hand, and getting involved. Having direct contact with Museum Educators, Collections Managers, and Curators affords students a first-hand look at the fields of science, history, and museum management, awakening minds to new career paths. When students are able to engage with rare artifacts and primary resource materials their sense of awe really makes the learning “stick.” The fact that this “sticky” content delivery is seamlessly integrated with Next Generation Science Standards leads to improvement in academic achievement."

    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "To meet this challenge and opportunity, PHE is investing deeply in digital tools to promote young people’s health in innovative, scalable ways. We know that accessing students through schools is important (and we will continue to provide virtual health education workshops via our high school partners), but is also limiting in terms of reach and impact. To advance equity in access to health information, skills, and resources, it is imperative that we meet young people directly on platforms and spaces that they currently use, outside the classroom. As noted, PHE is developing an app with the objective to provide a safe virtual community for young people to access and engage with reliable health information; and to be in community with one another. The app includes features such as: • Video-based storytelling on health topics, co-created by college health educators whose identities reflect the high school aged young people we serve; • Recommended health resources based on participants’ identities and health needs; • And a safe and empowering group forum for participants to foster community and engage with one another on health topics. We will promote our app through a social media campaign, leveraging our official partnership with TikTok. Also, PHE recently finalized a partnership with Crisis Text Line that will be embedded in virtual curriculum materials, social media, and the app.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This year, it has been especially critical to understand if our virtual health workshops are having a similar level of impact on young people as our in-person programming, and we are heavily investing in formative evaluation(what do young people like/not like about the new virtual curriculum?) in addition to our summative evaluations. To date, assessment tells us there is a broader market beyond the pandemic, and we should continue to invest in virtual options. PHE previously conducted a quasi-experimental external study with the American Institute of Research(2015 and 2016). We found PHE had statistically significant positive impact on sexual and mental health, particularly on students’ help-seeking behavior. Looking ahead, we know that as we provide more virtual solutions that we have an opportunity to encourage help-seeking behaviors, direct young people to other quality health resources, and track how they are utilizing these options for care.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "East LA",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Young people in LA are facing a time of massive social upheaval, increased health risks due to the pandemic, and a mental health crisis. A June 2020 study published by the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry found that young people are more likely to experience depression and anxiety during and after quarantine's are enforced. The result of self-isolation and removal from one’s support system means they need resources for their mental health more than ever. PHE helps fill this critical gap in the provision of effective heath education and connects students to the preventative care they need across LA. If successful, young people in LA will come away from PHE with access to critical resources, increased decision-making skills, and mental health coping mechanisms which are vital to their wellbeing. With our direct-to-youth app they will also continue to have a resource for information and connect with other young people and helpful organizations.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Now more than ever, it is critical to invest in supporting the mental and physical health of young people, in support of their overall wellbeing and academic success. Young people from marginalized communities in particular, where Peer Health Exchange (PHE) offers programs, are facing heightened social, health, and economic stressors in light of COVID-19 and widened gaps in access to care. A new survey commissioned by National 4-H Council found that 7 in 10 teens are struggling with their mental health in the wake of the pandemic. More than half of those surveyed shared that the pandemic has increased their feelings of loneliness, with 64 percent believing it will have a lasting impact on their mental health. Furthermore, • 81% of teens say mental health is a significant issue for young people in the U.S. • 55% of teens say they’ve experienced anxiety, 45% excessive stress, and 43% depression. • 70% wish their school taught them more about mental health and coping mechanisms.",

As the impact of homelessness magnified, Eayikes, a collective manifesting social connection beyond physical touch, and Polo’s Pantry, a respectfully prominent mobile food pantry, joined hands. Together, we sought to address, replenish, and reallocate the displacement of resources— specifically food. Our intentions to proximate ourselves to homelessness and close gaps between them and us resulted in Home-y Made Meals.",

This downstream solution is providing hope everyday to both unhoused and housed Angelenos. Additionally, partner organizations like Covenant House California share how these meals have been integral in building trust among outreach workers and unhoused people. The power of a consistent homemade meal cannot be understated. An LA2050 grant will amplify this power, fostering deeper trust and relationship-building between outreach worker and unhoused person, while growing the hearts of housed Angelenos by transforming biases and inspiring proximity to our most vulnerable & marginalized neighbors. We work to make civic engagement joyful.",

The pandemic and resulting economic situation have also created ideal conditions for even more rapid displacement as investors search for real estate “bargains” in gentrifying areas. Corrupt landlords harass hard-working families and neglect buildings while charging exorbitant rents; activists hear stories about cockroaches in children's ears and teenagers with rat bites. The residents who created these vibrant neighborhoods are now being forced out of them. A great opportunity exists to address these inequities by leveraging public land for community-serving development, but all too often local residents are outmaneuvered by canny outsiders who know the system and can gain control of valuable public assets for their own gain.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "In the wake of the pandemic and economic downturn, some LA elected officials have voiced an interest in directing “public land for the public good” by using government owned land to build affordable housing and drive community serving economic development. This is a huge opportunity to create safe, healthy neighborhoods for downtrodden communities; thousands of lots in LA, including under-used parcels like parking lots, are owned by public entities. This use of public land could provide much needed jobs, small business opportunities, and affordable housing. To realize these opportunities, community members must show their support and fight for truly community serving development while forestalling the efforts of outside investors to seize these resources first. The UNIDAD coalition will spread awareness of this opportunity through outreach, organizing, education, and leadership development. We will focus on: 1) supporting motions by City and County elected officials to identify public land suitable for community-serving development; 2) fighting to ensure all publicly owned land in South LA is used for parks or green space or has an affordable housing requirement and 3) educating community members about a government-owned lot, formerly a beloved public library, slated to be sold to a hotel developer.

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "SankofaCity empowers GLPVCC communities to self-sufficiently co-operate and maintain Zero Emission Multimodal Transportation with support from CBOs and Mobility Providers, collaboratively offering operational oversight and technical expertise; thus providing unique local economic development, intellectual property, jobs, and skills-training opportunities that socialize innovative mobility futures and track operational best practices. Utilizing co-operative and revenue-sharing business models SankofaCity redistributes profits directly back into under-served Angeleno communities to build both individual and collective assets for the neighborhoods serviced. Most importantly, SankofaCity ZEMTE provides community stakeholders with clean mobility options that mitigate dependencies on personal transportation, improve access to local resources, facilitate employment opportunities, ease parking scarcities, minimize pedestrian fatalities, and proportionally alleviate environmental concerns.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Greater Leimert Park Village Crenshaw Corridor (GLPVCC) suffers from a lack of multimodal connectivity and shared mobility services, high incidence of pedestrian/cyclist injuries/fatalities due to vehicle collisions, cost-burdened households with above-average housing/transportation expenses, poor air quality, and low vehicle-ownership rates. Sankofacity transportation needs assessment reports, based on extensive community engagement with GLPVCC stakeholders, indicate significant gaps in the availability of affordable and safe transportation options, which residents of all ages need to access jobs, education, and other essential services. GLPVCC community stakeholders also indicated concerns regarding parking, traffic congestion, and adverse health effect due to poor air quality issues.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "The SankofaCity, ZEMTE application is based on a Community Needs Assessment formulated with extensive engagement with GLPVCC community stakeholders; desktop research on safety, infrastructure, and accessibility; and initial results of a quick-start pilot program with LACI ZEMCP. In addition to meeting the needs raised by community stakeholders and confirmed by desktop research, our proposal will also expand and extend a successful 6-month, LACI ZEMCP Leimert Park Multimodal Transportation effort. Our proposal, if successfully granted, will build on best practices from the quick-start LACI ZEMCP by extending and expanding mobility services over the next year, in parallel with recently secured 5-year grant funding. Based on LACI ZEMCP findings, the GLPVCC community is most engaged with demand-responsive shuttle service and less receptive to e-bike library rentals. Thus funding would in part be utilized to provide more than 6 times the LACI ZEMCP.weekly shuttle hours of service.",

    "summary": "Rewilder exists to convince the world that there is wealth in waste. We focus on textile waste, partnering with industrial giants to identify, divert, and upcycle waste materials that are worthy of a second life. Upcycling materials is the best end-of-life solution for the environment. The LA2050 grant will fund the expansion of our current successful operation - R+D design lab plus high-tech upcycling - into a larger facility including closed-loop textile recycling (old clothes and fabrics into quality recycled fibers).",
    "goal": "CREATE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Over 11 million tons of textiles are landfilled globally. Our entire business revolves around decreasing textile waste to landfill, and shifting the conversation about trash from where we put it, to what can we make with it? With design thinking, we can do better than landfill by upcycling and closed-loop recycling that uses existing materials rather than making new. Most of our trash heads to a landfill where it will sit for hundreds of years, all the while releasing toxins. According to the EPA, there are at least 564 operational landfills and 480 candidate sites. Since the 1960s, predominantly BIPOC communities have been targeted as sites where it has been acceptable to dump our trash. The pre-pandemic prosperity was a facade that maintained a failing system, but now, we are in a better position than ever to tackle bigger issues because it’s what the world needs. In parallel, the world will also be more receptive to what we have to offer: completely rethinking textile waste.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our Los Angeles is a leader in innovation and sustainability, a leader in technology with global influence. The pandemic, however cruel, shows the need for social capitalism. Now is the time for business to work for a greater good. Rewilder will jumpstart a sustainable textile revolution, where the robust apparel industry here has easy access to high-tech sustainable materials, plus impact data to back it up. We are committed to building a facility that reflects our company ethos of sustainability, transparency, honesty, fairness, diversity, community and good design. We are innovators - finding solutions to the world’s trash problems that incorporate both upcycling and recycling, and forward-thinking research and development that fuels innovation. Our company is woman owned and operated. Jenny is Jewish / LBGTQ, and Stephanie is Chinese-American. We are committed to making this city a better place to live and work by building a unique place that benefits people and the planet.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "When we think about waste, we always think about post-consumer. But industrial manufacturing generates massive amounts of trash: the brewery we work with tosses 2 tons of beer filter cloth every 3 days, and the auto industry trashes 100K tons of material a year. Much of it is non-recyclable and high-performance. Our work targets these industrial processes to intercept the materials before they go to the landfill, and transform them into usable raw materials for cross-industry applications. This grant will immediately support the expansion of our facility to include a larger space for rehabilitating industrial trash in order to offer these materials widely to designers and manufacturers across the country. The grant will also allow us to prioritize the new technology of closed-loop textile recycling, which complements our work and increases our impact. We are working with an expert liaison to this new material science and will be bringing in technology to shred old fabrics like t-shirts (consumer scale), uniforms, and sheets (commercial scale) and reconstruct fibers to make new fabric of equal quality. The technology will sort input fabric by color, thus reducing the need for dyeing or additional processing. We have made great progress already, and will use the LA2050 grant to propel this quickly forward. Our goal is to make a significant impact on textile waste sent to landfills in Los Angeles.",

    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 50",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We have a proven track record of high-impact material diversions with partners including Disney, PepsiCo, UCLA, Hollywood Bowl, Imperfect Foods, LA Metro, and more. For each of these projects, we measure and report the weight of the material, as well as CO2 diverted from landfills. This has a direct impact on human health and the health of the planet. With this expansion, Rewilder will: - Divert waste sent to landfill - Recapture resource value - Measure and provide clear impact metrics - Accelerate “zero waste to landfill” initiatives Beyond waste diversion, the project reduces carbon emissions in 3 ways: - Landfilling footprint – reduce CO2 from landfilling - New material footprint – reduce CO2 required to grow, create, process, and manufacture new materials - Logistics footprint – reduce CO2 used to transport Landfill reduction has a direct health impact on low-income BIPOC. Fighting against climate change is fighting against issues like social justice and inequality."

Dispelling misconceptions can improve public relations with predators and the outdoors in general and thus strengthen Angelinos’ connections to nature in their neighborhoods. Fewer conflict complaints and depredation incidents would support the recovery of cougar populations most at-risk of extinction in the short term. In the long term, we hope to identify novel tools to prevent future conflicts and establish lasting changes within state and local budgets that allocate resources to researching and managing human-wildlife interactions. Our programs targeting LA youth and Spanish speakers specifically are designed to support more diverse participation in outdoor recreation and decision-making processes occurring at neighborhood, local, and state levels.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Los Angeles is one of the last megacities left in the world that has a remaining large cat population, yet cougars in Southern California are facing an “extinction vortex” driven by genetic isolation due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by roads and development. Hundreds of cougars a year are lost statewide to human-caused mortalities including vehicle strikes, rodenticide poisoning, and depredation despite warnings from scientists about the potential loss of cougar populations in this region within 50 years if nothing is done to improve their habitat and public perception. Our mission is to connect Angelinos with resources they need to coexist with wildlife and ensure cougars have a future in LA. Angelinos love cougars and show their appreciation for wildlife annually when we celebrate P-22 Day to honor the iconic cougar of Griffith Park. People have coexisted with cougars for the last 40,000 years and this relationship has been critical for ecological and cultural integrity.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "The Cougar Conservancy will work to promote human-wildlife coexistence by connecting 15,000 LA residents to ecologically sound, geographically specific, and culturally sensitive educational programming. We seek funding to achieve the following outcomes during the 1-year project period: -Recruit and train 100 volunteers to connect their family, friends, and neighbors to our coexistence resources. Research has shown that human-wildlife conflicts can be prevented or resolved by providing communities with sound information delivered by community members. -Provide educational programming virtually and in-person (COVID limitations) to more than 8,000 people on coexisting with our wild neighbors. We will develop both youth and bilingual (Spanish) outreach programs and organize monthly events. We will hold demonstrations on how to build secure enclosures in 4 separate locations in communities along the urban-wildland interface within LA County. -Respond to reports and mitigate conflict with our Conflict Task Force as needed. Less depredation permits will be issued when our science-based consultations help reduce the number of depredated pets and livestock. -Create a video series to increase public participation in wildlife decision-making. This media project will increase general understanding of the process, relay the importance of public participation, and encourage the building of diverse coalitions of participants to ensure decisions affecting wildlife are made equitably.",

Currently, only 40% of these students have access to art programs while well-served schools report 60% of students having access. “A growing body of evidence suggests that at virtually every stage of life, the arts can foster openness to novelty, encourage connections to people, places, things, and concepts, and promote the ability to take multiple perspectives, among other positive outcomes (National Endowment for the Arts, 2011)”. This makes art a powerful, but often missing, tool for supporting vulnerable students in the classroom, especially students from communities who face exacerbated stress and trauma in their daily lives.",

In the evidence reviewed, the arts were linked with positive impacts for children from low-SES families.” Crayon Collection is committed to bringing art access to students in traditionally vulnerable communities. Our Crayon Recycling program is an easy to implement solution that helps to close funding gaps Title 1 schools and Head Start centers face that prevent them from providing students with the materials they need to create art. Utilizing community volunteers of all ages, we are able to redirect thousands of crayons that would have otherwise been thrown away into the hands of students who, in many cases, have never had crayons of their own. Our commitment to connecting donors with schools within 5 miles of the donation site ensures that our volunteers are supporting their neighbors directly, strengthening their community connection. We provide students with art lessons created by professional artists exhibited in major museums, such as the LACMA, MoMA and the Whitney Museum. Through these lesson plans we use art as a tool to encourage students to collaborate and support their peers, embrace new ideas and process their emotions.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Of the 3,007 counties in the county, LA has the worst housing affordability, overcrowding, and unsheltered homelessness, and the pandemic has only made this more acute. Rampant racial segregation and real estate speculation are pushing lower-income Black and Brown families out of their homes and communities at an alarming rate. Compounding these challenges are the recent failures of our housing market. From 2008-2018 the Metro LA Area lost 200,000 units that rented for less than $1,000/month and replaced them with 500,000+ units that rent for more than $1,500/month. In a region that is defined by low-wage service sector jobs, this is devastating. Through a painful mix of bad tax policies, exclusionary housing preferences, and short-sighted thinking we have collectively allowed our housing infrastructure to atrophy and teeter on the brink of collapse, while at the same time not investing the resources and services our Black and Brown communities deserve.",

It consists of 50+ local organizations, including 22 who are working as a steering committee to coordinate action and advocacy that: 1 Helps people stay in their current homes: Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of losing their homes, with little notice or support. Our Future’s early priorities include fully funding a countywide right to counsel, support for renters at risk of losing their homes, and Ellis Act reform 2 Creates more affordable homes: We must allow the speedy construction of homes near mass transit and jobs, affordable to people at all income levels, without displacing existing renters or segregating our population. 3 Ensures every community is resource-rich: People should not have to leave their own communities to seek opportunity. We must address historic inequities to ensure that all neighborhoods have sufficient public and private investment. 4 Creates a single, independent, countywide housing solutions agency to fund and approve housing: It’s beyond time for the largest county in the nation to have a single, unified approach to housing, with the authority and funding necessary to meet our needs, especially for low-wage workers.",

An abstract presented on MSR in 2017 at UCLA showed significant unadjusted bivariate self-reported outcomes on pre- and post-surveys as well as an acceptance rate to medical school of 55%, 10% above the overall national acceptance rate. A more recent analysis of our 2018-2019 cohort revealed an acceptance rate of over 90% for those who applied.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Latinx’s comprise over 40% of California’s population, yet only 5% of the overall physician population and 12% of graduating physicians in the state. At this rate, it will take 500 years for the proportion of Latinx physicians to match their proportion in the population. Similar disparities exist for Black/African American populations in California. The lack of diversity in the physician workforce contributes to worse outcomes for patients and perceived lesser quality of care. Over one-third of Latinx students who attend college start at a community college. In the Los Angeles County Community College District which comprises nine colleges and 229,793 students, 72.3% of the students are from underrepresented in medicine (UIM) backgrounds. In order to effectively address the lack of physician workforce diversity, it is critical to properly engage and mentor Latinx and other UIM students while they are at community colleges."

Communities of color have been facing racial problems in the shadows for too long. Low income communities and communities of color disproportionally experience contaminated tap water. We saw this problem most notoriously in Flint, but contaminated drinking water is a problem throughout the country.

For families living below the Federal poverty line (ie $24,858 for a family of four), 30.8% are food insecure. According to the our theory of change, programming will scale up and there will be improved community access to sustainable and climate-resilient solutions and in turn, improved health outcomes and workforce development.

County will have a scalable model for bridging the digital divide in neighborhoods that are low-income and/or home to primarily BIPOC and immigrant residents who have historically been left out of the community planning process. It is generally considered best practice for neighborhood-scale improvement projects to be initiated and led by local stakeholders; doing so fosters community pride, helps secure buy-in, and ensures that improvements are responsive to genuine community needs and desires. LANI's long-term goals for this program are to continue to meet people where they are, to support them in envisioning changes to their built environment, and to enhance their capacity to be advocates and decision makers for their own communities by improving their access to and understanding of the digital tools that are becoming increasingly integral to this work.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "In 2020, consistent internet access became even more essential. But too many people who live, learn, and work in LANI neighborhoods struggle to access technology, which makes engaging them in planning and improvement projects that will impact their daily lives more challenging. Some conditions that cause this “digital divide” include the expense of a laptop, tablet and/or internet service; language barriers; not having email or social media accounts; and concerns about internet security and privacy. These challenges overlap with traditional barriers to equitable stakeholder involvement in underserved communities; limits on gathering in-person have added even more complication. A prior focus on digital access in rural areas has not addressed the same problem in low-income urban communities, which often are also majority BIPOC or immigrant communities. In an era of virtual meetings, telehealth, and online shopping for necessities, the digital divide poses significant equity issues.",

With full funding, we will engage a new part-time staff member for the grant period to manage support at Digital Meetings and provide materials to help participants with general online literacy, like establishing email or social media accounts, ensuring internet safety and privacy, and accessing web translation tools. During the pandemic, virtual meetings and online data gathering have replaced the in-person outreach and engagement strategies we have long relied on, and post-pandemic, online community engagement will continue to be a component of neighborhood improvement projects; we have seen that virtual engagement can even increase community participation because it does not require transportation, childcare, or extended time away from work or family. To engage diverse stakeholders in the planning process during and post-COVID, the digital divide must be addressed so that senior citizens, non-English speakers, families with young children, people with disabilities, and others can fully engage in decisions about how the built environment in their neighborhoods can make life better.",

Approximately 75% of students attending these schools identify as Hispanic/Latina and 21% identify as Black/African American. Youth in these areas must overcome a myriad of systemic barriers to success, including poverty, food insecurity, racism and homelessness. They contend with higher crime rates, more gang activity and fewer amenities than peers in higher-income communities.

We will collaborate with allies inside and outside City Hall to share our findings and to dialogue with partners to shape a series of recommendations. Our project is also focused on co-powering processes with other community groups looking to engage in budget advocacy in the City.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "City of Los Angeles",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Los Angeles is the only large city in the US that currently lacks a capital infrastructure plan. No one has a clear picture of where billions of public works and transportation funds have gone over the years, and there is no public accessible funding plan for future investments.The lack of transparency leaves Angelenos in the dark about projects that would benefit their neighborhood, as well as what is budgeted by policymakers. Transportation is more than just how we get around, it is one of the primary determinants of whether Angelenos can access opportunities across the region. However, current transportation infrastructure does not adequately address the needs of the diverse communities and cultures that make up Los Angeles. Transportation policies in Los Angeles continue to foster inequities, which will only worsen without an affirmative commitment by the City to reorganize our transportation networks around racial justice, procedural equity and community-led solutions."

In Los Angeles 63 to every 100,000 person has experience sexual violence. This trauma can result in severe physical and emotional trauma. Deploying targeted psychotherapeutic treatment that is individualized for the survivor is important to achieving optimal patient outcomes. There are several valid and evidence-based treatments available for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and interpersonal difficulties that can result from sexual abuse and assault. Voices Beyond Assault is working to end the societal issue of sexual violence and focus on survivor rehabilitation and healing. stereotypical of victimhood and powerlessness is of the past.

The San Fernando Valley Audubon Society (SFVAS) offers regular birding outings, and works with Resource Conservation District of Santa Monica Mountains to offer LAUSD Title 1 students a day of outdoor curriculum. But for anyone with a disability or even limited stamina, the site is a problem. There is nowhere for anyone to rest along the trail, no accommodations for the deaf or blind, and no accommodations for wheelchairs. Disabled Veterans, North Los Angeles Regional Center(NLACRC) consumers (28,0000) who are blind, in a wheelchair or have physical limits do not use the SBWR.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "This proposal seeks to address inequalities at SBWR by making it accessible for everyone, despite physical or cognitive disabilities. The first basic need is for visitors to be seated briefly as they proceed around the lake. At present there are only two seats, while there is a need for eight more. The benches proposed are ADA and LA City Parks & Rec approved. This proposal also includes a new cell phone audiotour package, that allows visitors to learn about ecology by listening to pre-recorded segments, using signposts at each bench that have the dial-in information, and in Braille (the system also provides captions for the deaf, and has a GPS interactive map). Anyone can access the system and the system provides usage data reports. This software is used by NPS and many museums and community entities. For wheelchair users, equipment is requested that would allow scopes and binoculars to be attached to the wheelchair and adapted to individual needs. Beach wheelchairs are also requested for those whose chairs cannot deal with the gravel trail. Teaching modules will also be developed so that faculty can teach LAUSD special needs kids, and equipment to allow tactile teaching is requested (taxidermy birds and teaching skins that can be touched, necessary for the blind and for cognitive issues). These tools would allow a child or client to actually touch the feathers, wingspan, the head and feet of a bird (e.g., hawk, duck, pelican) and fully understand the subject.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "All of these efforts seek to make SPWR an experience for all citizens in our area, not just those who are able. Birding and ecology will be available to Special Needs as well as regular LAUSD Title 1 students; blind, deaf, and senior visitors will be served by the additional seating and improved curriculum. The ecology and conservation information will be available to all using the principles of Universal Design on the audiotour system. SFVAS will share our knowledge with all Chapters of Audubon all around Los Angeles, and will serve as a model for LA City Parks and Rec to roll out across the City. We will engage with the local VA to bring disabled Veterans to the SBWR and enable them to access the outdoors and birding. We are already reaching to Lion's Club, Braille Institute, Paralyzed Veteans Association, and AARP, to increase use. We will work long-term with these organizations to measure client satisfaction, attitude to the outdoors, and general mental health impacts.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "This proposal will eliminate barriers for the disabled in the existing SBWR setting and teaching curriculum. Teacher satisfaction is already measured during the school year program, and will now include special needs classes. The audiotour software allows for year-round usage data, and satisfaction data can be collected. For the classes and birding outings, SFVAS checks out equipment and tracks it, so that data can be reported out. The VA clinics are anxious to resume outings, and number about 600 individuals per year (with satisfaction), so that data will be collected. NLACRC also has significant numbers of clients who wish to use SBWR. SFVAS, which already offers birding trips, will add a data column to track disabled users. No data is collected about these agencies use of SBWR at present, but they are all expressing a keen interest in our activities, and therefore the data collected will be significant.",

However, workers across these industries do not reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of our youth, who are primarily LatinX and Black/African American. To make greater gains in racial equity, it is vital to nurture and arm marginalized youth with tools to access and sustainably thrive in creative industries. Unfortunately, when 87% of APCH families live below the federal poverty line ($26,500/family of four), artistic pursuits are seen as a luxury and not an important opportunity for economic/social mobility. COVID-19 has drastically impacted the LA creative landscape where artists must now be multi-disciplinarily, digitally, and technologically fluent to be competitive in an oversaturated market. Community arts events at APCH will provide our members with valuable industry exposure, an equitable creative landscape, and a platform to share urgent issues within their community.",

These events are produced and run by staff and youth members - valuable opportunities for our young people to build 21st century job skills. Hundreds of members will present creative work and have recorded material to add to their portfolio for professional and postsecondary pursuits.

Events will include: The LatinX Theater Festival; Comic, Art, and Literacy Expo (CALE); APCH Studio Album; The Moondance Film Festival; public recitals; First Film Friday’s; virtual art exhibitions; and virtual theater productions. Since 1993, APCH has offered after school arts education through its no-cost program model to youth ages 8 - 24. Our creative avenues introduce the arts to members, guide them towards professional careers, and leverage our community partnerships with movie studios, nationally renowned artists, musicians, actors, agencies, and more, to provide invaluable industry exposure. We are a community hub for youth development with a 32,000 sq. ft. center that includes instructional spaces, a dance studio, a state-of-the-art theater, an art gallery, and a professionally equipped recording studio.",

Academic performance is tracked using grades in core classes, and attendance records. We use Hello Insight surveys to measure SEL skills and use the results to create customized plans for individual participants. To evaluate the depth of participation we look at a few key metrics; hours of participation per year per participant, annual rates of attendance, year over year retention, and graduation rates.

Our unique model is particularly well-suited to meet our players' specific needs. Program Directors are professional coaches with years of experience in trauma-informed practices, education, and youth development. HL-LA’s programs foster meaningful relationships between PD’s and players, leading to higher engagement and trust. HL-LA programs combine SEL activities with customized study skills, leadership training, and character-building lacrosse activities. Since reaching your goals never takes a season off, Harlem Lacrosse plays year-round and the average participant enjoys over 250 hours of programming annually.

Our expansion will mean we can double the number of high school aged youth we serve. HL-LA will contribute to LA2050’s goal of improving the number of youth participating in sports, since most of our players have never played any sport before joining our teams. LA City schools will increase the number of HS lacrosse teams as more youth learn the sport through Harlem Lacrosse and other community-based lacrosse organizations.

While lacrosse is the fastest growing sport in America, its growth has barely penetrated the invisible boundaries between affluent suburbs and low-income, urban neighborhoods. HL-LA brings lacrosse to local parks and schools that would otherwise never be exposed to the game. HL-LA’s student-athletes are asked to overcome obstacles like poverty, housing and food insecurity, and trauma with fewer programs and tools at their disposal than their more affluent peers. HL-LA levels the playing field by ensuring all participants can be part of a team, compete, and have fun.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Los Angeles is rightly recognized as a leader in global cultural trends and boasts a vibrant economy and a bold civic landscape. To celebrate and promote awareness of textiles is to support our collective economic, artistic, and social health. Textile Month Los Angeles is a multi-location, multi-disciplinary event that features artist talks, author talks, research presentations, workshops, exhibits, studio tours, and demos in virtual and small audience live events. Last year's participating venues and speakers included (partial list) Craft Contemporary, Craft in America, Museum of Latin American Art, Wende Museum, Studio 203, artists Jovencio de la Paz and Michael Olszewski, researcher and poet Teju Adisa-Farrar, and curator from NYC's Museum of Art & Design Elissa Auther, also the author of String, Felt, Thread, a critical text expanding on textile arts' position in the fine art pantheon. We offered 16 artist talks, 4 author talks, more than a dozen exhibits and half a dozen workshops. Textile Month 2021 seeks to expand our slate of participating artists and institutions; increase the participation of commercial partners such as fashion brands, architecture and interior design studios; improve our outreach among BIPOC and LGBTQ communities, and add more panels that bring together industry, government, and education to explore how our community can enliven the study and practice of textile arts.",

In September 2019, year one, we had 2800 website visitors, earned $8100 in revenues, and sold 92 “units.” In September 2020, year two and hosted virtually, we had 5600 website visitors, earned $5,700 in revenue, and sold 456 units. These are not all inclusive (many events are hosted off our platform) nor are they apples to apples, as we hosted considerably more free events due to the pandemic. But we are showing a significant increase in traffic, which tells us we are growing. Our revenues are almost entirely turned around as speaking fees, which indicates that we are creating an economic platform for artists and speakers. Anecdotally, we know that artists have been discovered and commissioned, graduate students enrolled, designers hired, partnerships formed, projects launched, and opportunities uncovered.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Textile Month Los Angeles is an opportunity to host a conversation that naturally weaves together commerce, art, and culture, about a subject that is familiar to us all yet profound in its reach and depth. TMLA offers a creative, accessible platform to celebrate, educate, and enliven our communities. It creates a series of public spaces to respond critically to timely questions in manufacturing and education, in art and craft; offers multiple creative and economic touchpoints; signals that an art practice can have a transformative, meaningful role in the community; provokes dialogue that addresses textiles' relevance to racial-social-community issues; engages artists in making, across socio-economic, racial, geographic landscapes; fosters a sense of shared purpose. We have an opportunity to re-imagine the collective health and wellbeing of ourselves as individuals, citizens, and consumers. Los Angeles will be recognized as a leader in the re-emergence of re-imagined textile future.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Textile Month Los Angeles is an opportunity to celebrate textiles and raise awareness of their critical role in our lives, our fortunes, and our futures. Textiles swaddle us at birth and shroud us in death. They offer us shelter and warmth through clothing, furnishings, and building materials; they signal allegiances and status. They are flags, uniforms, costumes, sails, band t-shirts, sheets, and shoes. They can be studied as an art form or practiced as a design craft, and are the basis of one of LA's largest manufacturing sectors - the garment industry. Textiles are at the epicenter of a global conversation about climate change, racial justice, and social disparities. Our challenge is connecting the power and storytelling of textiles across industries: fashion, film and tv, art and design, and academia, to the economic, social, and civic value of nurturing and sustaining this universal, essential object-craft.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Our project consists of two main components: a physical space in Historic South Central and an annual fellowship program. Our Memoryhaus is the home for our community programming and a site where youth in the South LA community can gather in interdependent study. Monthly programming is inclusive of experiences like communal discourse, sound healing, multimedia creation related to the present exhibitions and the opportunity for the community to publicly present their work for engagement. In this way, the community is able to explore the SCOPE curriculum in a way that integrates unique understandings into their daily life. Functionally, the space consists of a showroom exhibiting material artifacts, a research library, and an outdoor classroom. The Archive Caretaker Fellowship was created to empower the intuition and curiosity of local artists, futurists, and historians. The individuals in harmony with the collective will engage in 6 months of shared study, from October 2021 through March 2022, to explore overlooked histories, unimagined futures, and contemporary solutions in fellowship with local caretakers. Our curriculum incorporates concepts like time, space, love and post colonialism but engages them from the unique perspective of the individual in the context of their personal understanding. In this way, critical dialogue is cultivated through explorations of self to better inform both a collective learning and a solution based process of knowledge production.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Historical awareness is a necessary foundation in the development of Black youth in their quest to self actualize. At this time, there are few reflective opportunities for Black youth to explore the circumstances of their experiences. Intellectual gate-keeping prevents them from understanding the parallels in their present experiences and those of their ancestors. We aspire to cultivate communal appreciation, reflection and healing by intentionally connecting the experiences of Black Angelenos to those of the larger Black diasporic experience in the United States. As a community centered, community operated archival space, we intend to cultivate the conditions to work towards a shared vision of what Los Angeles can represent for Black youth presently and in the future, formed by them. Our fellows develop unique frameworks of collective leadership, to be explored in their personal practice as artists and archivists and in the SCOPE space for larger communal engagement.",

Beginning in October 2020, fellows participated in a rigorous discourse based curriculum. Qualitatively, fellows engaged the curriculum material throughout the fellowship from the framework of their current practices as artists and archivists. Upon completion of the program, fellows developed Material Artifacts (archival pieces) that incorporated their learnings throughout the fellowship in an interactive format. Fellows also developed workshops that centered their learnings for the larger community to participate in from mid-March to mid-April 2021. Quantitatively, fellows and participants in the various workshop experiences self reported through a survey their satisfaction with the experience. A total of 62 members of the community participated in intimate, appointment-based fellowship presentations at our archival space.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated both the lack of available resources in predominantly Black communities and the ways anti-Blackness is inherent in so many systems in the United States. As a result, Black people of all ages in South Central have been unable to imagine their actualization forcing them into uninspiring experiences of life with little to no upward mobility. The infrastructure within which we live our lives and explore the possibilities for our communities are outdated. The remnants of past resources and opportunities are unable to keep up with the constantly growing and changing needs of Black people. The deficit framing of Black culture contributes to the perception of impossibility around reinvestment. Community does not lack an abundance of information or knowledge by which we may reimagine our circumstances and sense of self, what we require is space and time to apply historic know-how towards present ways of being."

A SPEAKUP! self-assessment survey asks participants to reflect on their art project with the 4Cs in mind: Communication, Creativity and Innovation, Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, and Collaboration. artworxLA has also developed a 14-point questionnaire as a means to refine program offerings to answer individual challenges. Beyond skill acquisition and quality of artwork, artworxLA will evidence positive results on percentage staying in school and on track to graduate. Student Zion said, “I learned that as a team we can do anything. Especially with the school environment I’m in right now.

We succeed by providing meaningful collaborations and creative networks to advance shared community goals.

Linked to artworxLA’s Level 1 classroom workshops—in which students create original artwork that addresses socio-political themes—our Design and Media Arts Academy (DMAA) students created a podcast series entitled Power Over Stigma, which explores life in the alternative HS system from their perspective. Students anticipate working on each episode which features a student “guest” interview in-studio and field recordings documenting aspects of their life—as affected by negative stereotypes. Inspired by the exhibition “Banish Stigma: The Power of Personal Voice and Representation,” at the Fowler Museum in UCLA, participants related to the concept of “stigma” in multiple cultural and historical contexts, informed by the photography exhibition Through Positive Eyes about people living with HIV. Applying the concept in their own lives, Power Over Stigma, emerged from a classroom discussion Ms. Gaberman had with a disengaged teen who said that he and his peers have been labeled the “bad kids” who would never meet expectations.",

Students build skills that will allow them to lift themselves and their families out of multigenerational poverty. Law enforcement officers build supportive relationships with youth and guide them toward success. Acceler8's classes center on STEM learning via automotive technology, from basic engineering, science and mathematics around the design of engines and drivetrain mechanics to the intricate computers and technology that tie systems together. Students also receive training in career and life skills, including resume and interview classes, dress/image, team building, communication and social skills. Acceler8’s goals for funding are two-fold: 1) To secure and lease a standing garage facility in which to conduct our automotive classes. We have been fortunate to hold classes in some world-class gifted garage spaces, including the Petersen Automotive Museum and Barrus Kustom Motors. As great as this has been for our students, dedicated space would allow us to accommodate more students and to store our tools and vehicles safely, as well as providing a work environment for our Instructors and lead staff. 2) To hire a full time Mechanic Instructor to lead classes each semester, reducing our reliance on the availability of volunteer instructors.",

A study by the Brookings Institute of the at-risk students that we serve acknowledges that just 14% will complete 4-year degrees. They state, “A better approach…would be to develop coherent pathways, beginning in high school, into authentic technical education options.” Our classes provide the opportunity for true economic equity for our students, 95% of whom are persons of color. We anticipate that they will build their skillset and confidence so that they are more empowered and capable of making better decisions for their future. Our vision is contained in the words of a father, who had just been released from prison, approaching us tearfully, “Oh my God, you saved my son’s life. If it wasn’t for this program, he would have ended up in prison like me.” That heartfelt moment is why Acceler8 was created and how we will make Los Angeles a better place.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Youth arrests in Los Angeles have affected over 31,000 youth from ages 10-24 since 2016. One of the primary reasons young people become involved with gangs and crime is a lack of positive role models and direction. There is a distinct lack of opportunities for engagement and vocational education for youth that can provide structure. Gangs and crime involvement can then become a substitute for caring adults, addressing low self-esteem, the desire for a sense of belonging and safety or protection. This lack of direction and hopelessness, resulting in juvenile crime involvement, affects not only youth but also the Los Angeles communities in which they reside. A 2016 Los Angeles Times article reports that LA County spends $233,000 per year to hold each youth in juvenile lockup; money much better spent in providing education, hope and direction to assist them in becoming the responsible adults and stable leaders of tomorrow."

We selected evaluation tools based on each program’s goals from Generation United’s Intergenerational Evaluation Toolkit. Early findings from programs as short as 10 hours showed that positive relationships formed. “Youngers” were amazed at their commonality with the “olders,” and felt validated by the “olders’” investment in them. Both older and younger participants gained the confidence to reach out to more people and connect, which was especially encouraging during a pandemic when isolation has been so high.

This projects will allow writers, directors and even actors to work remotely. If creators are not capable of being in the studio, they can work and collaborate remotely - in real time. With our studio in Hollywood used more actively to connect playwrights and train young actors with film makers from local film schools - we are able to produce high quality, short pieces independently, while introducing theatre arts to the next generation. Also, playwrights and theatre artists would be able to record and archive their work, which usually only live in the moment of live theatre.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "We will build a 1,200 square foot Tool Library in the City of Compton as a template for others to be built in the LA region. The model will copy the longstanding Berkley Tool Library as they have been the prototype for Oakland’s, Portland’s, and Seattle’s Tool Library. We will offer 3,500+ hardware, landscaping and crafting tools to accommodate home and garden projects, small business development, and emergency supplies. We will partner with EntreNous Youth Empowerment Services, to provide staffing, as a paid internship program to their YouthBuild students. Once built, we will offer DIY classes, and hold quarterly repair café events with volunteer support from local experts. Rediscover Center, a kid’s makerspace in Venice has offered to support us in the development of the library, as they have 10 years of experience in a similar operation and an Executive Director with a Degree in Library Science. Additionally, they will participate in regular Repair Café events to support local kids’ tool learning and making. Operations will be supported through late fees, sliding scale membership for users outside the City of Compton, tool manufactures sponsorships, and grants from the Community for Career Development for the internship program. LA2050 funding, will finalize a lease agreement, begin the renovation of the space, and purchase the shelving, equipment, software, initial tools and a giant sign - 2021 WINNERS of LA2050 Challenge Grant proudly display above the help counter.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "EntreNous Youth Empowerment Services, Inc. operates the Compton YouthBuild. They will fund and create a paid on-the-job internship program, for students to work at the Tool Library. The interns will be trained to manage the tool inventory and database, provide customer support, help customers learn to use the tools safely, and participate in the repair café events. YouthBuild students will gain confidence, expand their network, and may begin to create their own side businesses. Rediscover Center is a kid’s makerspace in Venice, CA. They want to expand their reach into underserved communities and will bring child-centered tools and makerspace programs to the library. The Executive Director has a degree in Library Science and will support the development of the operations and inventory.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We have surveyed and will implement the best strategies from seven very successful tool library operations for their membership, cost to operate, and volunteer services. Our unique part is our collaboration with Compton YouthBuild to support staffing. We have based our initial tool inventory and protocols from the 40-year-old Berkeley Tool Library. Once built, we will track and analyze data on the frequency of tools borrowed, types of projects, and demographics of the members (Skill level, gender, and age). This will help hone tool replacement frequency, and quantity needs. Tracking the projects and demographics will help refine tool training, types of DIY classes, and outreach mode and messaging. This data will support development for other Tool Libraries in the region. A common Tool Library App – myturn.com, will be used to gather data, manage tool inventory and memberships. We will also gather data at the service counter for training needs and project types.",

It suffers more severely from climate change events such as storms, flooding, and heat, due to homes being uninsulated, lack of air-conditioning, old roofing, and little to no energy efficiencies. The residents and nearby neighborhoods need an affordable way to update and repair their homes and be empowered to respond to disasters quickly by having access to emergency tools and supplies. Compton is also a community that is interested in re-branding itself for its notorious reputation. The city and its residents need resources to re-built itself, one home/one business at a time.",

We will support this effort through social media outreach and direct calls to city Libraries and home improvement nonprofits. This in turn will create a network of tool libraries to expand climate change resiliency for the entire region. Furthermore, tools will be available throughout Los Angeles, not only for resiliency and home improvements but also to sustain family career pathways. The Library will have tools for people wanting to start a small business such as; handyman, landscaping, or carpet installation to name a few. To further support small business development, our Tool Library will also have some tools for craft Makers to borrow; various types of sewing machines, vinyl cutters, sublimation presses, and so on. Tool Libraries will become as common in Los Angeles as they are in Northern California."

Food on Foot is addressing underlying issues such as a lack of confidence/lack of trust, dependency challenges, stigma that affects people experiencing homelessness in extremely competitive housing and employment markets. Since 1998, Food on Foot has supported clients through the difficult process of permanently leaving behind the streets to focus on cultivating skills and attributes necessary for long-term success in permanent housing and long-term employment.

We track job and housing retention for the 12-month period following program graduation. After one year, graduated are generally able to maintain market rate rentals without the costly public-funded supportive services that higher-acuity homeless require. Food on Foot’s metrics serve as a robust indicator of a successful re-entry program into mainstream society for individuals who had previously been unable to access necessary services. FoF's success rate is virtually unparalleled among systems intended to help the homeless regain their independence, in part because of the personalized services that our staff and volunteers provide to clients. FoF goes beyond case management and housing/employment placement to ensure that each individual has the unique resources that he/she needs for success.",

Program participants work with licensed clinicians and other trained and experienced program professionals to achieve a progression of steps that starts with employment training opportunities, the receipt of food gift cards, and access to counseling. After demonstrating a strong work ethic and determination to succeed, participants begin preparing for full-time job opportunities and to secure permanent housing (market-rate studio apartments). Once gainfully employed, Food on Foot enables participants to move into their own apartment and subsidizes their rent and all basic expenses for up to twelve months while allowing participants to save their own funds. During this initial period, participants receive intensive support, case management, and financial subsidies to help them get back on their feet. After the first year in the program, participants have not only successfully shifted their own personal and professional trajectory, but have also begun mentoring other program participants that are just beginning to embark on their own journey off the streets.",

Students in these circumstances graduate high school at rates that are nearly 22 percentage points lower than their middle- and upper-income peers. This inequity is due in part to a lack of access to educational opportunities and individualized supports that are designed to meet the intensity of student need. Current school closures and distance learning undoubtedly create more barriers that can compromise students’ academic and life outcomes. According to the NWEA, students will likely see learning loss similar to that of other disruptive crises or to the “summer slide” crises. This learning loss is likely to be exacerbated by the additional aspects of trauma students are experiencing, particularly the students we serve who come from households impacted the most economically.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "As Los Angeles and Inglewood Unified Schools Districts operate via remote virtual learning, our AmeriCorps members continue to serve as student success coaches in a virtual capacity. We focus on the three types of interventions known as “Early Warning Indicators” of being off-track from graduation for students – attendance, behavior, and course performance. We have pivoted our service to adapt to the ever-changing needs of our schools and students. City Year Los Angeles has developed a variety of options to implement our course performance and social-emotional development interventions virtually or in a hybrid remote/in-person capacity, when the time comes. Our AmeriCorps members lead breakout rooms to review specific academic concepts with small groups of students, call home to promote attendance or assist with technological issues, host virtual afterschool spaces where they can help with homework and class material, set goals with students around social-emotional competencies, and perform regular check-ins with students to monitor their growth in those areas, among a myriad of other supports. AmeriCorps members’ invaluable presence in virtual classrooms will help to mitigate learning loss. This grant award will help us maintain a strong cohort of AmeriCorps members who work hard to decrease the potentially widening skill gaps of our students, help create differentiation in the virtual and in person environments, and to assist teachers in virtual settings.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If our work is successful, our students will be better equipped academically and social-emotionally to return to in-person learning. Prior to the pandemic, City Year was the subject of a study with the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University to explore whether there is a connection between social-emotional and academic outcomes and understand whether there is a correlation between time with an AmeriCorps member (ACM) and student outcomes. The study found a strong connection between social-emotional development and academic outcomes. According to the study, improving in just one area of social-emotional development is equivalent to gaining a year of schooling. This analysis validated City Year’s holistic approach by revealing that we support improvements in academic outcomes through the direct effect of English Language Arts or math tutoring time with an ACM, and through social-emotional support from an ACM, which correlated with stronger academic outcomes.",

This year, we have our highest ever approval ratings from our partner teachers! 95% believe that CYLA AmeriCorps members are having a positive impact with students. During a typical school year, we would measure our academic impact by using the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) Inventory exams and the Deveraux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA) to measure students’ academic and social-emotional development. This year, we will not administer the HMH inventory or DESSA, as those tests have not been built for the virtual space and as AmeriCorps members must be physically present when the tests are taken.",

However, most of the nearly 36,000 probationers in LA County are unaware of their eligibility and are unlikely to show up to vote without encouragement. Among this population, 16% are ages 18-24 and 77% are people of color, making this an issue of not only access, but racial equity. The voices of those impacted by the criminal justice system, who are disproportionately Black and Brown, are critical to our democracy. Voting provides a sense of belonging and agency within society and can therefore be a transformative piece of an individual’s reentry process. More, decisions that maintain oppressive structures and systems too often exclude the input of those who have been harmed by those systems. For true criminal justice reform to occur, the people most impacted by the unjust and racialized systems have to be at the center of decision making about where we go from here.",

Through our Free the Vote work in 2020 in partnership with ODR, we turned out 580 justice system impacted individuals at the polls who otherwise might not have voted. We achieved this feat despite the challenges of a global pandemic through activities like public events, workshops and trainings, phone banking, in-person outreach, and social media. We track and report all data related to outreach efforts, civic engagement activities, and voter registrations with two tools: PDI and BLOCS. Based on our data, we know that LA Voice voters turn out at a rate at least 10% higher than the average voter in LA County.

Additionally, we will host a townhall event featuring significant participation by big names in the criminal justice reform space in November for National Voter Registration Day. Based on our success in 2020, we know that this work makes a real impact in elections. We need now to build engagement in interim elections and remain in contact both with those system impacted individuals who voted and those who did not. We must continue to build our community’s power to hold lawmakers accountable. The California state legislature is proposing several bills around criminal justice, and we have the opportunity now to build awareness of the initiatives that will create alternatives to incarceration, usher in police reform, and restore dignity to individuals and communities.",

In the short term, LA Free the Vote aims to get 500 system impacted individuals to the polls, armed with the information they need to use their voice in legislative decisions that impact their lives. We aim to empower more folks like Karl, a justice system impacted individual who voted for the first time at age 56. “LA Voice helped me understand what was on the ballot in layman’s terms. I knew what I was voting for and the results that I was looking for.” We work to awaken people to their power through action and education so that our systems reflect the needs and interests of our most vulnerable citizens. When all members of a community have a say in the systems and services available to them, lives are transformed, recidivism is reduced, and democracy is strengthened, leading to a stronger, more connected Los Angeles."

More than 13,000 middle and high school students have been consistently disengaged in fall 2020. An additional 56,000 did not actively participate on a daily basis. School closures have accelerated many existing inequities and mental health challenges for students. A national poll reported that 46% of parents say their teen had shown signs of a new or worsening mental health condition.

Based on an analysis of Fender Play app usage, we learned that students from the 2020 fall semester who reenrolled for the 2021 spring semester watched more lessons a week than those who didn't continue with the program. We also discovered that students who reenrolled watched twice as many lessons on their “off days” (days without classes) as those who didn't continue with the program. Based on demographic data from LAUSD, we are monitoring enrollment and engagement for students of color, low-income students, English learners, foster youth, students with disabilities and homeless students.

Students also receive free access to Fender Play, a digital platform for learning and practicing their instrument. For inspiration, professional musicians host field trips to share their music experiences directly with students, teachers and parents. At the end of each semester, students always get to keep their instrument and have the opportunity to continue learning with our program. Over 58% of students from the 2020 fall semester reenrolled to keep playing in the 2021 spring semester. In survey responses, multiple students have expressed the mental health benefits of learning an instrument through our program. Here are a handful of responses from the most recent survey during the 2021 spring semester: “I feel happy when playing the guitar. It helps me when I'm stressed.” “Online learning is pretty stressful and getting lost into the music playing guitar really helps.” “I feel refreshed most of the time, because I play my instrument as a break from work.” “It’s fun and helpful for my anxiety.”",

In order to increase the telehealth capacity, a technology assessment needs to be conducted and upgrades are necessary to the current system. Telehealth provides an opportunity to keep participants engaged especially in times of crises, as well as during the normal course of business and the use of video-chat has become common practice for people to connect with social supports. One of the biggest barriers is not having the devices with the capabilities to connect due to either lack of data plan, limited data plan, or no internet connection. Telehealth is bound to stay even after the COVID-19 pandemic is over and we return to a new normal in our lives. Telehealth made it convenient for many to see doctors virtually, skip waiting rooms, and stay safe while receiving services. Many support groups have expanded their access by creating virtual rooms for people to join. This initiative would improve technology capacity and provide tablets to program participants to use while in treatment. Technology that most people often take for granted is a luxury that many others cannot afford and exacerbates existing disparities in health, education, and income.",

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need to increase accessibility to services through technology for vulnerable populations such as those with mental health conditions and Substance Use Disorders (SUD). In a survey of all participants throughout our treatment programs, we found that only 22% had access to devices compatible with telehealth and video-conferencing. This is extremely concerning as disruption to treatment services and social isolation can be devastating for people in recovery. In a recent study conducted by Hulsey, Mellis, and Kelly (2020), 34% of 1079 respondents reported that they experienced accessibility problems in treatment and recovery support, and 20% reported increased substance use due to COVID-19. Video chatting and telehealth have become a lifeline to many, but disparities in technology access prevents many from getting the supports they need to maintain their recovery."

While on a community walk with 5th-grade students, we use the MyLA311 app and use it to help them report graffiti and trash in their neighborhood. As one of the kids was about to photograph a discarded refrigerator say, we overheard him say, “Wouldn't this be cool if it were a game!” Cue the light-bulb emoji. That inspiration led to this proposal. The “game” or competition aspect of Our Town is self-defined by each member group. Each group can set up as many “teams” as desired. In turn, each team can set up internal teams, and so on. (For instance, a member group might be a school, which could have sub-groups of grade-levels. Within the grade-level, the different classes are teams. Additionally they can establish teams within the class. A team could conceivably be one person. Each group will create a competition page where they will set the terms of their competition (geographic boundaries, finish-date, team-participation rules, etc.), plus they can set the value and scoring aspects of their specific competition. For instance, reporting a graffiti tag that is ultimately removed is worth 2 points, while planting a garden may be 10 points, painting a mural 20, etc. Each participating team will have a page that is populated by the status of their filed reports along with pictures and blog posts about their community improvement and beautification project(s).",

While 51% of 3rd graders tested proficient, proficiency dropped dramatically to 31% by grade 11. Studies demonstrate learning loss has been most acute in K-8 math during pandemic distance learning. The NWEA’s comparison of fall 2019 to fall 2020 assessment results across 4.4 million students found math skills dropped between 5-10%. Math is increasingly becoming a barrier, rather than a gateway, for accessing the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in the global economy. The key reason: most teachers focus on formal procedures to solve textbook problems, rather than help students develop a conceptual understanding of what those procedures mean and how they apply to other situations. Students in lower-income schools and students of color are more likely to be taught procedures rather than conceptual understanding.",

Most importantly, in the long-term, LA County will have a stronger pipeline of talent prepared and motivated to complete rigorous STEM oriented degrees in higher education and in technical schools, lifting our degree completion rates and time to completion. LA County will become more attractive to high wage industries such as Biopharmaceuticals and Information Technology, which require a highly skilled workforce.

Raising educational outcomes will future proof the city from this trend.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Highly capable, effective, and engaging teachers are the most critical factor for students to succeed in math and feel empowered to pursue STEM oriented careers. Strengthening the bench of teachers will make a profound difference. Thus, the TEAMS initiative will train a cohort of teachers in shifting from a procedural textbook approach to helping their students develop a deep conceptual understanding of math. This pedagogical approach is based on research that shows students learn through a process of “progressive formalization” where they develop increasingly abstract and deeper understandings of a concept by first making sense of their informal knowledge before moving on to formalized rules and procedures. This approach, along with the related tools and training, has already demonstrated its effectiveness in a randomized controlled study. Thus, in this initiative, teachers will be trained on using this approach, and then engage in job-embedded coaching for the academic year, using the Responsive Teaching Cycle (RTC), a model that has also demonstrated effectiveness in previous studies. With RTC, teams of teachers and coaches work together to create Progressive Formalization Tasks (PFTs). PFTs are pre-designed lesson templates for Common Core math standards, all available online and customizable by the user. As more teachers develop the ability to adopt this approach, they can then become champions of PFTs to their colleagues, which can sustain this effort beyond the grant.",

Based on scores from over 7,300 8th grade students across 10 school districts in California, the impact of using PFTs was remarkably positive and statistically significant (with large effect sizes of 0.7 and 1.139). Most notably, the intervention eliminated the achievement gap between English learners (EL) and their non-EL counterparts. Similar to the i3 study, TEAMS will be evaluated with a mix of quantitative and qualitative data. Using a quasi-experimental design, TEAMS will compare program teachers’ student learning outcomes with that of non-participating teachers. TEAMS will also collect ongoing, formative data to inform continuous program improvement, including fidelity of implementation measures and feedback from teachers and students on their perceptions of PFTs.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Success means that there are preparations in place across the county to support children and their families when regular child care services are disrupted. We will be able to show the support given to children by providing the amount of campers per day we can serve and the amount of hours and days that parents have to return to work or rebuild their lives in response to disaster. We will map out resources to support this work across the county, enlisting sites pre-arranged to host camps, summer camps that can provide volunteers and connect with parents and potential campers. Project:Camp will connect the dots and provide the network needed to link together sites, volunteers, and families to focus these resources in the event of a disaster.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Our vision is that all children have a safe and joyful space during a disaster. Our goals are to increase the capacity of community organizations across Los Angeles County to provide pop-up day camps in the event of future disasters. We will build a network of trained volunteers to support pop-up camps. We will identify and sign on sites across the county that are willing and able to be used to host camps when the need arises. We will also convene community groups and their members to work with parents to have these resources ready in the event of disaster. The vision is for Project:Camp to be the experts in the room on providing an adaptable, trauma-informed camp model and the resources to train volunteers and run camp. We can then work with community partners to adapt this work to fit the needs and cultures of the communities that we are supporting.",

Disasters have been increasing in frequency and severity. The year 2020 was the sixth consecutive year with 10 or more billion-dollar disasters in the United States. Yet disaster response was not designed to support the needs of children. The National Risk Index (FEMA) shows communities that are least equipped to respond to disaster also tend to be the same communities with increased rates of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), or traumatic experiences that can lead to long-term stress and poor health outcomes in children. Communities need a way to support the mental health of children, while providing space for parents to rebuild their lives. California Surgeon General Dr. Nadine Burke Harris calls for long-term investments in community care to build resilience in the face of increasing disasters (Roadmap for Resilience)",

Though these problems are all deeply rooted and deserving of our time and resources, our main goal is to provide access to an otherwise restricted environment of soccer engagement. The U.S. has a long history of pay to play, and we are here to change that. We are here to identify convertible spaces that will be used to build mini futsal pitches and expand unfettered, free access to communities that for far too long have been priced out of the sport, and subsequently been led to believe that they are not invited. We've found that the most effective way to bridge this equity gap is by employing those from the same communities that we service, so that when the project is at its peak, leadership will be in the hands of those same communities.",

In order to that, though, we need to raise the funds necessary to build these spaces. It's one thing for an organization to come into a community and build, or activate a space. It's a completely different task to fill those organizational positions with people who understand the nuances, and social and cultural dynamics that are involved in the everyday happenings of the communities where these spaces are created. By doing just that; by providing the opportunities to take ownership of programs and operations in stakeholders' hometowns and communities, an infrastructure is created so that regardless of who is “in charge” at the present moment, the power and trajectory of the programs will always be in the hands of the community, not outside influences. The model involves identifying adult aged applicants, preferably past participants who are familiar with the structure of programs, vision and mission and training them to take over all operations on a community level. In turn, these employees will identify the next generation of leaders and be primed to have a self sustaining community operation that is so much more than a soccer club, but a space of safety, inclusion and community pride.",

Approximately 65% of probation youth had family members who had also been arrested/incarcerated. At least one-fifth of youth had some type of Department of Children and Family Services contact prior to their arrest. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention suggests community-based interventions, like those offered by Optimist, are much more effective at improving long-term outcomes than long-term incarceration. These youth are in crucial states of mental and emotional development. Optimist provides treatment, prevention, and early interventions that change the trajectory for high-risk probation and foster youth in Los Angeles, increasing access to mental health services now as well as decreasing the likelihood that these youth will develop severe mental illness as adults.",

In 2020, our outpatient mental health program served 819 youth, with an average age of 11. The average length of service was 6 months. At Optimist, our biggest accomplishment is the long-term difference we make in the lives of the high-risk youth we serve. Through our aftercare program, we find that youth emancipating from Optimist are 31.5% more likely than the national average to make a successful transition to life in the community during the first year following their 18th birthday, meaning they maintain stable employment and/or attend college or trade school, abstain from alcohol and/or drugs, and maintain positive adult relationships.

There are ten recognized ACEs which fall into three general types: (1) abuse; (2) neglect; and (3) household dysfunction. The study found that a person with four or more ACEs is “more likely to experience chronic disease and engage in negative health behavior.” These individuals are more likely to attempt suicide, use injection drugs, be an alcoholic, suffer from depression, smoke and more. The youth served by Optimist have four or more ACEs and require specialized care to allow them to overcome their trauma. It is imperative to provide meaningful intervention to youth impacted by trauma as soon as possible.

A Girl Powerful parent who received a scholarship in February 2021 said, “My daughter Alex really enjoyed the Girl Powerful Summit because they gave her a lot of tools to help her stay positive. They showed her how to self love, how to remind herself every morning that she’s enough, how to use “I am” statements and how fitness is not just good for your body but it keeps you grounded and centered. I appreciate what you do. It’s amazing. Thank you” - Evelin Rojas Girl Powerful also works with foster youth through DCFS and ChildHelp, giving ALL girls the opportunity to feel seen, valued and heard.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "LA County will be different by giving tween and teen girls access to Girl Powerful's virtual self-care summits because it will teach Gen Z that they have the power to change their mood, mindset and outcome by being in charge of their own health. Girls are able to safely register that it feels good to acknowledge their feelings instead of turning to drugs, alcohol, emotional eating or self-harm. Girl Powerful is also a resource for parents, educators and social workers. GP received this email from a parent and now her daughter is heavily involved and benefitting from the program. “My 16 year old daughter is currently going through depression and suffering from anxiety. Through all these years, she has struggled but now during the pandemic things have become more difficult. She lost interest in school and she was not able to pass all her classes. She doesn't motivation, cannot focus and feels overwhelmed. I honestly do not know how to help my daughter anymore.” Girl Powerful helped.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "During the pandemic, Gen Z was the labeled the generation trapped in their bedrooms. GP knows that female youth's mental health is an issue. First pandemic related studies reported that 7 out of 10 teens are struggling with their mental health in some way, with 43% of teens feeling depressed, over 50% having anxiety and 20% reported having suicidal thoughts. (Statistic Site: National 4-H Council) This isn't news to us, as we work with youth / foster youth every week and they use Girl Powerful as a safe space to talk about their emotions with GP counselors and their peers. We hear straight from their mouths that they feel lonely, isolated, suffocated and anxious about their futures. Youth are missing out on their social support systems and feeling of belonging, they are being unable to celebrate milestones, family life and abuse has been magnified and over 2 million youth went missing from school due to inequities in our communities.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Girl Powerful measures the impact of the Girl Powerful Self-Care Summit by multiple factors. The impact of this project will go as follows: - Project Management: Keeping the project on track to ensure that as many tween and teen girls are in attendance to benefit from the series. This includes reaching out to schools, community centers, DCFS, ChildHelp, and community partners such as Athleta Girl and the Girl Scouts to raise awareness of events. - Participant Questionnaire: Each participant will fill out a post event questionnaire relating to their self-esteem and participation in Girl Powerful activities. - Quality: The end of a project phase is a good time for a quality review, tracking participant attendance, growth, testimonials from participants and parents. - Feedback: Collect reports from social workers and counselors who work directly with the foster youth who are in attendance. Girl Powerful also collects feedback from Girl Powerful mentors."

    "slug": "2021/create-transit-culture-and-boost-ridership-via-metro-weekends",
    "yearSubmitted": "2021",
    "organization": "Have A Go",
    "summary": "While LA spends heavily on transit, our ridership numbers remain low, at a shocking 6.8% even before the pandemic. Ridership-boosting projects traditionally focus on work commuting. However, we found this strategy to be quite ineffective because changing an engrained habit on a busy workday is very difficult. But what about on days where people go out of their way to seek novelty: weekends? So this project aims to create transit-oriented weekends with the aim of familiarizing Angelenos with Metro and thus boost ridership over time!",
    "goal": "CONNECT",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "We aim to address traffic, pollution, C02 emissions, and mobility equity stemming from LA’s car-centric transportation system. Traffic: LA leads the nation in traffic, 167 hours every year Pollution: LA County is home to “14 of the nation’s 25 worst cities for air pollution” negatively impacting the health of millions Emissions: Cars & trucks are responsible for 33% of green house gases in LA County Equity: Owning a car costs over $9000 per car every year putting enormous financial burden on lower income families An option to the private car is public transit. Yet LA Metro continues bleeding riders, culminating in a ridership collapse from the COVID pandemic, even as LA invests billions on new lines. Interviews of Angeleno commuters revealed a stunning lack of familiarity with Metro lines and exposed the challenge of changing habits during busy workdays. Our goal is to help grow Metro ridership by addressing these two problems, to help decrease driving and its associated harms.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "We aim to boost transit ridership by habituating Angelenos to Metro via transit-oriented weekends. We will kick off this project with a beautiful poster-map showcasing the many exciting points of interest found along LA’s Metro Rail & BRT network. This piece is designed to mirror the fun and utility of illustrated tourist-style maps inviting urban exploration, while serving as a weekly visual reminder & word-of-mouth generator as a poster. The poster will launch with an IndieGoGo campaign in June 2021, in time for a post-COVID LA. We will use this pilot to gather feedback as well as seed social media with the next phase of the project: once a month events curating points of interest along with local shops, eateries, parks, and bars to create fun weekend plans for Angelenos! We will post these monthly events on a dedicated site and spread the word via social media, blog, and press coverage as well as leverage Have A Go’s growing audience of 5000+ to promote them. We will also put ad dollars to work as well as encourage participants to document their adventures with a dedicated hashtag to further spread the program. The final phase would be creating physical activations along Metro stations. These can start off small, with signage at participating locations and scale up to entire festival-sized events. The breadth of these activations will depend on learnings of the first two phases as well as the size of grants, sponsorships, coverage, and additional partnerships earned.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Have A Go is a startup that believes in clear and measurable goals. First, we will gauge initial interest in this idea during phase one via our crowdfunding goal of $20,000 raised. Second, we will measure the actual use of the poster via the number of a dedicated hashtag used after initial delivery of posters as purchasers capture their Metro weekends: 100 social media posts (to start) Third, we will gauge continued interest in this idea during phase two with number of website visits: 8,000 unique views per month (to start) Second, we will measure the actual use of the poster via the number of a dedicated hashtag used after the website launch as visitors to the site capture their Metro weekend experiences: 1000 social media posts (to start) These metrics will then be used to sell sponsorships, collect grants, and sell additional merchandise to grow the program at each phase.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "In the short term, success for Have A Go on Metro would create at least several thousand more transit riders, taking thousands of cars off the road. But the goal of this program is longer in term: creating a sizable, CicLAvia-style program (which has a 100K attendee rate) to help spark a weekend transit culture and cultivate mass habituation with transit in LA, leading to a shift in Metro ridership. Paired with continued investments Metro is making, we could help LA County be a very different place over the next decade. LA could start resembling cities that reduce their car dependance: healthier, wealthier, more sustainable, more equitable, and more pleasant. And shockingly, it doesn’t take that much behavior change to lead to cascading positive changes: Two examples: -It only takes a 10-20% decrease in car traffic to go from gridlock to flowing traffic. -“Choosing a bike over a car just once a day reduces an average citizen’s carbon emissions from transport by 67%.”",

In 2019, 1 out of every 8.5 County residents were employed in the travel, tourism & hospitality industry, which was all but completely shut down because of the pandemic, leaving hundreds of thousands out of work. The pandemic has also made providing services to the most vulnerable communities, such as those affected by food insecurity a far greater challenge, with a spike in need at the same time as decreases in supply of human resources able to gather to meet demand.",

As these people struggle to survive and make ends meet, they shouldn’t have to decide do they pay the last little bit of money to their landlord to cover rent or do they use for basic/essential necessities for themselves and their family such as buying groceries and putting food on their tables. Accordingly, with support from the My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we can make a difference in the lives of 95 families in great need throughout Los Angeles so that they don't have to make that impossibly hard decision and can weather this storm and get back on their feet.",

Youth will attend weekly 1 hour virtual afterschool sessions (moving to in-person as restrictions allow), where they will discuss past experiences with race, with the guidance of licenced therapists before participating in creative arts activities as a tool for expression and healing. Youth will have the opportunity to create pieces of art and writing throughout their sessions, leading to the production of a zine which will be distributed to the community. Creative writing and improv lessons will be led by experienced instructors that have seen success in related programming. When 3 Lines has led virtual creative arts classes in the past, many youth wanted to discuss issues related to personal trauma, which the instructors felt unprepared to address. Incorporating licensed therapists into the program will provide youth the support they need to move out of their negative feelings into growth and action. THP will also bring their work to the community through contact-free monthly drive-through resource events, where books and groceries will be distributed to those in need.

With key protective factors associated with participation in afterschool programs such as academic support and connection with positive adult role models, THP’s afterschool program will contribute to the positive development of LA County’s young residents. Feelings of alienation and low self-esteem, often experienced by youth of color, are known risk factors for youth. THP’s therapeutic component will allow youth to develop positive coping skills, which they can then share with peers, increasing the mental health of the community as a whole.

But tragically, for many people of color, George Floyd’s death was just another event in a long line of racial trauma they experience throughout their lives. Witnessing or being the direct target of racism is a well-researched determinant of physical and emotional health among people of color. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, racism has a particularly significant impact on youth, including increased rates of infant mortality, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and other mental health issues. The door has been opened for dialogue among youth about race and racism in America, and many have taken to social media to express their experiences and opinions. But this is not enough; safe places must be intentionally created to allow youth of color to express themselves and heal from the racial trauma they experience on a daily basis.",

Qualitative data indicating success was collected through therapist notes and discussions about how the sessions were progressing. Self-esteem among participants was observed to increase significantly throughout the course of the programming, with therapists indicating that youth became more open and confident in trying new things. All participants in THP will complete an evidence-based teen risk and protective factors checklist before and after their 8 week session. Teens will indicate which statements are true for them, such as “I feel good about myself” and “I feel positive about my future”. Improvement will be shown in at least two areas by the end of their sessions, either through adding a protective factor or eliminating a risk factor. In addition, formal research will be conducted by a Psychologist, which will be published to address the impact of THP on youth mental health."

All programs and services provided through this project will be based on Strengthening Families, an evidence-based approach that focuses on building five protective factors in families: parental resilience, social connections, concrete support in times of need, knowledge of parenting and child development, and social and emotional competence of children. Research has shown that when these protective factors are well established in a family, family strengths are increased, child development is enhanced, and the likelihood of child abuse and neglect is reduced.

However, there are still large and persistent gaps for SELA students that include college preparation, access, and completion. These gaps are also on course to widen due to the pandemic with only an estimated 54% of the class of 2022 on track to graduate.

We feel that we have a responsibility, not only to ourselves and our loved ones, but also to our City, and our local artists. We have a responsibility to create space for the community, to provide a sounding board to experience the work and messages of these profound artists. This is a love note to Los Angeles. We want to address the need for cultural vitality, for residents and creatives alike, and come together collectively to heal ourselves with the power of art. The role of art in our everyday lives is much more vital than is realized. Whether it’s a pandemic, the growth of a city, or the nature of institutions, accessible public art has slowly eroded. Our hope is to change this. Our hope is to be a springboard for a new vision. Our hope is to be one part of the solution.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles is a city that is based around creativity, innovation and culture. With the pandemic and the closing of innumerable venues, galleries, and museums, our residents experienced a silence where there would otherwise have been a flurry of creation and excitement as is typical of the Los Angeles arts and culture scene. Our success will be bringing cultural vitality and access to public art back to the residents of downtown Los Angeles. We want to expand the scope of this initial project and to be able to continue to bring public art exhibitions to the citizens of LA free of charge, while promoting Los Angeles to the forefront of culture. Our intended impact is the recognition of this city, and it’s artists, and it’s communities, as part of a vanguard that prioritizes and supports the fundamental nature of creativity and it’s expression.",

The exhibition will run 7:30 pm to 11:30 pm and is free to the public. Curated by NOW Art Foundation, LUMINEX is an exhibition of six internationally acclaimed Los Angeles artists: Refik Anadol, Nancy Baker Cahill, Sarah Rara, Carole Kim, Luciana Abait, and Akiko Yamashita; supported by a collective of community sponsors. Using our Downtown buildings as backdrops, these Los Angeles artists will use cutting edge digital art to reflect upon the past year, re-inspire our cultural connection, and spotlight the healing power of art. This site-specific exhibition will feature six massive architecturally distinct walls within a 5-block walkable radius (W. Pico Blvd, S. Olive St, W. 11th St, S. Hope St, Flower St). Each local artist will transform their site, projecting a different story or “dialogue of light”, using video and sound. These digital installations speak to themes pivotal at this moment in time: voids and shattering realities, inclusion and diversity, the healing nature of water, sustainability and our environmental future, and local-global interconnectedness. Some installations will include live performances, augmented reality, multi-channel video art, and immersive experiences."

An estimated 750,000 Lawful Permanent Residents and 886,000 undocumented immigrants live in LA County, with the majority from Mexico and Central America, while California has 118,000 essential workers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and 473,000 DACA-eligible people — all of whom need permanent solutions and will be affected by immigration reform. With fast-changing policy changes and recent state budget cuts to programs that assist immigrants with legal fees, there is an overwhelming need among low-income immigrants for in-language information, financial support for legal services, and legal advice to navigate options and obtain legalization. Older immigrants facing language and technology barriers especially need support with accessing resources.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "CHIRLA’s Ready to Stay LA project will expand our infrastructure to help immigrant workers, youth, and families in LA County adjust their legal status under immigration reform and other measures. Currently we are working to make this reform a reality by uplifting immigrant stories at the state and national level. At the local level, CHIRLA will use the power of community education, case management, and legal services to move immigrants into legal status so they can work, live, and thrive in their communities without fear. As a trusted resource, we have already seen increased demand for information and services in response to DACA’s reinstatement and the ban of the public charge rule. With recent legislative proposals to create pathways to legalization and citizenship for undocumented immigrants, DACA recipients, LPRs, Temporary Protected Status holders, and essential workers, CHIRLA anticipates a huge influx in requests for in-language resources and legal aid in the coming year to help immigrants understand policy changes and access the benefits of immigration reform. To meet this demand we will expand our capacity to provide services through a community-centered approach: hiring more staff to offer individualized assistance and legal consultations, addressing questions from the community and making referrals via our Immigrant Assistance Hotline and webinars, hosting educational workshops about available legal pathways, and building networks to support immigrants in need.",

Our long-term vision is to build on the infrastructure developed through this project to ensure healthier, more inclusive communities in LA County and beyond, where immigrants can live and seek social services, healthcare, education, and employment without fear of deportation and discrimination based on status. In addition to including immigrants in COVID-19 relief, ending detention and deportation, and advancing the welfare of immigrant workers, CHIRLA’s advocacy aims to open up legal migration and citizenship for 2.5 million undocumented immigrants in California and 11 million nationwide. CHIRLA will also engage immigrants in civic and leadership opportunities to use their voices."

The participants will benefit from our evidence-based psychosocial support group model, which is proven to have positive effects on cancer patients’ anxiety and depression, especially when they had high levels of distress before starting the group. Support groups help patients feel less depressed and anxious, and can even improve chances of survival. Support groups have also been proven to be beneficial for caregivers of cancer patients, improving their self-efficacy for managing patients’ cancer symptoms, caregiver stress and preparedness for caregiving, coping strategies, perception of well-being and quality of life, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and others.",

Not only will every Angeleno have the option of accessing our services, but that option will be for supports that fit their specific needs, with fellow patients and caregivers who share their particular struggles. Our virtual services will only further connect Los Angeles residents who would otherwise have a difficult time attending an in-person meeting, such as busy parents or those with disabilities. The Los Angeles cancer community will be educated and supported, and all who want it will receive free mental health support, which research shows will have a material impact on survival rates and caregiver competency.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "There are roughly 1.8 million new cancer diagnoses in the US each year. 5.42% of the American population has cancer. In 2017, there were 14,600 cancer deaths in L.A. County alone. Each cancer diagnosis brings trauma and stress for everyone involved. A survey of cancer in L.A. reveals what CSCLA already knows: cancer and its associated financial stress is disproportionately visited on Angelenos of color. Black men have the highest incidence rate for all cancers among men, and Black women the third highest. Hawaiian/Samoan women have the highest overall cancer risk for women, and Hawaiian/Samoan men are second among men. Even more discouraging, perhaps, are the outcomes for minority patients after diagnosis. Black patients have elevated health risks from cancer: Black males have the highest cancer incidence and death rates of all major racial/ethic groups, and Black women, despite 7% lower incidence rates of cancer, are 13% more likely to die of cancer than their white peers."

To heal from this trauma, they need stable placements in family homes where they can develop supportive, consistent, and loving relationships with caregivers. However, efforts by caregivers and youth to build strong relationships can quickly derail when they cannot access community-based, trauma-informed supports at the critical moments they need them. Without immediate supports and services, even minor miscommunications and frustrations can intensify and have detrimental results, leaving youth feeling further traumatized and possibly facing another placement change, hospitalization, or institutionalization. Even worse, in many circumstances, caregivers call the police because they lack other, more appropriate options for immediate help, leading to the inappropriate criminalization of traumatized children.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "On March 1, 2021, the Family Urgent Response System (FURS) launched, an innovative new program developed to provide immediate trauma-informed support to children and youth currently or formerly in foster care and their caregivers in California. This cross-sector state and local response system, consisting of a 24/7 statewide hotline and county mobile response systems, is designed to provide early in-home support to children, youth, and families to prevent and address instability. While FURS is now operational, much work remains to be done to ensure its effective implementation in Los Angeles County – where there are 22,000 children and youth currently in foster care (which is more than a third of all children and youth in care in California) – to meet the needs of children and youth currently or formerly in foster care and their caregivers. For instance, barriers and challenges often become apparent after the launch of large-scale programs such as FURS. Therefore, real-time feedback between the field, the county, and the state will be critical to identifying and resolving FURS implementation issues before they take hold.

Close to a quarter of Los Angeles County’s children still in foster care at 24 months have experienced three or more moves (https://ccwip.berkeley.edu/childwelfare/reports/PlacementStability/MTMG/r/fcp/s). Placement changes cause children in foster care additional trauma and make it more difficult for them to develop healing relationships and establish trust in subsequent caregivers. FURS will help improve outcomes for LA County’s children and youth currently or formerly in foster care by promoting healing; preventing moves, psychiatric hospitalizations, and re-entries into foster care; and reducing the inappropriate criminalization of traumatized children, especially children and youth of color who are disproportionately negatively impacted by the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.",

Many have been forced to put their dreams of owning a small business or starting a new career on hold as they have struggled financially during the pandemic. Small business owners have been particularly hard hit; nearly 317,000 small businesses closed between February and September 2020 (UC Santa Cruz). And the US unemployment rate rose to almost 15% last year, worsening income inequality throughout the country. Low-income people are particularly in need of training and support to launch successful business ventures or careers, as they often have difficulty obtaining loans or accessing financial assistance due to low credit scores and poor financial history."

Without this training, many PsyOC candidates might be looked over for employment, but by receiving the training they will be much more competitive in the job market. The impact of training 16 PsyOC goes beyond the knowledge and experience gained by the PsyOC. Clients of color often prefer to be seen by a PsyOC, but there is a shortage of PsyOC in LA County. By training these 16 PsyOC, we are increasing the amount of PsyOC, thus allowing for more clients of color to be seen by someone that looks like them. The benefits of this grant will not end with the completion of this grant. We propose that once our 16 PsyOC are certified in the interventions, in years to come they will be committed to doing at least one training for free to future candidates of the program.

Barriers to treatment, such as distrust in the mental health system in the US and scarcity of same-race therapists, are attributed to this disparity. The National Association of Black Social Workers support this notion, finding that Black/African Americans experience better treatment outcomes when paired with PsyOC. The problem of access to same-race therapists can be credited to the lack of trauma-focused trained PsyOC. In our recent hiring process at LOVS we received 100+ applicants but only 10 were PsyOC. Of those PsyOC, only 1 had post-graduate clinical training. On paper, white applicants often have more clinical training and are frequently chosen for jobs over PsyOC with little or no post-graduate training. This leads to less PsyOC in the field.

We have reached out to trainers from each of the 3 interventions and found out what they charge, which you'll see in the budget section of this application. It's our hope that we may be able to work out a deal with these trainers since we will have so many PsyOC being trained.If we are able to provide these trainings at a lower cost, then we will be able to increase the amount of PsyOC trained, which would give us over 100% success.

This cost as is illustrated in the budget section of this application. Having the worry of cost eliminated, we will be able to produce trauma-trained PsyOC. The pilot program LOVS is proposing is quite innovative and quite simple in nature. We want to train 16 PsyOC in at least 3 different mental health treatment interventions. The three that we have chosen are Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Trauma-Focused CBT (TF-CBT), and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). The reason we have chosen these 3 interventions is because they are centered around treating trauma. At LOVS, we are trauma-informed and provide therapy through a trauma-focused lens and these three interventions are the top trainings as it pertains to trauma treatment. We believe that we can not only successfully provide this training, but we can continue the training for years to come utilizing the expertise and partnering with those who became certified in the year of the grant and thereafter. What is unique about our program is that we will provide this training for free, and require participants to give back to the community by volunteering at LOVS throughout the year and once certified in the above interventions, agree to provide one training to our next year’s round of PsyOC."

    "organization": "Kaimore",
    "summary": "We believe access to the workforce should be egalitarian. Sadly, the real world doesn’t always operate on the principle of equal opportunity. Aspiring workers often face social barriers because of their ethnicity or economic circumstances. To tackle this problem, Kaimore has developed a 16-week development experience filled with financial coaching, workforce training, project-based learning, field work and a final philanthropy project for ambitious individuals to help realize their full potential as community leaders.",
    "goal": "CREATE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Kaimore seeks to address financial insecurity and unemployment. Access to banks, mortgages, loans, retirement accounts, and good financial advice is critical to establishing long-term financial security. However, over 9 million American households lack a bank account. Some 60 million adults use high-cost lending products, around half of whom are African Americans and Latinos, despite qualifying for standard loan products. Households with poor credit history and lack of emergency savings will spend nearly 10 percent of their income on high-cost credit products. Debts disproportionately impact families and communities of color, hindering economic mobility. Unemployment further exacerbates financial instability. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, unemployment rate in January 2021 in LA County was 12.7%. Re-employment and job retention will be crucial to rebuilding Los Angeles in the coming years, and Kaimore hopes to be part of the solution and long-term change.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "Central LA",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "We will host three Career Accelerator Programs focused on addressing low financial literacy and unemployment in marginalized groups with lower socioeconomic backgrounds such as those previously incarcerated or domestic abuse victims. The curriculum integrates introductory courses, case studies, hands on projects, individual assignments, internships, and mentorship opportunities. Weekend bootcamps will cover 1) basic financial coaching on savings, budgeting, banking, taxes, and credit scores and 2) professional development training programs including resume editing, networking, career panels, and utilizing LinkedIn. Over the course of the first half of the program, members will work on case studies that dive deeper into topics of their choice, along with group projects and individual assignments. During the second half of the program, members will conduct fieldworks, participate in internships, or work on individual projects that will help them secure employment in the industry of their choice. During the final 2 weeks, members will use skills learned from the program to host a philanthropic event for their community, benefiting Los Angeles while solidifying their leadership skills. Members from each class will have the opportunity to become mentors for following cohorts and join the growing Kaimore Accelerator alumni network. Ultimately, the Kaimore platform will serve as a bridge to connect those who are in need to who are able to help.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Since our founding, Kaimore has served over 800 low income individuals in 2020 alone through partnerships with City of Los Angeles, LAOC Apprenticeship Readiness Program, neighborhood councils, Family Source Centers, HACLA, and more. Between 2018-2020, 90.3% of our clients reported at least a 25% increase in savings, 87.4% of individuals improving their credit score by at least 35 points, 89.9% number of individuals with at least 25% reduction in debt, and 85% of individuals set and completed a 6-month long financial goal. Kaimore placed 63 out of 84 individuals enrolled in our pilot workforce development program into jobs despite the pandemic. The metrics we use to measure impact include: documenting number of unduplicated at-risk families enrolled, analysis of client changes in financial wellbeing as measured by the pre- and post- service survey, employment rate, and 3-6 months job retention rate.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "This grant would allow Kaimore to positively impact the lives of those that are underprivileged in Los Angeles. The LA Almanac reported that in December 2020, the unemployment rate in the LA County alone was at 10.7%, around 521,600 individuals. According to the United States Census Bureau, the median income for the city of LA is around $29,000. We are projected to increase the number of clients by 90% by 2023, and we would have the potential to positively influence the lives of almost 1,500 low income clients, which is about .3% of the current unemployment population. If they can secure a median wage job through our curriculum at $29,000/yr, then that would be an additional $43.5M/yr for the LA economy. We will ensure more members of our program will be able to reach or exceed this statistic. Professional development and financial literacy is not easily accessible in the current world, but Kaimore is proud to communicate essential information that will effectively develop our clients.",

Thank you so much.” - “Yesterday, I opened my mailbox and found a package in there from you. From the deep, depths of my heart, I thank you. You've saved a life.” - “I lost my oldest son to mental illness that resulted in suicide. Thank you for this tangible way to spread the message about suicide and preventing others from going through what our family has.” (Mother) - This is a great addition to my therapy groups. I work primarily with female survivors of military sexual trauma and see huge benefits in passing the box among the group.\" (Social Worker)\"",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "We are experiencing an epidemic of hopelessness. In 2019, we lost 48,344 people to suicide. There were a staggering 1.4 million attempts. Currently, there is a gap in how our society is addressing this. Our program is innovative because we fight the hopelessness in a tangible way. And we do that by reminding individuals that they are not alone. That there are strangers all over the world who care. COVID has only exacerbated these issues, bringing mental health to the forefront.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "At the heart of Find Your Anchor’s mission is a small blue box. Once referred to as a “mental health first aid kit,” each box is packed with good vibes and materials designed to inspire, soothe, and offer support. This includes a “52+ Reasons to Live” deck of cards, an infographic on depression, a list of resources, posters, stickers, a bracelet, and a letter. The boxes are intended to be organic in the sense that each person can add their own anchors and inspiration to the box before passing it along. This funding would help us launch more FYA boxes to those struggling throughout Los Angeles - many at the lowest point in their lives. $100,000 would reach 6,750 citizens. These box recipients cross all demographics, social classes, and age groups. This program will help us establish deeper roots in Los Angeles (we relocated from Chicago 2 years ago), ensuring that we reach more people who are struggling. The infusion of 6,000+ boxes into the county will help us to create long-lasting partnerships within the community that will extend far beyond this program. For those contemplating suicide, there is an overwhelming sense of loneliness and despair. We wanted something specifically for them. We want those in need to open the box and think “someone cared enough to make this for me” - providing, or sparking, within them a reason to fight.",

    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Since Find Your Anchor provides a physical product, we will track demand for our boxes. We will also focus on data that tells us where the most box requests come from, demographics of the box requesters, geographical data, etc. - but nothing compares to the impact of a testimonial. Throughout this project we will continue to measure success in the form of firsthand accounts of box recipients. However, we will also measure success by the number of school partnerships we create, recurring box subscriptions we receive, and workshops we give."

Media representation will also change. The journey of learning will be documented with style, creating a fresh narrative that celebrates not only our diversity and the pursuit of riding waves but the pursuit of social and environmental justice as well. Education will likewise be transformed with curriculum that includes the history of racist realities along the coast, the BIPOC surf pioneers who fought against them, and the growing movement of people who embody a culture of joyful and defiant anti-racism. By 2050, 10,000 BIPOC surfers will have gained autonomy in surfing, cementing a sense of freedom and inclusion that will change surf culture forever.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Surfing has not escaped the legacy of institutionalized racism. Rooted as a communal and spiritual practice, surfing was received and reappropriated by white colonialism. The ocean and surfing have been commodified in a white led industry that amasses wealth, distorts origins, and centers themselves while disenfranchising BIPOC. The pervasive racism in surf culture has displaced people of color, forcing them away from the coast, from early missionary practices all the way to redlining and segregation. In Los Angeles, places like Inkwell or Bruce’s Beach continue to lack diversity, affordability, and accessibility. People of color are stigmatized and kept from water play by dangerous stereotypes such as the idea that Black people do not swim or surf, or notions that swimming, water polo, and surfing are white sports. The surf industry is one of the fastest-growing action sports industries in the world with a net worth of $10 billion that continues to leave BIPOC communities behind.",

CASAs will help ensure that once youth are enrolled in college, they have the support systems in place to successfully complete their chosen academic programs. CASAs make sure that these young people are receiving all applicable resources, including financial aid, that they are eligible for. They are also often one of few caring adults that these young people can rely on. CASAs trained to work with these young people will: (1) ensure that foster care exit planning is complete; (2) mentor the young adult through the process of accessing available financial aid and academic support, completing their education, securing housing, transportation, job training/employment; and (3) help these young adults gain confidence and self-sufficiency. To achieve this CASA/LA will: (1) Work with DCFS, LACCD and other colleges, universities and post-secondary institutions to better identify NMD youth on campus who would benefit from this personalized advocacy and collect referrals to our program. (2) Recruit and train 50 new volunteers in the first year to serve minimum two-year terms as advocates for NMDs, and 50 new volunteers in the second year.

LA foster care continues to operate as a pipeline into homelessness, poverty and the prison system and will continue to do so until fundamental changes are made to how we care for our community's most vulnerable kids. We believe that an LA in which every young person in child welfare has an advocate and the opportunity to thrive is a safer, richer, more successful LA for all. Every day our team works hard to make this LA a reality. We have determined that there are 12,000 youth in foster care in LA who have an immediate need for CASA intervention.

ETO also allows us to track case progress and measure outcomes. When a case is assigned, the advocate supervisor and CASA examine the case and rate the status and level of risk of the youth on a baseline scale along the three core dimensions: safety, permanency and wellbeing. We then document the initial assessment related to these dimensions, advocacy goals and plans, the degree to which the plan is then implemented, and how the assessment changes over time. In 2019, we hired a Director of Research & Evaluation, responsible for guiding program evaluation and using this data to measure success and change our programs to better serve children and their families.",

Youth must be formally referred (in writing) to the CASA of Los Angeles program to be matched to a CASA volunteer. CASA/LA works with many community partners to better ascertain and define the growing advocacy needs of the children and youth that we serve. These partners work with us to better serve our youth, identifying and addressing the needs of the individual young people we serve as well as the advocacy priorities of the child welfare community at large. We rely this input from and collaboration with these partners to better inform our work and programs.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "For Non-minor Dependent youth (NMDs, or those who have elected to remain in foster care from ages 18-21) who are enrolled in college, the burden of navigating both Extended Foster Care (AB12) and school can be overwhelming. Young people of color are particularly over-represented in this system and frequently struggle to access and maintain services available to them. According to the Alliance for Children’s Rights, only 3% of LA County youth in foster care graduate from college, even though 70% of youth in care say that they want to pursue a higher education. CASAs have already proven to be a tremendous support to NMDs by helping them navigate the gauntlet of paperwork, meetings, and phone calls needed in order to access AB12 services. We need to expand upon this program with help from community partners to better identify NMD youth enrolled in local colleges who would benefit from the personalized advocacy a CASA volunteer can provide, including support of their academic success."

ARTS to provide ongoing hands-on technical support at each school to help with implementation of school-wide arts goals, such as helping teachers design lessons that integrate arts into core subjects. Principal Coaching - One-on-one coaching helps principals build their leadership skills in and through the arts. Artistic Residencies and Community Engagement Projects - TACA will match each school with partner arts organizations to provide two hands-on artistic residency experiences for students during the school year, underwritten by TACA. This may include theatre with the Actor’s Gang or poetry with Get Lit: Words Ignite. In addition to exposing students to new artistic mediums, these residencies also build the capacity of teachers to integrate these art forms into curriculum.

Volunteers meet with PWDs for 3 hours, twice a week to engage in memory care activities. YouthCare was set to launch 3/9/20 but was postponed due to COVID. Last fall, we successfully transitioned it to a virtual setting and continued to serve families from the safety of their homes. Virtual YouthCare maintains the program structure of in-home YouthCare, with several adaptations to better meet the needs of our participants. The sessions were reduced to 1 hour, twice a week to account for the likelihood of lower attention spans of older adults when interacting via Zoom. Student volunteers meet caregivers once a week to discuss the progress through the BrainBootCamp curriculum, developed by UCLA Longevity Center to stimulate concentration and memory. This model is a win-win-win for caregivers, students, and PWDs. By giving caregivers a break, YouthCare improves their quality of life and empowers them to provide better care for their loved ones. By providing students with volunteer experience, YouthCare inspires them to join the fight against AD and increases interest in fields of aging. By providing PWDs with a consistent friendly face, YouthCare fights social isolation and brings light back into their lives.",
    "Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.": "LA is the healthiest place to CONNECT",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "There are 6.2 million people in America with Alzheimer’s Disease, and over 160,000 live in Los Angeles. There are over 11 million unpaid caregivers in America, and as many as half a million in LA alone. Caring for someone living with Alzheimer’s or dementia can lead to financial, emotional, and physical difficulties, therefore leading to other health problems. More than 40% of these family caregivers of people with dementia develop depression, a rate much higher than seen in non-dementia caregivers. On top of this, there are not enough students entering fields of aging to fulfill the workforce needs that the rising aging population requires. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the already common issue of social isolation that older adults face has been exacerbated. Older adults have experienced a disruption in their routines and an inability to meet and connect with loved ones. This affects both persons with dementia and their caregivers.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Virtual YouthCare’s success will be defined by its ability to reach its ultimate objective of decreasing the prevalence of depression in caregivers of PWDs in LA who use this program by 10% after participating in one program cycle. We administer a pre- and post-program survey to determine if participants have successfully achieved the selected metrics. By monitoring levels of depression, we are able to quantify the individual and aggregate impact Virtual YouthCare has made on the participating caregivers. Our volunteers track the PWDs’ progress through the program and make qualitative observations regarding PWD improvement and engagement. Our staff also monitors student satisfaction with their volunteer experience and integrates their feedback into improving the program. With over 80% student satisfaction and over 80% of families returning to participate, we recognize that Virtual YouthCare meets our goals of activating students in aging and alleviating the burden of caregiving.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "The USC School of Gerontology provides a pool of student volunteers. Their professors also serve as advisors for YouthCare. We collaborated with the UCLA Longevity Center to create a memory care program that can be delivered by our student volunteers. Alzheimer’s Los Angeles acts as a referral partner and helps train our students on cultural diversity in the dementia community. The National Center on Elder Abuse help train our students on elder abuse and neglection prevention HFC acts as a promotional and referral partner. They also help train our students on brain health using their AlzU courses. UsAgainstAlzheimer’s serves as our nonprofit’s larger partner organization and helps us find funds for cost subsidies. The USC Family Caregiver Support Center is our main referral partner."

    "slug": "2021/foodcycle-feeding-people-nourishing-communities",
    "yearSubmitted": "2021",
    "organization": "FoodCycle",
    "summary": "FoodCycle believes that there is no reason that edible food should be wasted while people are going hungry. The problem of hunger is not due to scarcity. For 15 years, FoodCycle’s community-based volunteers have recovered food that would have been thrown away by grocery stores, bakeries, farmer’s markets, and restaurants and delivered it to organizations serving the hungry. We use innovative technology to better recover and connect food with vulnerable populations in LA. Our organization works to ensure that people, not landfills, are fed.",
    "goal": "LIVE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "An estimated 40% of all food produced is wasted; this wasted food is thrown into landfills where it releases methane gas, which is known to be 20 times more harmful than CO2. Additionally, nearly 25% of California’s fresh water supply is used to produce wasted food. Meanwhile, nearly 1 in 8 Angelenos qualify as food insecure—that’s over a million people who don’t know when or where their next meal is coming from. The scale of the problem, already enormous, was compounded by the Covid19 pandemic. The food banks and food pantries that we support experienced dramatic increases in the amount of people they served. Furthermore, the issue of food insecurity disproportionately affects minorities and people of color. The lack of access to fresh produce has created “food deserts” in many areas of Los Angeles. By distributing excess food to ensure no food is wasted, we can reduce the impact on the environment as well as feed those who need it.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "In addition to our regular recovery and distribution of excess food, FoodCycle has used the latest in food rescue technology to create “food maps” of LA. We are able assess the capacity of an organization to donate food and we can also use the database to direct more food to areas we’ve identified as food deserts as well as create an efficient mapping system that allows us to efficiently route and distribute food into these zones. We’ve also expanded our outreach to businesses in order to secure additional donations to serve the areas we see experiencing an increased need. We believe that by collaborating with and supporting community-based nonprofits and sharing resources, we can best help expand access to food in neighborhoods experiencing food insecurity. The bulk of grant funds will be used to provide infrastructure to connect new donors to nonprofit partners. We will provide drivers and transportation to pick up donations and connect them with the distributions that we identify. When nonprofits have transportation capacity, we will first work to develop a successful partnership with donating businesses and then work with the nonprofits to smoothly transition over to them picking up directly from stores and other donors. The remainder of the grant funds will be used to identify new non-profit partners and conduct outreach and education to potential donors (that is, we will find more organizations who can either donate food, or use donated food to feed the hungry).",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "FoodCycle has the ability to track the impacts of food recovery in terms of people fed as well as track the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The use of technology, including a food recovery app, has allowed us to keep detailed records of these impacts and show that our existing program has resulted in 1,743,585 meals served in 2020, and 2,092,302 pounds of food waste diverted from landfills, we kept 2,176 metric tons of greenhouse gases from being released as a result of our program. By creating a collaborative network of existing resources and using technology in innovative ways, we were able to grow 1,250% in 2020. We have increased our network of collaborating nonprofits from 34 in 2019 to over 140 in 2020. We anticipate being able to continue to grow at a rapid pace with the support of this grant and due to the local and state new policies that will be implemented in 2021. By continuing to harness technology we can clearly demonstrate our successes.",

By the end of the grant, we will have expanded our services and created a comprehensive food map/database that connects excess food with hungry people. We will have demonstrated a leadership role by reducing food insecurity in LA, but will mitigate climate change through a reduction of food waste. Innovations afforded by this grant will result in less food insecurity, a cleaner environment, and an increased revenue for the businesses that are integrated into these efforts. Community-based organizations will be supported to better serve their neighbors, and will be provided with the important resources they need to help build resilient communities. People throughout Los Angeles will also have more opportunities to volunteer to help support their communities.

We will see an immediate impact with the creation of new ideas during these pop up events. And we will see ripple effects as these new ways of thinking are then taken into participants’ workplaces. LA has an opportunity to be a cultural and economic influencer by prioritizing the development of the skills of the future and actively creating conversations around redesigning for systems and services.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Our society is at a tipping point of broken systems and services that have led us to inequity, injustice, and unsustainable futures. In order to address the urgent need to redesign these, we need new types of skills, new modes of thinking, and new ways of working together as a community. According to the World Economic forum, 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025: including creative problem solving, critical thinking, and empathy, among many others. But we don’t have many spaces to learn and practice all this. In order to work towards meaningful change, we need new educational formats that address the redesign of systems around us, in a way that centers the lived experiences and needs of our communities. We need facilitated experiences that bring together citizens of all backgrounds, skills, and abilities in a safe space to understand the intricacies of our broken systems, and then learn how to innovate new and existing services with an equity-based value set.",

These innovation labs will teach the methods of service design thinking and systems redesign while exploring real-time challenges. Participants will learn and practice important skills required for the future of work, such as creative problem solving, critical thinking, and empathy. Each pop up social innovation lab will result in fully-formed prototypes for new services as well as improvements for existing services and systems. These can then continue on to be tested within organizations, setting measurable goals for each idea. The outcomes are part entrepreneurship development, part systems redesign, part workforce development. The curriculum is designed for accessibility and equity. A special emphasis will be placed on inviting under-represented populations of BIPOC, immigrants, LGBTQ+, and people with neurodiversity and disabilities. Each event will bring together local and global experts in the facilitation of complex problem solving, sharing expertise and examples from other cities around the world which are utilizing these methods. The program supports hosting three cycles of this lab in the next 12 months, focusing on three different industries or challenge areas, to be selected in partnership with LA 2050 and the City of LA.",

This curriculum has been tested in various cities around the world, measuring for educational outcomes, mindset changes, new skill adoptions. We will measure with qualitative interviews of understanding baseline mindsets toward innovation, before and after the event. We will also set individual industry-wide goals for each of the three events."

People are becoming more aware of the damage that plastic waste can cause to the environment, it is still extremely prevalent in daily lives, from packaging to clothing. The plastic used for food and beverage packaging makes up 2/3 of the world’s plastic waste. Flexible packaging is a growing segment of the world’s packaging market. The world produces 78 million tons of flexible packaging film every year. Even though the volume of flexible packaging is smaller by weight and space, most flexible packaging cannot be practically recycled. Flexible packaging isn’t made of pure plastic polymers but rather made by blending several materials. These blended materials make flexible packaging complicated for separation and recycling.",

Our packaging film is 3-4 times cheaper than other bio-based materials (PLA, PHA, PBAT), is at a similar price as LDPE film, home compostable, ocean degradable, heat sealable, excellent water and oxygen barrier, low thickness, and potentially edible. Our technology can potentially apply to any type of agricultural byproducts and surplus food, including plant, dairy, and vitamin supplement byproducts. Our process uses less energy than paper and plastic production while creating 90% less CO2 than plastic.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Children with chronic illness historically experience learning inequities. Families lose access to arts programs provided by hospitals when their children move to outpatient care. Additionally, 60% of CoachArt families in Los Angeles are low income, lacking the resources to afford extracurricular activities elsewhere—especially programs that can adapt to children’s needs and physical limitations. As a result, children miss out on developmental opportunities, face ostracization as the “sick kid” at school, and experience rates of depression 5 to 7 times higher than their peers. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the circumstances for children with chronic illness in Los Angeles County who, due to their greater vulnerability, need to follow stringent precautions and are thus isolated. In the face of stress and uncertainty, children with chronic illness are in need of socialization, play, and safe environments to learn now more than ever.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "CoachArt restores equity in learning for children with chronic illness by providing ongoing, adaptive lessons in arts and athletics at no cost to families. Lessons accommodate special needs, inspire lifelong passions, build self-confidence, and encourage children to remove the label of “sick kid” and redefine themselves as an artist or athlete. CoachArt’s current initiative is to further develop the online programs launched during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 96% of parents reported that lessons were engaging for their child and requested to continue online learning even after Los Angeles reopens—underlying a need for online access moving forward. CoachArt kids’ most common diagnoses are Cancer (26%), Blood Disorders (10%), Respiratory Diseases (11%), and Neuromuscular Disorders (7%). We serve a diverse population of families, comprising 53% Latino, 14% African American, 13% Caucasian, 9% Asian American, 2% Middle Eastern, 1% Native American, and 8% multiethnic backgrounds. Transitioning to an online model provides more equitable opportunities for low-income families in underserved areas of LA. Our online platform CoachArt Connect was originally designed for volunteer coaches to match with a student near them within a limited radius. We are now incorporating a functionality to CoachArt Connect which will allow volunteer coaches to match with students outside their neighborhoods, further addressing former inequities and giving all students more opportunities to learn.",

When a youth enters one of our supportive shelters, they arrive with histories of trauma and few, if any, positive connections. We immediately address their needs in key areas—mental health, education, employment/income, life skills—and as our case management staff works with the youth, a trust is established that allows the youth to reframe their pasts and re-imagine their futures. They envision themselves as college material for the first time in their lives. Or they learn to believe that their most passionate interests can be parlayed into a living-wage job. They also begin to interact with others in the community who can help them realize their goals for adult self-sufficiency. These positive connections—with YES staff and with individuals/agencies in the community—are essential to sustaining the healthy trajectories that are begun while in shelter, and YES’s Staying Strong program guarantees those connections will be cultivated. Our commitment to each youth is for 5 years—most often, 1-2 years in shelter and 2-3 years in the community—and because of that commitment, we are able to work with youth as they confront the challenges that young adults often face. By sticking with them through these early years of their independence, we prevent challenges from becoming crises. We prevent the youth we serve today from becoming the adult homeless of tomorrow.",

We’ve witnessed success as youth obtain their high school diploma or GED and then go on to a 2- or 4-year institution, often the first in their family to do so. We’ve witnessed success as youth complete paid internships, in the process honing employable skills they didn’t know they had. We’ve seen youth save thousands of dollars to create the nest-egg that will help them through unknown future challenges. We’ve watched as youth redefine relationships with family members who were previously unable to provide emotional support. But these developments must be fortified through ongoing, substantive support, and Staying Strong’s long-term structure is essential to realizing lasting impacts.",

For the youth who benefit from our 5-year commitment and the Staying Strong program that sets us apart from other agencies’ work, the short-term impact will be a positive sense of the future as they work with their case management team to address mental health issues, identify and realize educational and employment goals, and learn and practice the types of life skills that result in everyday independence and self-sufficiency.

The system offers few solutions for youth, and as with the adult system, where points of entry are not matched adequately with thoughtful exit strategies, the LA continuum of care fails to meet the challenges faced by youth whose homelessness too often reflects an acute lack of permanent connections.

I feel less alone, and I really feel like I belong in school now.” Charmaine, LAVC Student Parent Helping families build careers is a key lever in disrupting intergenerational poverty. Education is a common barrier to career goals and higher levels of income. Student parents graduate at less than half the rate of their non-parenting peers. For mothers, completion rates within six years are between 8% and 18% (respectively for single moms and moms from two-parent households), compared to 49% for women who are not caregivers. Single mothers are more likely to take a break from their studies due to lack of equitable supports and the financial stress of being a parent. When they do complete their degree, it can take 6-15 years. While student parents are on a tried-and-true path to create brighter futures for their families, their limited financial resources, time, and mental bandwidth mean those goals often remain out of reach.",

LIFT and LAVC will employ an innovative two-generation approach that addresses student parent issues holistically and clears a path to economic mobility for their families. Through one-on-one financial and career coaching and personal well-being supports, LIFT and LAVC are dismantling the systemic barriers that too often prevent student parents from meeting their educational and financial goals. The model we are building will be codified and can be replicated in community colleges across the county. Fundraising has begun to replicate FRC’s at the eight other colleges in the Los Angeles Community College District. Ultimately, this project will blossom into a larger movement that will break generational cycles of poverty and make LA County the blueprint for student success—opening doors for low-income parents to rewrite their future."

In partnership with LA2050, we will award more scholarships than ever before so that more students can experience the transformative benefits of music education. Students will meet their teaching artist either in person or via Zoom for a weekly 30-minute lesson on an instrument of their choice. Students can learn piano, violin, cello, voice, guitar, drums, sax, trumpet, ukulele and more. We also understand the importance of students having their own instrument upon which to practice and perform, so we provide instruments through our low-cost rental program. For only $10 per month, we will deliver a piano to the students’ home and cover all costs associated with moving and tuning. We also provide instruments like cellos and violins in various sizes so that as students grow, we can ensure they are working with appropriately sized instruments. NMS students receive approximately 48 lessons annually. Throughout the year, recitals, community events and performances will give students the opportunity to share their newfound skills and connect to the larger community. Teaching artists serve as mentors and work individually with each student and craft a personalized plan to meet artistic, musical and performance benchmarks.",

Less than 38% of students in K-5th Grade have access to music education through their schools yet we know that low-income students who are highly engaged in the arts are twice as likely to graduate college as their peers with no arts education. Hispanic students lack access to quality arts education as compared to their White peers. Therefore, we remove barriers so that every student can explore their unique journey and gain transferrable skills through one-to-one music lessons on a variety of instruments led by caring, qualified, mentor teaching artists.

NMS was founded in 1914 to lift that barrier and, in 2021, we continue to lift barriers to access and engage connection to experiences that transform the individual student and the collective community. Music education facilitates development in fine motor skills, reading, repetition, and performance. In doing so, students learn how to apply music skills to academic and life challenges. All families deserve the dignity to provide their children with arts opportunities that help shape their identity and goals. Our goal is for all students to have caring mentors lead them through their artistic and personal journeys.",

The 2017 Cal Youth study found almost half of 19-year-old foster youth surveyed had experienced homelessness or housing instability. It is common for young people exiting foster care to also face other challenges like unemployment, unplanned pregnancies and the struggle to find educational and career success. Part of the challenge in addressing the negative outcomes and disproportionate effects of the juvenile justice system in Los Angeles is the lack of information available to the public. Despite pressing need for sustained public attention, budget cuts in local media mean the challenges faced by Los Angeles’ foster or justice-involved youth receive little coverage.

Students in the program complete quarterly assessments that measure self-esteem, self-awareness, sense of community, and the impact they believe they have in the community. Students also provide testimonials that showcase the impact of our work. Here's what some of our students have to say: “Chicas Verdes makes me feel like I’m wanted somewhere. I’m not alone, and I’m enough for being who I am”; “When I put my hands in the dirt, the first thing that comes to mind is how I can change my life to be, just, happier”; “Chicas Verdes taught me that if I truly believe in something, like making a change, it can actually happen”. We also track the impact of the projects students are implementing in the community.

From there, students develop a sense of community and trust among one another. This sense of community and trust is pivotal if we want students to take advantage of opportunities to learn and develop.

Noting the data on LA2050’s website gathered from a report from the California Department of Education, currently 64 percent of Los Angeles County high school graduates enroll in college. Aggregating this data by race-ethnicity shows that 55 percent of Black students enroll in college and 47.4 percent of Latinx. In our localized study, we found matriculation rates for Black male students is at 27 percent and at 35 percent for Latinx students at Azusa Pacific. Existing interventions seem to be largely ineffective in helping the majority of these students succeed in a college setting. Taking into account LA2050’s target of a 90 percent matriculation rate, our research study aims to identify interventions geared toward eliminating college inequities and thus improve matriculation.",

This data will be analyzed to gauge the effectiveness of the intervention on students’ academic success. We will interview students as the year closes to gauge their perceptions of their success, sense of belonging, perseverance, adaptations, and desire to complete a four-year degree.

Program fees align with our communities to ensure that programming is affordable and comparable to other extracurricular activities. We provide financial assistance to anyone in need, so no one is turned away. Our coaches are the most integral part of our success. It is critical to hire coaches who are from the community and not only look like our participants but have experiences that our youth can relate to. 100% of our coaches hired from the communities we work in, 35% are past program participants.

Each session is two hours and includes an educational portion, as well as physical activities. In addition, there will be supplemental sessions offered by partnering organizations. All of the program content and materials is available in English and Spanish. The VIDA! program is highly valued by the Gasol Foundation and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the program was adapted to a virtual model. The virtual programming has been implemented via Zoom since September 2020 and will conclude in April 2021. The virtual adaptation of VIDA! has been a success at maintaining and engaging participants. The Gasol Foundation staff have experience and ability to implement this program virtually if needed.",

Health and Wellness launched in 2014 through a collaboration with the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, a nonprofit that works in partnership with LAUSD. The project has been implemented in Watts, South LA and Boyle Heights. Now we are seeking to expand the program to Compton. We carry out an assessment protocol to monitor the effects of the intervention and successes. We utilize pre and post assessments to assist in tracking outcomes. We collect BMI measurements for both children and adults. The four healthy habits promoted by the project are assessed through scientifically validated questionnaires. Results show adults increased physical activity levels and sleep hours and 49% improved their weight status. Nearly all children (92%) either maintained or improved their weight status and the overall percentage of children with obesity and abdominal obesity was lowered. Also, 54.5% of children improved their diet quality and 35% showed improvement in emotional well-being.",

Our approach brings families into the learning process in an impactful way that results in improved student outcomes. PowerMyLearning determines impact through internal and external evaluations, analyzing state test scores and other publicly available data, as well as administering surveys. A meta-study completed by the Department of Education on family engagement found that, during primary school years, the level of family engagement had a bigger impact on student achievement than did the quality of the child’s school. In a recent study, PowerMyLearning schools outperformed comparison schools in math proficiency by an average of 8.6 percentage points. After participating in our programs, 88% of students in partner schools say they know how to find resources to help them learn things they do not understand in math, and 95% of parents in partner schools become more confident that they can help their child learn.",

The tutor brings their expertise and passion for math, connecting with the student on a level their teacher is unable to. Each student can expect 1 to 2 sessions a week based on need, as well as an optional weekend small group session. Tutors will give progress reports to parents every few weeks and report directly to the program director, who will oversee all tutors. What makes this tutoring program unique is the tutor’s passion for math and their focus on building lifelong studying habits and real world skills.

Success will be achieved when the program also shows an increase in high school graduates from underserved areas, an increase in college bound students majoring in mathematics or another STEM subject, and students who better understand math. At the beginning and end of each semester, students will receive a survey asking them about their attitudes towards math, with hope for a positive increase. Parents will also receive a survey to gauge their satisfaction with the program overall, with the goal of 80 - 100% of parents satisfied with it. Tutors will have end of program interviews with the program director for feedback, adjusting as needed. We’re hoping they express satisfaction as well and see a retention rate above 75%."

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Marginalized and oppressed communities are often invaded, captured and colonized by professional services, robbing them of their agency, self-worth, and belief in their ability to make a change. This deficit model damages individuals by undermining their sense of self and inherent capacities. These negative effects on self-concept have been thoroughly explored where people labeled deficient come to see themselves as less than. These dis-empowering effects are clearly evident in the data about low measures of self-efficacy and hope in marginalized communities. SBCC’s Give Your Gift campaign is a bold response to this deficit model. Oppressed communities have their own culture of wellness and powerful strategies to enhance well-being. They are generous and caring. SBCC believes not in the power of social services but in the power of community strength. As John McKnight wrote, “Revolutions begin when people who are defined as problems achieve the power to redefine the problem.”",

SBCC is laying the groundwork for a new kind of “gift economy,” which reinforces the importance of each individual contribution. GYG is about organizing and scaling a community’s capacity to help itself. Asset Based Community Development (ABCD) is the philosophical cornerstone of building a resilient, connected, thriving community. SBCC’s GYG is boldly solving what John McKnight, founder of the ABCD model, called the social services and professional problem. By building strengths and supporting residents rather than trying to solve deficit-based problems, communities will drive lasting change. After the grant, this initiative will continue to drive a conversation around a shared asset based economy completely owned and driven by the residents themselves.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "SBCC’s GYG is challenging the deficit model and creating a scalable structure to leverage all of the assets, gifts, and talents within a community. SBCC’s GYG drives social change by surfacing, elevating, and activating the assets within individuals and neighborhoods. The first step in this strength based revolution is to empower 10,000 LA residents to discover their gifts and talents through a digital strength finding platform. SBCC’s website and social media will be the primary channels for the two components of this initiative: the first being an opportunity to barter and share gifts within the community. The second is an easy to use, localized resource map in the spirit of Yelp to reveal the often unknown resources throughout SBCC’s LA County reach. Both of these new sections will provide value to residents on their journey towards positive, self-initiated change. GYG scales its digital strength finding through a broad network of partners who are committed to challenging the deficit model. Next, SBCC through GYG will develop a “gift exchange”. The SBCC Gift Exchange will be a communal space that welcomes everyone in with a simple on-boarding question/response wizard that adds them to a community map. Leveraging the platform, SBCC’s goal will be greater accessibility to the vast personal capacity within SBCC's community. The map will be both desktop and mobile friendly with provisions for SBCC community members to personalize relevant mapped elements and information.",

According to a report at the Los Angeles Times, the study showed that about one-fifth of full-time college students who enroll in school do not make it to their second year. No degree and a whole lot of debt. Many of those students are recipients of federal and state grants, as well as other government appropriations that ultimately come out of the taxpayers’ pockets.

Researchers cite parent-family community involvement as a key to addressing the school dropout crisis and note that strong school-family-community partnerships foster higher educational aspirations and more motivated students. The evidence holds true for students at both the elementary and secondary level, regardless of the parent’s education, family income, or background—and the research shows parent involvement affects minority students’ academic achievement across all races including their ability to graduate from a college with a degree. Our innovative program addresses the key issues that causes that residents of Los Angeles County do not graduate with a bachelor's or high degree. 1. Parent involvement in schools. 2.

It is not enough to teach a family in Watts how to ride bikes. They need a safe place to ride and community support to keep riding. Children and teens need to experience alternatives to a life of drugs and gangs. We work with the community to provide safe access for bike rides in Watts and surrounding areas. We organize group rides for children and their families, teach proper use of masks and other COVID-19 safety protocols, bike safety, and bicycle maintenance. We provide helmets, lights, and, whenever possible, bikes, if the parents can’t afford them. We incorporate community service into our rides to reinforce the concept of “giving back.” Giving back increases self-esteem and self-reliance, and strengthens the sense of community in an area that is often overlooked. Our Bike Education and Safety Training (B.E.A.S.T.) classes are open for the whole family to make biking easy and fun for everyone. It also saves families money on bike repair, which helps keep them riding. Our volunteer supervisors ensure that everyone rides safely, obeys traffic laws, and that everyone maintain a safe distance from each other. Due to COVID-19, people are using bikes to commute to and from school and work more than ever. They do not want to risk using public transportation. In the event of another COVID surge, bike rides will cease but we will continue to feed children and families.",

Due to the COVID-19 school closures, children lost almost all of their access to recreation and socialization opportunities. Over 70% of families in Los Angeles do not have safe access to a park or live within a quarter mile of one. Families in Watts are food-insecure and need safe, inexpensive recreational opportunities and a sense of community. Children need bikes, helmets, training and supervision to be safe biking in a dense urban environment. They need to be supervised to ensure that safety guidelines are followed, including social distancing and the use of PPE. They need to meet other children who are not in gangs and they need community support to help them stay away from drugs. Children who are in gangs need to make connections outside of gangs.",

The program launches on April 10th and we expect to have data showing how much our young gardeners have learned during the 6-week program. We also expect feedback from all of our families to help improve and develop the ongoing gardening program. In future courses, students will have the option to join our beginners or intermediate gardening course.

Pandemic restrictions required us to limit our initial intake to 20 students, but we have an 80-person waitlist ready to fill our capacity as soon as regulations allow. Housing stability is essential not only for immediate wellbeing, but for setting students up for long-term success. When survival and safety needs aren't met, individuals have difficulty learning, planning, and thinking about the future. We believe this is a key factor contributing to the fact that upwards of 70% of community college students statewide fail to graduate or transfer.

By providing a thriving transitional housing solution, we set them up for success and prevent longer-term homelessness. By utilizing existing, vacant spaces, we create win-win partnerships that meet student needs, while helping colleges maximize facilities to meet revenue goals and making efficient use of philanthropic donations.

We leverage existing resources through agreements with community colleges and four-year universities that reimagine the use of vacant dorm rooms or nearby campus housing. Opportunity House, our first location, is a converted, formerly vacant sorority house near UCLA. More than provide an affordable option, we create a thriving community. Recognizing that our students often lack financial, family, or social resources, we maximize their time in the shared space with support that promotes degree completion and builds life skills and a foundation for self-sufficiency. Our network of local nonprofits provide healthy meals, tutoring, mental health support, career development, mentorship, and financial literacy. Thanks to our partners' belief in our vision, over the last year they provided services on a volunteer basis to help us develop proof of concept. Now, with strong initial data and growing demand, we can begin to honor these partnerships with formal, paid agreements as we scale.",

In contributing to the transformation of what is deemed as equitable and inclusive, greater steps need to be taken to ensure that institutions and those in office are implementing such a change. By adapting an evidence-informed public health promotora (advocacy) model, credible youth leaders who participate in the Las Fotos Project Digital Promotora program, and who are trusted by the community can create innovative partnerships to gather and share stories, dismantle stigma, challenge misinformation, and share resources.",

To help further our mission, we have begun to establish a studio space for young creative entrepreneurs, which will act as an incubator for their own small businesses and launch pad for their future careers. This process, coupled with the impact of COVID19 on our communities, has surfaced the need to provide a similar space for young creative advocates. Our new studio location also has the capacity to create an outdoor exhibition & community space which would allow for community members to safely gather and host intentional exchange ideas. Our project, The Foto Forum: A Creative Advocacy Space for Teen Girls, will build on our existing Digital Promotoras program which works with youth leaders to use social media, photojournalism, and multimedia to promote awareness of social inequities facing their community. Their projects serve as first-person digital narratives that inform audiences of available health resources and the actions being taken to create healthier neighborhoods, families, and communities.

As we have been running this program for twenty-six years and counting, we rely also on anecdotal stories-both positive and negative, to shape, adjust and tweak future program endeavors, with our goal of always enriching and improving the camper’s overall experience, at every level.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "According to LAHSA’s recent Homelessness Count Report, there has been a 16% increase in the homeless population in the City of LA. Youth homelessness, most tragically, increased by 24%. There is also a staggering number of LA residents who were identified as “rent-burdened.” The stress and emotional toll felt by these children and teens is very profound. Academic work suffers, access to the streets and crime is much more significant, and they are left with very few outside activities that are physically, educationally, or emotionally enriching, inspiring or fun. Couple this with the inequities experienced during the pandemic-food scarcity, limited access to nature and decreased socialization, overall instability- and the child can fall prey to feelings of great anxiety and depression. We provide access to LA's under-utilized parks and beaches, offer our wonderful, free outdoor programs, and help instill that sense of hope in the future again.",

To provide our youth with memorable, life-affirming, confidence-building outdoor experiences, which increases their ability to relax, de-stress, and enjoy being a child again. Outcome #1: To successfully serve over 1,000 underserved youth. Goal 2.): Highlight how easy and accessible are beaches and parks are for this population. Outcome #2: Participants will leave camp with an understanding of how they can bring their families back on their own to enjoy LA's natural backyard-on their own.Goal 3.) Provide a positive and cohesive bonding experience for the participating family-a true outing that can genuinely bring the family closer together. Outcome #3: Allow camp days for families living in downtown shelters the opportunity to participate, so they leave feeling refreshed, restored, ready to face their future with renewed hope.",

These experiences positively impact and form us, bond us with our natural environment, and teach us how to find peace and respite in our very own backyards. LA is filled with such magical, natural places, that many Angelenos have access to without spending much. Sadly, underserved populations often do not have the time or funds for transportation to provide these experiences for their families. Our Camp for All summer camps run in July through August each year. Over 1,000 at-risk and homeless youth will get to enjoy this inspiring program. Our Wilderness Day Camps provide classic camp activities, plus something more:Native Chumash lessons, Wilderness Intensives, swimming, ropes courses, special arts classes and writing workshops. Our Surf Camps are held at LA's classic Zuma Beach, taught by local surf legends who instill a love and respect of the ocean and provide ocean safety and marine lessons. Our Wilderness Camps are set in a beautiful location in the Santa Monica Mountains. We partner with different agencies that serve homeless and underserved youth- including Homeboy Industries, My Friend's Place, Covenant House, LA's BEST-to name a few. Our staff is skilled at both mentorship and knowledge of the natural environment. Our program allows these youth to be kids\" -again.\"",

LAX is a 24/7 operation with 50,000+ badged employees, and approximately 75% of those employees drive alone to work. That's A LOT of cars on the road, and that's why LAWA is launching commuteLAX, a Transportation Management Organization (TMO) designed to help LAX employees find alternative modes of transportation to ease their commute to work.",

In 2019, an average of 97,248 vehicles entered the airport daily, dropping to 46,915 in 2020. As Angelenos ease back into air travel and LAX employees return to work, the airport has a unique opportunity to get ahead of this expected surge. With construction of the People Mover and other airport access improvement programs underway, we have developed commuteLAX to encourage employees to leave their cars at home and use alternative commute options like transit, carpools, vanpool, and active transportation programs. commuteLAX is a monumental step forward to help LAX bounce back stronger than before.

In addition, low income communities are exposed to 25% more than those with higher incomes and LA’s POC are exposed to average levels between 21- 43% higher than white residents. There has been no viable option to replace these vans and there is a misconception that the problem can be solved by replacing them with new electric ones, but often old vehicles stay on the road and there is a high climate and energy cost to produce the new van. A more sustainable manufacturing process is needed and the cost of entry needs to be reduced so that small local organizations, and large fleet operators can eliminate emissions and reduce operating costs while serving their communities.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Maxwell Vehicles has spent 2 years developing a robust electric van solution that will achieve a marked reduction in operating cost, be more reliable with lower maintenance, and as a side benefit will not emit any local pollution. The Maxwell ePro system takes a customer’s existing van and replaces the engine and fuel tank with an ultra-reliable Tesla powertrain and battery making it a zero emissions vehicle with minimal maintenance (tires and windshield washer fluid). Maxwell is invested in helping nonprofits and community serving organizations gain access to this state of the art electric vehicle technology which can preserve their existing capital investment by not requiring them to invest in a new vehicle. The demand is there, now we just need help expanding our production capacity to deliver as many vans as possible. Ramping up production requires large investment in people, facilities, and tools, but once we have this production can scale rapidly, and the shortened delivery times means we improve cash flow and can put more money back into growing our capacity sooner.",

Small businesses and community organizations will enjoy lower operation costs of their transportation operations, and their clean renewed vehicles will stay on the road many more years with an electric powertrain engineered to last a million miles, each van taking an internal combustion engine off the road. Without Maxwell’s system, there is nothing else available or even in the planning stages that will truly be affordable. In addition, no other electric vehicle program will actually remove a polluting vehicle from the road.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "We have had customer owned vans on the road for over a year, and our telematics system allows us to collect aggregate data from the fleet so we can quantitatively calculate how many total miles of operation, how many gallons of petroleum have been saved, and how many tons of carbon and particulate matter emissions have never been created. Since we also have the total electrical energy logged, we can even demonstrate the actual savings just from fuel costs alone. We can furnish this data to anyone interested."

Through a hands on, kid-friendly experience with the recycling process, students will be able to better understand the ramifications of their own waste. The machines can shred plastic waste into smaller pieces that can be easily melted and reshaped. The melted plastic can be shaped into bowls, and cups, wound into hats, or even used as filament for 3d printers. It can also fill small molds with plastic- anything that can be molded can be created, such as combs, small toys, key chains and earrings. The machine is relatively easy to transport which makes it perfect for traveling to different events, and additionally is easy to set up on site. These machines make plastic recycling easily understandable and can be readily operated by anyone, making them perfect for widespread usage and education. By operating the machines, students can both reduce the amount of plastic sent to landfills and gain experience in fighting against the pollution problem, along with gaining a better understanding of the process of recycling, and the necessity for sustainable prevention work. We will adhere to the LA County public health guidelines in every event, limiting group sizes to 12 students at a time,maintaining social distance outdoors, and abiding by strict disinfecting procedures.",

Eventually we plan for expansion by having numerous mobile machines to travel to even more schools monthly, increasing our impact. Additionally, as part of our expansion, a permanent workshop would be created where the LA community could come to recycle their own plastic. Plastic products created from a permanent workshop with the more robust non-mobile machines would be larger and tougher, with a wide range of uses, e.g. tables, chairs, or even durable bricks that could be used to create shelters and donated to those in need With less plastic pollution, our community would be cleaner and safer for all of it's inhabitants, regardless of species.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Gun dealer oversight dramatically decreases the flow of guns into the criminal market. Despite its proven impact, the federal government inspects only 7% of gun dealers per year, and some who are violating the law can go over a decade without an inspection. These dealers are predominantly white individuals from suburban neighborhoods. That these largely white gun dealers can evade punishment for their negligent and illegal behavior--while Black and Brown communities suffer from downstream gun violence and mass incarceration--highlights the racial imbalance of the criminal justice system. Targeting the industry that is profiting from flooding communities with guns, Brady’s supply-side work fights this inequity. Brady has been preventing gun violence in Los Angeles for over two decades. We have two major programmatic priorities in LA. Team ENOUGH, our youth-led program, provides organizing resources and a platform for diverse young Los Angelenos to speak up on gun violence issues that matter to their communities. Our Combating Crime Guns Initiative (CCGI) takes an innovative supply-side approach to gun violence in LA, holding the gun industry accountable for its role in facilitating gun violence. Alone, each of these programs is critical and impactful—but together, they can create a citywide movement. We seek to bring together Team ENOUGH and CCGI, piloting a model for youth organizing around our supply-side approach to gun violence that deeply engages impacted LA communities.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Where you live should not determine if you live, and that the color of your skin should not dictate your life expectancy. Yet, more than 25% of the country’s homicides occur in neighborhoods containing just 1.5% of the population--largely Black and Brown communities suffering the effects of systemic inequality and oppression. 90% of guns recovered in crime are traced back to sales by just 5% of gun dealers. These crime gun dealers engage in illegal and negligent behaviors that divert guns to the criminal market, prioritizing profit over public safety. These actions flood impacted communities with guns, and the ubiquity creates the problem—it’s akin to attempting to stop opioid addiction with opioids available on every corner. To combat the epidemic of urban gun violence, we must reduce the supply of illegal guns driving urban homicide and gun crime. Brady is the only national gun violence prevention organization leading this supply-side approach.",

Demographics of chapter members will also be tracked; we hope to see increases in socioeconomic and racial/ethnic diversity of the LA chapter throughout the grant period. --Drive community awareness of supply-side solutions: We will hire a program evaluator to assess overall project impact. Exact data collected will depend on initial assessments of the evaluator, but changes in community awareness of the supply-side approach will be evaluated. --Implement supply-side solutions that will make the city of Los Angeles safer: We will track supply-side solutions implemented in Los Angeles and the surrounding area.",

In fact, research shows that shutting down a major source of crime guns can significantly reduce crime in a city for up to 18 months. Brady has identified and created an online map of the most high-risk gun dealers in the LA area. We have strategized local supply-side actions that can be taken to combat gun violence. But to disrupt the supply of guns, we must engage impacted communities in our fight. We envision an LA where diverse young people are provided with the tools needed to hold the gun dealers that feed the persistent gun violence they experience accountable, and empowered to advocate for local supply-side solutions. In the long term, we see a city with decreased gun crime and incarceration and healthier, stronger communities.",

For the second cohort of students in 2022, the firm is targeting students throughout Los Angeles County. As the program begins to scale, the firm will then work with high school students to introduce the career of project management and encourage students to start to dream at an earlier stage. As our firm reaches more young Black women in Los Angeles, we believe that through each woman a career is started, a family is impacted and eventually a whole community. Our vision is to increase awareness of the project management career path, provide training, mentorship, and applied learning experience to Black women, and support these women along their educational and career journey.",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "For centuries, Black women and their struggles have been overlooked. Black women have been put last in every movement and scholars say Black girls are still seen as a footnote. In 2014, President Barack Obama announced a national initiative called My Brother’s Keeper to improve the lives of young Black men. A few months later, Kimberle Crenshaw, a professor and scholar of race theory, wrote an opinion article titled “The Girls Obama Forgot.” Black women need workplaces and experiential learning opportunities where they are a priority, their challenges are acknowledged, and their authenticity is celebrated. These women need career paths, professional experiences, and life skills to break the poverty cycle and achieve a prosperous life. Black women earn $0.63 for every dollar earned by white men, highlighting the income inequality in our country. Black women not only need supportive workplaces, they need opportunities to earn fair wages and tangible skills to advocate for equal pay.",

Individuals with PMP certifications work across various industries including consulting, healthcare, engineering, banking, construction, and IT. By 2023, 80% of organizations will utilize a project, program, or product management office to deliver outputs. On average, these individuals earn a 22% higher salary compared to those without a PMP. The Summer Internship is a 10-week program introducing students to PM and the world of business. The students will complete the course work to earn their Certified Associate in Project Management Certification and gain applied learning experience through supporting firm projects. Students will be offered the opportunity to join the firm’s Associate Program. The Associate Program is offered year around for graduates of the Summer Internship Program or postgraduate students. This program is designed to support firm projects and provide students with work experience on the pathway towards earning their PMP Certification and/or to gain professional experience and transferable skills.

Unfortunately, nationwide only 29% of teachers are highly satisfied by professional development offerings, and this concern trickles down as it directly affects students' learning. This effect can be seen in LAUSD’s high dropout rate of 13.6%. The success of our program will manifest itself in reinvigorated LAUSD educators and lower student dropout rates across the district."

The housing emergency in Southern California, and its disproportionate effects on the most vulnerable Angelenos, comes to an end. Everyone believes access to health care is a human right that translates into full, inalienable coverage. Government agencies provide equitable access to health care for all Californians, regardless of status and no one would ever be removed from coverage. Californians who need it most have enough income to afford basic necessities and save for long-term financial security.

Decisions made by our courts and public officials now will have long-term impacts on the social safety net for hundreds of thousands of Los Angeles residents—for better or for worse. Western Center focuses on the more than six million Californians with low or no income—nearly two million in Los Angeles County alone—living at or below 125% of the federal poverty level. That is a number that, unfortunately, is growing due to the unprecedented health and financial impacts of the pandemic.

Our 2021 docket addresses issues of eviction defense as we move into recovery from the pandemic, discrimination against tenants, barriers to getting and keeping General Relief for people with mental disabilities, and medically fragile children being denied the Medi-Cal skilled nursing care they are entitled to. ADVOCATING FOR ANTI-POVERTY LEGISLATION We fight for legislation related to health care, hunger, affordable housing, economic empowerment, and public benefits. We also oppose harmful legislation and educate lawmakers and other stakeholders on behalf of those living in poverty, and help establish new laws, improve existing laws, and challenge the development of laws that diminish resources and opportunities for vulnerable Los Angeles residents. EMPOWERING LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS Defending the rights of every Los Angeles resident living in poverty within courts, public programs, and government agencies is complex and technical.

COVID19 has disproportionately impacted women’s employment, hitting hardest many women, decreasing overall working time as women juggle the demands of caregiving (homeschooling, childcare, caring for sick family members) and employment. Never has the need for female networking, in new spaces, felt more urgent. No matter the number of attendees, at Table for Ten, each networking group is capped at 12 maximum, to encourage intimate, meaningful and memorable interactions, and minimize stage fright or fears. We believe that nobody was born good at networking – it takes practice. Currently, attendees have to purchase tickets, which may be a barrier to some women. With the grant, Table for Ten would create annual memberships for women throughout LA2050 at a heavily discounted, nominal rate to allow more women to join. A nominal fee is preferable to offering free tickets. Experience shows that when something is offered for free, it fails to inspire commitment. We want women who are serious about their long-term growth and are willing to learn and transform. A nominal annual membership fee allows women to feel they have some skin in the game. With a grant, we would also reach out to influential and powerful men who are supportive of women's advancement and invite them to lead tables.

Women have traditionally been excluded from formal and informal male networking. According to Forbes, ‘Many women don’t want to attend events after work, because they want to get home to be with their families (since women are still the primary caregivers).’ A 2019 study by the Kellogg’s School of Management, even when women attempt to network, showed that it didn't move the needle, because what they need is other women. The study also showed that women who form a strong, close professional network with other women are nearly three times more likely to get a better job than women without that same support. Promoting women is not simply a diversity issue – it’s an economic one. According to McKinsey, $4.3 trillion could be added to the economy if gender parity were reached by 2035.",

But capacity-building and true change takes time. We predict that progress for attendees may not be measurable for 5-10 years from now. However, we intend to measure impact by tracking the increase in attendees who are minority women, disabled women, first generation immigrants, and LGBTQ women. Women in these groups are disproportionately affected by lack of access to leadership, and stand to benefit most.

Alumni leadership in our DNA: Since the end of our first year, every COOP cohort has been led by alumni captains that serve as near peer coaches.

We know social capital plays an enormous role in the labor market with employee referrals being the largest source of hiring for employers and the most transformational (4-14x more likely to be hired with a referral) for candidates. If we want to revitalize higher education, we have to find ways to incorporate social capital building into the college-to-career experience, particularly for underrepresented populations.

With almost 400,000 Black and Latinx college graduates (NCES) entering the workforce every year, this underemployment crisis only stands to grow. This is a recipe to deepen national trends of downward mobility and wealth inequality for people of color (WaPo). Furthermore, informal relationships dominate our labor market. Referred candidates are nine times as likely to get hired (LinkedIn), and currently only 30% of employee referrals go to people of color (Payscale). We have learned that a Bachelor’s degree is necessary, but not sufficient. We need connections and referrals as much as skills. Ultimately, a labor market powered by relationships will reinforce the status quo.

COOP serves as connective tissue between universities and employers looking for diverse and qualified candidates. More importantly, COOP connects underrepresented college grads to each other.

We facilitate cohort bonding throughout the program. Captains: Each cohort is led by a team of four captains, returning COOP alumni who serve as coaches (in addition to busy day jobs). Captain teams teach 100% of COOP’s 200-hour curriculum, and they are the hallmark of COOP’s model. Curriculum: We design our curriculum with input from leaders and practitioners at our industry partners. The curriculum is divided into three parts: Head, Heart, and Hustle—digital “hard skills,” professional “soft skills,” and the grind of the job search. Connections: Finally, we work with employers to interview and hire COOP candidates.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "We will reduce income inequality and increase community wealth by creating locally, democratically owned and operated businesses that empower more Los Angeles residents in the low income neighborhoods. A worker cooperative structure recirculate wealth within the community and brings more stability to businesses. Members in a cooperative can routinely join or leave the business without dissolution. Worker cooperatives are resilient and flexible in uncertain economic environments. The democratic structure of a cooperative ensures that it serves its members’ needs, putting people before profits. The equation used is 1 worker:1 vote:1 share, which means worker-owners control the decision-making process and share the wealth. An economy based on worker cooperatives helps build a more equitable and stable community. We will be developing worker cooperatives in South Central LA where communities of color (POC communities) need a greater equity share in the Los Angeles economy.",

    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "Los Angeles will have a stronger more engaged business community that pays taxes into the local tax pool because we will increase the number of Los Angeles residents that are business owners and increase the equity that Los Angeles residents have in our local economy. Worker cooperative businesses strengthen our communities through broader democratic ownership and control of business and jobs. It builds on local talents, capacities and institutions, rebuilding capital to strengthen and create locally, democratically owned businesses that are anchored in place.These structures and models are part of a growing system that aims at improving the ability of communities and individuals to: increase asset ownership; create anchor jobs locally by broadening ownership over capital; help achieve key environmental goals (including decreasing carbon emissions); expand the provision of public services by strengthening the municipal tax base; and ensure local economic stability.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "One quantitative metric would be the incubation of at least one new cooperative business or conversion of existing businesses per year for the next decade. These new worker co-ops will support subsequent businesses and be supported by existing businesses to build a network of worker-owners. A consequent metric would be the increase in average wages, with cooperatives providing better and more consistent pay to workers. Additionally, the literature shows that cooperatives lower the unemployment rate where they are deployed and provide greater job security in times of economic downturn, so we anticipate more stable employment for our workers. Success is also measured qualitatively in the social equity of a circular economy that empowers members of the local community who have democratic control over their economy. This recirculating wealth will allow other businesses to benefit from a more vibrant economy and the city’s tax base will grow to provide services.",

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "We are establishing a worker cooperative business developer by first working to develop a worker cooperative bakery as part of the Downtown Crenshaw development project. During this initial program, we have engaged the assistance and support of the Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives to recreate their business model in Los Angeles. WORCS will become a business services and development hub for a series of worker cooperative development projects starting with this initial project, a cooperative bakery in the Crenshaw district. In a worker cooperative, all the workers are owners and learn to manage the business democratically. This has proven to increase the income of the workers as well as engagement and equity share each worker has in the community and the economy. A study by The Democracy Collaborative found that worker cooperatives can increase worker incomes by 70 to 80 percent. Worker Cooperatives will stabilize our economy because they are more resilient and flexible. Studies have found that worker cooperatives have a 29% smaller chance of closure after controlling for variables such as industry. Communities around the world, such as Mondragon Spain, Emilia-Romagna Italy, and Preston England, by adopting the strategy of an economy built on worker cooperatives, have proven to recirculate wealth in those communities, benefiting all types of local businesses and residents, significantly decreasing unemployment, increasing the standard of living.",
    "Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.": "Our coalition partner, Downtown Crenshaw Rising, is currently sponsoring community member trainings in workplace democracy with an average attendance of 40+ residents with the goal of recruiting the first cohort of worker-owners for these worker cooperative business developments. Downtown Crenshaw as a part of the Liberty Land Trust will determine a location for the worker cooperatives businesses incubated by WORCS. Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives has a 30 year successful history of developing worker cooperative businesses in the Bay Area including 6 bakeries. Arizmendi is providing business development support services for this project. The Arizmendi network includes cooperative businesses and a business support hub that we plan to recreate this ecosystem in Los Angeles."

Despite these numbers, we know there is work to do to continue to provide direct access and care for Angelenos experiencing homelessness. LA2050, by helping us fund 2 new shower sites, can help expand access to those 66,000 individuals. In the long term when our work is successful, we will be able to not only provide individuals experiencing homelessness with showers, but dignity that showers can entail.

    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "With the Shower of Hope, we believe in the importance and power of having access to a shower for not just sanitation and health purposes, but in building a sense of self-respect and dignity that is critical to building a path out of homelessness. Working within the communities we operate in, we ensure that every unhoused guest who comes to our shower sites has access to meals, clothing, showers, hygiene items, and most importantly, case management. Through our 25 community resource hubs, rather than an unhoused individual having to navigate a difficult network of public transportation and service centers, our community hubs serve to bring the services, hygiene and dignity to our unhoused Angelenos. A $100,000 grant would allow us to open two new community resource hubs in service deprived areas of LA County allowing us to serve an additional 80 Angelenos weekly."

Those who receive support are less likely to fall into destructive old habits and behaviors like substance abuse, gang affiliation and criminal activities. The recidivism rate in California is approximately 62%; it is 10% among TAGPP alumni.

    "yearSubmitted": "2021",
    "organization": "Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (Cast)",
    "summary": "Youth survivors of human trafficking in Los Angeles have experienced unimaginable trauma but many service organizations are not able to meet their unique needs. Cast's Emergency Response team responds to victims of all ages in crisis, ensuring their safety and stability with food, clothing and connection to housing and medical care. To better serve youth survivors, Cast wants to hire a Youth Emergency Response Case Manager who will support youth survivors at a very vulnerable stage of their recovery from their experience: the start.",
    "goal": "LIVE",
    "projectRanking": "Submitted",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Cast is proposing to use a LA2050 grant to cover the cost of a full time Youth Emergency Response Case Manager who will be dedicated to attending at least 100 youth survivors in crisis over one year. They will also be responsible for outreach activities specific to youth survivors, for example by working as Cast’s direct services liaison with DCFS. The Youth ERCM is a new role for Cast and would work across the Youth and Emergency Response programs. They will focus on responding to hotline calls from youth in crisis (until it safe to do so, this will place remotely. Under normal circumstances, staff physically meet survivors wherever it is safe to). They will then provide them with immediate services that meet their urgent needs such as food, clothing, shelter (Cast has an emergency shelter for over 18s) and access to medical care. The focus is on stability and safety. If youth clients wish, they can then receive longer-term case management services and legal services.",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "Ultimately, survivors’ healing and growth is what Cast uses to evaluate our impact. Our Survivor Outcomes Assessment tool looks at 13 categories in a survivor’s life and tracks their progress from ‘in crisis’ to ‘thriving’ while they are receiving Cast’s services. Survivors’ progress scores help to show where and how their service plans needs to be adjusted; it is only when they are 'stable', 'growing' or ‘thriving’ that Cast case managers talk to clients about graduating from our programs - no matter how long that takes.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "A 2018 study reported that almost 10% of homeless individuals on any given night in LA County reported that they had been victims of human trafficking. A 2017 survey found that 19% of the homeless youth population in LA had experienced trafficking. Cast believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of human trafficking and that, as the pandemic near a hopeful end, we will start to receive an increasing number of hotline calls and referrals, including from youth (aged under 24). It is absolutely vital that we have the capacity to meet this need with staff who are experienced in working with very vulnerable youth. Supporting survivors who have recently escaped their trafficking situation in a timely manner has a huge impact on their wellness and safety in the short term and directly prevents them from becoming homeless. Therefore the proposed project will directly affect youth at risk of homelessness and exploitation in LA County.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 100",
    "Which of the LIVE metrics will you impact?​": "Healthcare access",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "County of Los Angeles",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Youth survivors of human trafficking are often not ready for comprehensive case management and need quick, specialized services from youth experts. Cast currently has two Emergency Response Case Managers (ERCMs) who meet with survivors after escaping their traffickers and provide immediate services e.g. housing, food, medical care. They serve clients of all ages and are not experts in the needs of youth survivors. As their caseloads are full, Cast has identified the need to increase the number of ERCMs, especially as the number of emergency responses made by Cast staff increased by 185% in 2020. In addition, Cast is due to commence a three-year contract with the LA County DCFS to be the agency’s trainer on Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Human Trafficking. Due to the vastly increased exposure across Los Angeles, Cast anticipates an increase in hotline calls and referrals for trafficked youth and needs to ensure sufficient capacity to respond."

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "We created a more inclusive community of filmmakers committed to empowering girls and non-binary youth behind the camera with the goal of eradicating gender disparity in the industry. Annenberg Institute confirms the problem: “Hollywood movies perpetuate a lack of inclusive representation of those from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, girls and women, the LGBTQ community, and individuals with disabilities.” In Variety, Dave McNary wrote, “Men comprised 68% and women 32% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on films in festivals in 2018-19.” He added that on films directed by women 72% of writers and 45% of editors were women as opposed to 11% & 21% on male directed films. To end the gross underrepresentation, youth need support and training early in order to penetrate the odds that are stacked against them.

To attain equity, our programs include diverse groups of girls and non-binary youth ages 12-18 and provide financial hardship scholarships. Our 3-week summer film intensive is taught by top professionals, some Emmy-winning, who volunteer in all areas of production providing crucial training. Students form groups in a safe, virtual, collaborative environment creating festival-ready films using smart phones and cutting-edge tools. These films help students gain entry into top film schools and are screened at our virtual global festival providing exposure for this underserved demographic. “The Sound of Justice,” a feature produced in our pilot program premiered at OC’s Multicultural Film Fiesta and was accepted at Denver’s XicanIndie Film Fest. Our monthly workshops allow students to further hone their skills and we are creating an after-school film enrichment program to widen our reach all over LA across all socio-economic backgrounds.

We have made connections with non-profits who are supporting our No-Cost Farmers Market initiative; including Food Finders and Armanda Unified. We are creating a network of vested agencies who will be able to replicate the program. The impact of our No-Cost market can be multiplied exponentially. The low cost of starting a farm on properties owned by local jurisdictions allows for ease of start-up relative to the potential impact of each farm. Pairing produce grown on-site with diverted food waste improves food system efficiency. We envision LA County where everyone has a farm within walking distance. We will create green public spaces that facilitate sharing food knowledge, so that people develop a sense of ownership leading to food sovereignty.

    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "The food access issue in Westside Long Beach is one that plagues many LA County neighborhoods with similar demographics - there is no food sovereignty. Food sovereignty is the idea that people should have ownership and input into the food system, rather than being subject to the systemic and economic drivers that lead to the conditions that create food deserts and geographic disparities. Everyone is entitled to culturally appropriate, healthy food choices that support their communities. A food system should not be driven completely by outside forces beyond people’s understanding or control. Rather, people deserve to understand deeply the roots of their food and to experience the dignity of choice and quality in their food supply. Our innovative approach to food distribution will pave the way towards true local food sovereignty in Long Beach by empowering local residents, especially those traditionally disenfranchised from local food systems, to create the future of food in our city.",

To build food access in a dignified manner while promoting food sovereignty, our program will provide a No-Cost Open Farmers Market to the community where our Urban Farm is located. We are in an area of Long Beach that is considered a food desert according to the USDA, and is impacted by high levels of food insecurity due to low incomes. This program will provide free access to healthy food grown on our farm. We've also partnered with a food rescue organization to divert good food from the landfill. We will also provide recipients with tools to incorporate produce into their diets through nutritional education, cooking demonstrations, and recipes. We will provide information on CalFresh and help with the application process to further improve food access and security. Our Market will be run by Sowing Seeds Of Change vocational program participants, who are individuals with disabilities and foster youth aged 18-24. Thus, our proposed market program will not only improve food access in the neighborhood, but provides employment opportunities to local marginalized youth with historically low employment outcomes. Our vocational program will provide on-going mentorship to our participants to ensure they are able to carry out all the duties necessary for a successful weekly market. Our model will develop community around food by empowering our youth participants to serve as food ambassadors for their community."

    "In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?": "Expand existing project, program, or initiative",
    "Which of the LEARN metrics will you impact?​": "Enrollment in afterschool programs",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "Computer science makes math interactive. Math on some levels can be boring. Our program effectively introduces CS to students, inspiring and engaging them to partake in math. Computer Science and Mathematics are intertwined.We do this by incorporating coding and robotics. Coding helps students visualize abstract concepts in math and builds critical-thinking skills.This leads to a deeper understanding of concepts. Robotics facilitates math through modelling, planning, and execution. Each student is mailed a robotics kit (STEM in a box) and lessons are conducted by a live instructor once a week for 1 hour.We also have a Virtual Academy where students can learn self paced courses on the same platform as LinkedIn learning and Skill share. With our ability to deliver the content electronically through streaming services amazon fire and roku Video on demand. We can deliver to any student, at any place and time. This is a more comprehensive result than a zoom call. Students are encouraged to participate, ask questions, troubleshoot and work together as a team.",
    "Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.": "If our work is successful we are going to see a marked increase in students' comprehensive understanding of math and the erosions of lost math skills due to the covid 19 school closures. An increase in common core math standards in undeserved and under-resourced communities. More inclusion of children wanting to have careers in STEM. With success we can expand this initiative throughout Los Angeles County school districts Within five to seven years Los Angeles County could have home grown STEM professionals from the inner cities of Los Angeles county. We already have had success with our first high school interns. One was accepted into Caltech Majoring in computer science,the other intern was accepted to Cal Berkeley. This will lead to a more sustainable future for Los Angeles with high-tech professional jobs.It will also lead to more inclusion in under-resourced and underserved communities. That will reverberate throughout the county of Los Angeles.",
    "In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?": "South LA",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "Most students showed growth in reading and math achievement since the onset of COVID-19 disruptions, but math growth was lower than in a typical year. A higher percentage of underserved and under-resourced communities of African Americans and Latinos need equitable access to high-quality math instructors. Damage cannot be calculated because there are scores of students not attending online classes for various reasons. There is an urgent call for intervention in these communities because of the severity of the problem. Disillusionment with education will lead to low academic performance in high school will stem from the covid-19 school Closer and Interrupted learning. Even if returning to school this fall is successful, we are looking at a gap of 2 to 3 years before interrupted education is repaired.",
    "Approximately how many people will be impacted by this project, program, or initiative?": "Direct Impact: 4,800",
    "What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?": "All parents and children are entered into our database and contacted at least once a year. We track students progress with exam scores from the challenges that are fed into an algorithm which determines the students' weaknesses. This AI (Artificial intelligence) engine will generate a particular course of action to help the student in math. We tracked the children from elementary school through Middle School all the way to high school to keep tabs on their progress. We employ a quality-improvement process that is continuously upgraded and reformed by the board of directors and the engineering community. Our board of directors are composed of credential teachers in the area of STEM and special needs."

In this capacity, I think it is about creating opportunities to acknowledge all the members of our community and helping them to find ways to celebrate who they are.” This school principal’s “exit ticket” following a “Building an Anti-Racist Arts Classroom” PD, led by LA Director Rubi Fregoso, speaks directly to how ETA is collaborationg with our schools to address inequity. Furthermore, it points to our collective vision of what we can achieve with the support of LA2050. Assessments and measurable impact indicators are fundamental to the ongoing evaluation of each of ETA’s programs. PLC Pre-and post-surveys, AIP self-reported surveys and exit tickets address the outcomes pegged to our program benchmarks, including self-awareness, social awareness, and connectedness. For example, following virtual summer programming in AIP, 95% of students said they felt a stronger connection with each other and their mentors.",

    "Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.": "LA is the best place to CREATE",
    "What is the problem that you are seeking to address?": "2020 was a year filled with unprecedented pain, anguish and challenges for public school communities. Dysfunctional and inadequate systems, built upon a legacy of racism and classism, unable to cope with the demands of virtual learning, only amplified the inequity in arts education that our educators, students and families have struggled with for many years. Compounded by the personal challenges facing our community due to COVID-19, stress, trauma, and depression have surged in the last year (1/2 of Americans report harmed mental health according to a Kaiser Family Foundation Poll). The arts, and the social emotional skills they provide, are essential to address this ongoing trauma. Yet, only 40% of LA County students are enrolled in an arts course. The pandemic has illustrated how necessary arts education, in combination with trauma-informed practices and Transformative Social Emotional Learning (TSEL) in school communities are to engaging and supporting students.",
    "Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.": "In 2021-22, ETA will extend components of its existing programming to address the systemic problems intensified by the Pandemic. ETA is unique in its program design which is flexibly customized to each school, their community, and their particular goals. With the support of LA 2050, ETA will build community amongst art teachers through paid Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) where they support one another through iterative problem-solving dialogue related to distance or in person arts learning. Professional Development sessions, developed in collaboration with community arts partners, will increase the capacity of teachers to center black and brown students’ identity, skills, culture and community, and nurture creative and critical thinkers by incorporating Anti-Racist and TSEL practices in their arts discipline. The Arts Internship Program (AIP) places high schoolers as paid interns in mentorship with professionals working in the arts to support connectedness, preparedness, and authentic participation. The 2050 grant would support expanding Learning Labs and Mentor Training where participants build TSEL competencies in self awareness, self-advocacy, and social awareness. This new programming will be created in collaboration with ETA’s community arts partners."
