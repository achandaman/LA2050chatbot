In 2017, nearly a third of LA residents reported missing over a week of work due to mental health issues, and the Kaiser Foundation has shown that only a third of California's need for mental health is being met by the current provider landscape. Since our health centers are often the only source of care for the majority of our patients, we believe Planned Parenthood is uniquely positioned to become both a safe space and a safety net for not only sexual and reproductive care but also for mental and emotional well-being.",

    "Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.": "We were founded in 1933 by a pioneering woman doctor and fourteen visionary women, who were united in their belief that everyone in LA should have access to contraception, regardless of income or insurance. We're one of the oldest Planned Parenthood affiliates in the nation, which is testament to LA's longstanding dedication to women's rights and public health. When our first health center opened 85 years ago, dozens of publicly funded clinics across the city had shuttered due to the Great Depression. Indigent women and families all over LA County had been cut off from sexual and reproductive care, and our founders worked tirelessly to correct this inequity. This was our guiding ethos then, as it is now: Everyone should have access to health care--no matter what. During our early history, we provided diaphragms and sex ed from a small Pasadena bungalow. Today, we're the most trusted and sought-after provider of sexual and reproductive care for 24 communities in Northeast LA and the San Gabriel Valley, serving 65,000 patient visits each year and delivering over 15,000 opportunities for sex education.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​": "At our Planned Parenthood affiliate, every department tracks and reviews dashboard indicators in each area of our strategic plan. This evaluation is done quarterly and then assessed by the Board of Directors, which convenes at least ten times per year. On a monthly basis, our Leadership Team also reviews 51 metrics pertaining to: Health Center Access; Revenue; Service and Quality; Compliance; Outreach and Marketing; and Finance. Each month, we track whether or not we are on-target or within 5% of our goal, and if we are not, we respond intelligently. Health center managers and their staff undergo a similar monthly performance evaluation process on 40 metrics pertaining to: appointment access, quality indicators, patient satisfaction, and financial performance. Although our affiliate is only a mid-size network of health centers, one of our profound strengths is that—because our leadership and health center staff convene so frequently to communally analyze the organization’s most current results—we can quickly address the problems, act on the needs, and adapt to the trends revealed by our data. As part of this pilot, we'll incorporate behavioral health metrics into both the evaluations performed by our Leadership Team and our health center staff."

Later this year, she will be announcing her candidacy for the school board. Dina attributes her interest in political activism and early childhood policy to SMC’s ECE faculty, who involved her in numerous local and state level ECE policy campaigns in her time here at SMC.

Through a contract with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), T4T.org provided classroom arts programming, using materials from a variety of manufacturing operations. Over the years, the T4T warehouse evolved from a simple \"market\" into a hub of teacher/student/parent creative interaction as T4T continued to develop educational programs with the help of prestigious partners such as NASA to address emerging classroom needs in science and technology. In 2015, T4T.org’s Resource Cart was transformed into what is today 2BCF’s signature program, the STEAM Lab Makerspace. A second transformative change occurred when Brent Bushnell, Co-Founder and CEO of Two Bit Circus, invited T4T to participate in the first STEAM Carnivals in San Pedro and San Francisco. Following the STEAM Carnival, Mr. Bushnell joined the T4T.org Board. In 2017, Two Bit Circus formed the Two Bit Circus Foundation which merged with T4T.org under T4T’s EIN, propelling the new organization into an aggressive new growth phase. Today, 2BCF’s STEAM Lab Makerspace can be found in schools throughout So. CA, Fresno, and Tennessee with an eye to the rest of the country.

As an undocumented youth in LA, he worked throughout high school to help his family stay afloat, and often found himself responsible for caring for three younger siblings. Luckily he found the time between school work, home responsibilities, and jobs to participate in STOKED - a sanctuary in which he could decompress from the stresses he encountered on a daily basis, and channel his determination to overcome adversity and learn to skate, snowboard, and surf. Through his participation in STOKED, Erick became aware of his unhealthy lifestyle of poor eating habits, too much screen time, and limited physical activity. Inspired by STOKED and our commitment to overcoming obstacles and building resilience, he committed to being more active, eating more healthy foods, and dedicating time to play with friends that were also in STOKED. For him, these sports were never anything he saw himself being able to do, so to have an avenue to find yourself on top of a mountain or catching a wave in Malibu was monumental. He was able to learn from adult mentors that balanced their life and work with healthy amounts of play and activity. He was able to see himself being more than what he saw around him at his school, job, and home; and ultimately was awarded for such bravery by winning the Student of the Year Award in 2018. Having conquered the fear of \"dropping in\" on a skateboard, it was no problem for Erick to become an advocate for other undocumented students to see themselves conquering their daily obstacles. His relationship with his STOKED Coach, Max, was instrumental to his success. For many students, taking advantage of opportunities is a challenge, but for Erick, he immediately saw value in STOKED sports programs and college and career readiness programs. He had a safe place to try new things and learn with people who truly cared about his future. Erick is the first in his family to go to college, so he tells his story so other students can see themselves doing the same.",

Recognizing that not all communities have the same access to the resources that inspire successful futures, Spark aims to equalize the playing field for students by connecting them to meaningful workplace mentorships throughout Los Angeles.

We highly value evaluation and are constantly looking for ways to enhance our programming. Spark evaluates program effectiveness based on students’ academic and social-emotional development in areas associated with high school, college, and career success. Our rigorous evaluation includes the collection of quantitative and qualitative data from students, mentors, and teachers at three points throughout the program as well as data collected and shared from school districts. This 360-view assesses student progress toward target outcomes, such as the ability to develop the skills, connections, and engagement needed to graduate from high school and continue down a path of academic and career achievement.",
    "Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.": "Spark was founded by two educators in the Bay who saw a troubling gap between schools and their surrounding communities. Middle school students were confined to classrooms and disengaged— a world apart from the wealth of resources that neighboring businesses had to offer. Spark was founded on the belief that all young people should be inspired to explore who they can become, and all adults have a role in supporting them in that journey.",

    "How will your project make LA the best place to LEARN?": "Spark is leading The Possibility Movement, a national call to action for community members to stop the cycle of poverty by breaking down barriers that exist in their very own backyards. 1.2 million students drop out of high school every year in the US. The path to dropping out begins well before then. Research shows that middle school is a troubling turning point for students when up to 60% become chronically disengaged. This lack of engagement is often exacerbated by under-resourced schools and perceived lack of opportunity. Through the powerful combination of mentoring, hands-on learning, and access to resources, Los Angeles Unified School District students participating in Spark develop the motivation, skills, and relationships necessary to successfully transition to high school, a significant contributor of a longer-term trajectory of success."

The year was 2012, and that lucky year, I requested WIF to introduce me to their Netflix contact, which they did without hesitation. Netflix was a relatively new player on the block back then. What resulted was a distribution deal from Netflix and an introduction to a bigger digital aggregator. The film was the first Pakistani film to be on Netflix, be in the permanent selection of the Library of Congress and 3 years later, it is still running in festivals and on SVOD platforms around the world. It was more than the money that made the Finishing Funding so important. It was the symbolism. What we needed desperately then was validation. Women In Film’s ‘yes’ broke the pattern of ‘no’s.’ In a lot of ways, that was both the tipping point of the journey of the film - and for me - in the business. Don't ever underestimate what organizational validation and support means to an independent film. It takes a lot to float in the indie world, and every chance of support can help keep talented filmmakers above water. Take a risk on us and we will take the risks that cinema needs to stay alive and thriving.\"",

Of the few data points available for how women in the U.S. and Los Angeles travel, we know this: Women travel in similar modes than men, but travel shorter distances and make more trips.

Lastly, children and families have had to temporarily relocate far from their prior residences, forcing long and costly commutes to get to school, work, and appointments. While the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responds to California disasters, their prolonged administrative process can take months to transition impacted families into long-term assistance programs, and too often youth and families must fend for themselves, without timely access to critical resources."

Soon after the opening of our retail location, we created the non-profit The Urban Warehouse to expand our reach and impact. Over the past 12 years, we have worked with other non-profits and organizations to allow our members to take part in projects and events that would otherwise be outside of their financial reach. Our primary mission and ultimate goal is to liberate our members from the chains of poverty and stereotypes that come with being a part of low-income communities like our own. We work hard to instill a desire for a higher education, getting our members past k-12 and into an institution of higher learning is just as important as getting them to master tricks on a skateboard. Everything we do, is for the community. All of our events, from weekly food banks, toy drives, and our after-school tutoring program are tailored to the benefit of every member of our community.",

An intimate gathering of 20 guests were treated to a 5-course Afghan meal and an opportunity to hear Liza speak in English about her journey and love for food. Liza is now Tiyya’s most called upon chef and earns substantial money to help her growing family while she attends college. She was featured in the LA Times / Orange County section, becoming an inspiration for other refugee mothers.

One of his firms had become the leading outside supplier to Apple’s Claris software subsidiary. The foundation grew in 1998 after he sold his most lucrative company to a Cincinnati firm. Young and his wife, Mary Beth, whose kids then were 6-, 4- and 3-years-old, began to take an active interest in philanthropy, supporting organizations impacting quality of life, such as UNICEF, WWF, the American Red Cross, United Way and Salvation Army. As the kids grew older, themes began to emerge -- helping people who don’t have opportunities in life, humanitarian causes and improving quality of life for all. Every year, the Youngs would provide their kids with poker chips and information about various causes and let the kids place their chips on the cause brochures they had gathered as a way of choosing where the family’s philanthropy would go. The family also embarked on hands-on philanthropy. As the kids grew older, they challenged their dad to merge his business, technology and volunteering interests. Young became a board member of a number of local and national organizations, exposing him to another significant volunteer activity. Along with partners, Young in 2007 created UGIVE.ORG, a nonprofit aimed at catalyzing, exciting and empowering the next generation of volunteers. The program expanded to high school and college campuses in 22 states when it was merged with the Muhammad Ali Center. In 2010, Young's son, Michael, a USC grad, created myActions, which with Young's and Michael's friends' help became the leading student-powered college network for sharing sustainable and socially responsible actions. Young became concerned about the systems supporting volunteers, leading in 2017 to the creation of 501(c)(3) Inspiring Service, which turned its attention to creating technology platforms that would better connect volunteers to ways to help in the community where they live.",

    "How will your project make LA the best place to CONNECT?": "Our project is the creation of a digital community-wide volunteer guide (CVG), LA Connect 2050, tentatively located at LAConnect2050.org. This guide will be patterned after our successful CVGs in Ohio and Nevada, where our platforms have become the most popular places for citizens of those respective regions to find ways to help (volunteer). Based on our other successes, we project LA Connect 2050 would, after 24 months of operation, have helped tens of thousands of citizens of Los Angeles County find their way to help, many of whom would otherwise have given up due to the lack of a comprehensive guide in the region. As awareness and confidence in the platform builds based on marketing and staff support from LA2050, we would expect the citizen connections to grow substantially in the second full year, and continue to grow annually for the next 10 years and subsequent two decades. Based on this growth in helping Greater Los Angeles residents find their way to help, LAConnect2050.org will ensure the rise of the Los Angeles region's volunteer rates from the current 2.48 million (24.1 percent of the current 10 million+ population) to more than 8.78 million (65 percent of the projected 13.5 million population) by 2050. This achieves one of LA2050’s major measurable metrics. Volumes of research credit greater volunteerism with increased voting rates and better social and emotional status of participating citizens, for which LA Connect 2050 will also contribute to improving. Critical to the success of the platform will be its comprehension in all geographies, capturing all volunteer-engaging organizations in Los Angeles County. Most volunteer-engaging organizations in the region -- we estimate there are roughly 8,000-10,000 -- will welcome the opportunity to be part of the guide because it will be free. And our online forms make it easy for them to do so. But it will be important to invest resources to ensure that all organizations are represented, regardless of the organization’s ability to create a profile. Key to our success will be high-quality content. One of the first steps to achieve comprehension is to develop partnerships and cooperation from the dozens of nonprofit organizing coalitions -- community foundations, United Ways, chambers of commerce and other similar bodies who can provide quick access and verification that the vast majority of nonprofits they work with gets communication and direction on how to be part of the CVG. We estimate the timeline to get to 75 percent comprehension is about one year. With funding this summer, the site can go live this fall. Our platform supports all aspects of volunteerism, from hands-on work to skills-based to board level, across all causes -- creating a one-stop shop for the region. An ongoing communication schedule with all nonprofits organized by cause on a monthly basis ensures that the platform's information and the ways for which they are seeking help always remains up-to-date."

The school that we visited had 97% of its students on meal support. A Title I school and thus, their ability to donate monetarily or do ‘acts of charity’ is extremely limited due to their socioeconomic background. We showed them a video on the world water crisis where a 13yr old girl has to carry a 40 pound jerry can 3 miles every day -just to get water for her family- and in doing so giving up her opportunity for an education. After the video was over we asked the children to carry a similar jerry can across a basketball court to allow them to physically understand the journey of the young girl they had just learnt about. One of the students came up to our co-founder Serinda Swan and told her how just yesterday she was complaining to her mother about having to carry all the groceries in from the car. She said a lightbulb went off during our curriculum at how lucky she was that those bags contained food. That she could walk to the sink and get clean water and that she didn’t have to give up her education for basic human needs. She said that she had always considered that she was the ‘charity’ but she said after watching our Deedly video she realized that a donation is not just monetary - it’s using your voice, using a dollar as a vote, and using your spending power (no matter how big or small) to inform the decisions of corporations. She understood that with every action she can create change and that was something she was looking forward to doing in the future both within the Deedly curriculum and now outside in her every day life. This is exactly what our founders Serinda Swan and Andrew Resnick had intended on when they created Deedly.

He recounted his trips to county rehabilitation facilities, with relapses in between, recalling that the final time he went to rehab and got clean, “I was surprised I wasn’t dead already.” As Tito struggled with his sobriety, he also found himself living on the street. He described these conditions as leaving him to feel “not even like a human being.”",

Each lesson was 60 minutes and started with a game the teacher would play with the students about colors. Next, the artist conceived project ideas were taught and the students had a great time. It was a huge success to teach our program to the students. The students and the faculty appreciated the extra curricular art lessons that included much play and creativity for the children. The director of this facility expressed how calm the children were after each of our lessons and have already asked us to come back and continue with more programming. We are currently working with 14 artists to create more project ideas in addition to the artists we currently work with who are creating their second or third project idea. We will measure success by surveying the students prior to the program at the beginning of the month as well as at the end of the month.",

    "Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.": "The birth of Crayon Collection is very unique as it originated from solving a systemic problem of wastefulness in America. We noticed that restaurants in America were throwing away over 150 million crayons per year. These crayons are made of paraffin wax and never decompose, damaging our precious environment. At the same time budget cuts in education left art programs to be only in well-served schools despite proof that children with access to the arts performed better in all subjects. Additionally, teachers were forced to spend their personal earnings to outfit their classroom with the most basic school supplies. The Crayon Collection was born after we asked restaurants to collect the still good crayons kid-diners left behind. Each restaurant was then paired with a local Title 1 or Head Start school who picked up an average of 2,500 per month. The schools and the restaurants were never over 5 miles apart so it was a community effort to find a new home for the crayons versus tossing them in the trash. This program then evolved in order to solve the lack of art education in schools as well because we felt that the arts should not only be for affluent children. All children have a right to use their left and right brain to learn. We began to challenge local LA artists who had a masters degree in fine arts and were represented by LA based galleries. The parameters we asked them to abide by simply to create deep art projects that were fun and interesting for children using JUST crayons as the main tool. We asked them to avoid coloring projects that were about staying \"inside the lines\" and the results were powerful. The art projects were taught during class time in LAUSD schools by the artists themselves. We won an award for our work inside the classroom by the LAUSD school board. Now, we seek to support schools in their after school programming so that we can fill in a huge void that they desperately need help with. We are most proud when we hear that the Crayon Collection crayons we provide children are actually the first pack of crayons they have ever had to call their own.",

    "Which of the PLAY metrics will your submission impact?​​": "Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play",
    "How will your project make LA the best place to PLAY?": "We seek to support children attending LAUSD schools who are in need of after school programming at their schools. They are in need of a safe place to play and create while their parents are at work. We will work with the schools that are in the bottom 5% of LAUSD. The student population we will served ranges from 5 years of age to 11 and are kindergarten - 5th grade. Seventy-eight percent are of Latino descent and 8 % are African American. One-hundred percent are living under the poverty line and are on the free meal programs at their schools. There are homeless families included in this population who we will also serve. The schools we will serve will be on a 1 month rotation with 1 after school class per day. We will work with 5 schools at a time and serve at total of 45 schools in the 2019-2020 school year. Each teacher will serve 1 school for the month and then move onto the next school and repeat the curriculum. The classes will be about creative play and opening the children's minds to art and creative expression. The artists we are currently working with will be providing the new art projects. LA will be the best place to play because we plan to also bring the local artists inside the classrooms as often as possible. This collaboration between key artists and restaurants (who donate the crayons) to help underserved schools is a synergy like no other. The change we will make in the childrens lives has already been seen as we piloted the program. Each class begins with a game that varies from Simon Says, or a riddle or a color challenge. Then the project begins and the kids are able to express themselves in ways that are most unique as the project is created by an artist who has high education and ability to create. For example, one artist conceived Crayon Collection project uses crayons to teach a technique called \"Blind Contour Line Drawings\" through a Basquiat-esque project. Another project teaches various shading techniques by Rembrandt. Each day the students will work on a new project and have the chance to hone in on their abilities with their own pack of crayons that were donated to them but Crayon Collection. We will survey the children about their interest in the arts and their knowledge of the various techniques and artists. At the end of the month we plan to survey the students again to see what knowledge they gained from the program and whether they enjoyed it. After the project is complete the students are able to benefit from the teacher for homework assistance as well."

HHH and Measure H to fund homeless housing and services, LA has an opportunity. How do we build the political will for tangible policies that lift the homeless, and Los Angeles, out of this crisis?

She would make herself a snack, do her homework and get ready for bed before her parents returned home. Ivonne would complete her homework but much of the work would be incorrect. She became frustrated and even more isolated because she felt like she was disappointing her parents. During parent conferences, her teachers suggested that she join the after-school program provided at the school. This was her turning point. Ivonne discovered she had a true passion, music. Her mentor, Jose, would work with her academically and musically every afternoon. Ivonne participated in the We Are Ready program after-school. She began to research the different pathways that would give her a great education as well as continue to allow her to pursue her passion of music. She never really had anyone talk to her about high school or college. The W.A.R. program empowered her and because of it she was able to decide what high school she wanted to go to that would align with her future career. Ivonne sites her attendance at CampUs (ASAS-LA’s high school/college readiness summer camp) as the inspiration to become a student mentor in our W.A.R. program after she graduated. Ivonne went on to receive the Bill Gates Foundation Scholarship and attended Yale University for her undergraduate degree. She continues to return to CampUs as a Counselor and educate students in all the areas she was unaware of before entering the program.",

We heard stories and saw pictures of a tiny young woman who went out on the streets of Kabul with a ladder and a few paint cans, transforming the rubble and decay of war into dreamscapes with the silhouetted figure of a forlorn woman with no mouth. Shamsia would later tell me that her girl has no mouth because even if she is allowed to speak, she is not allowed to say what she really means on the streets of Afghanistan. She tells me of men stopping her in the street and beating her with hands and sticks, telling her that \"art is against Islam.\" But she continues her work unfettered, driven by an internal desire to create that will not be silenced by man, or religion, or act of Congress. This is the true spirit of an artist. This is the true nature of free speech; having the ability to speak your true despite threat of violence, even if everyone else is against you. It is for this reason, we created the Art in Protest program. To give a voice to people like Shamsia who have sacrificed everything for their art. We initially brought Shamsia to our program in Oslo where she did a live demonstration of her work in the public area, and even collaborated on a piece with a punk rock artist from Cuba whose still seemed aggressive compared to the demure and soft-spoken young woman.",

The program starts off by empowering youth ages 16-21 to draw out their vision for the program. The entrepreneur training program will be teaching the key elements of starting and operating a small business and steps on how to start a business in the LA area. Youth will complete a personalized business plan based on their personal creative interests. The youth will learn how to be a leader by taking part in engaging activities that focus on: multicultural communication, critical thinking skills, and emotional intelligence. The three part program builds upon entrepreneurship, leadership, and career development skills needed in LA’s new economy. In entrepreneurship, youth will learn the steps on how to start a business in the LA area and will complete a personalized business plan based on their personal creative interests. In leadership, youth will learn how to be a leader by taking part in engaging activities that focus on three components: communication, emotional intelligence and mental abilities. The social component focuses on learning advanced communication skills in group communication, cross-cultural communication, global communication, and professional networking. A diversity workshop is focused on creating empathy for the many cultures and rich diversity races, religions, socioeconomic status, language abilities, people with a criminal justice background, immigration status, age, sexual orientation, etc, which exist in Los Angeles. The second component is emotional awareness focusing on providing youth with critical thinking skills, and the appreciation of non-traditional forms of success including the arts, innovation, outside-the-box thinking, fostering of new ideas without the fear of failure, and focus on the flexibility of universal skills. In career, youth will focus on career development by learning how to personally brand themselves, social media etiquette, networking, create a resume, partaking in career assessments, mock interviews and learning how to turn internships into full time jobs to start their career. Our Youth Entrepreneurship Training will help promote social and cultural identity, build a stronger sense of community, and give youth, especially at-risk youth, a sense of meaning and belonging. Recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions will increase thanks to our program as we will partner with local higher education institutes to have representatives come and make presentations and engage our youth about their respective institutions and programs. Youth that participate in this program are innovative, creative, community oriented, and hardworking. This program will help youth unleash their potential by connecting youth to resources and programs will create long-term Angeleno entrepreneurs in our great city."

    "Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.": "\"Nobody Walks In L.A.\" is a myth - our region is a mecca of outdoor sports enthusiasts, from hikers to cyclists, to urban walkers. The more our residents get out of their cars and onto the streets, the more appreciation they have of the colorful tapestry of neighborhoods and people that make up the city. Social media has enabled large groups of like-minded individuals to explore our urban environments, walking hundreds of miles of the city. Walking leads to a belief in the value of public transit, quality public spaces, and clean streets. Frustrated by the amount of trash left on the streets and sidewalks, some of these people teamed up with friends to come out and do a series of impromptu trash pickups. On a Sunday in 2018, a small group of us cleaned about a mile and a half of Hollywood streets in about an hour and a half. Residents, business owners, and even passing motorists cheered the effort. Afterward, we asked \"how can we upscale this to cover a large portion of the city?\" Knowing there are thousands of L.A. residents who not only enjoy walking, but would likely pitch in to do a manageable walk that results in a mass citywide cleanup, it was clear that this was about creating a simple concept on a audacious scale. Using inspiration from the grassroots #UNLITTER or #TRASHTAG movement, and from the mass just-for-fun \"Great Walk of L.A.,\" we created the concept for a one-day organized trash pickup event, where nearly 650 miles of streets will be “unlittered” in just a few hours. Volunteers in teams will each walk one of 160+ 4-mile loop routes starting and ending at an LA Metro station. Using mobile technology and social media, UnlitterLA promises to be the biggest mass street cleanup ever attempted, and as a regular event, it can make a significant difference in the appearance of our city as well as the actions of our residents. Months later, walking down that same Hollywood street we cleaned several months ago, we can still see a noticeable difference and we're proud for even the small bit we've achieved.

Initially we wanted to offer homework help followed by a photography program but the tweens at this property had a hard time following a structured curriculum. Like most 12 year olds, they usually wanted to purchase the occasional snow cone and plow through our art supplies-doodling and painting quickly with no commitment to a long term art piece. So we were not sure the Rocketeer Club would be a huge success at this site. At first these same six kids-three boys and three girls-showed interest. Especially the boys when we started to teach robotics with LEGOs. Still as time progressed we noticed the boys were more prone to speed through a project and leave to go skateboard outside. The girls however stayed behind. The three of them eagerly sat through two-hour science days three times a week. They ultimately became friends and they held each other accountable. If someone didn't show up for class, then one would go knock on their door and remind them. They started to ask for even more chemistry experiments outside of the regular curriculum. The three girls formed a team, each taking on a different STEM persona- Genesis the doctor, Lotara the engineer, and Angel the biologist. In the end this trio were the only three to attend the field trip from their property. They stuck together on the bus, at lunch, and smoothly worked together in the Mission Control simulation at the Space Center. It would be endearing enough to say that this program created friends within an apartment community, but the true value of the Rocketeer Club was that it influenced the career possibilities for these girls. Together they empowered one another to role play what a life in a STEM profession would be. They imagined a world in which working with other females in a laboratory would be the norm.

In synthesizing this information, we discovered that parental involvement was paramount in success rates as well as insight into the growth of self-esteem among participants. Are focus in the following program will be to interview community members including property managers, parents, and participants both at the beginning, middle, and end of the program through phone calls in person interviews and town hall events that will serve as focus groups.",

After a successful two month pilot program inside the camp that we called Yes We Can: Pop-Up Schools we came back home to Los Angeles and quickly realized access to education was the biggest hurdle in the children’s lives there as it is here in our Los Angeles communities. That realization gave birth to the Schools On Wheels bilingual program and inspiration turned into action within a couple of weeks. Once the spark lit the fire we reached out to our community members and raised $17,000 which helped us acquire the first bus and begin the conversion process to turn it into a mobile classroom. The Schools On Wheels program is a program by the people for the people. We have shared the conversion process with our community over social media and the impact the mobile classroom has had within our community has been pouring out with multiple requests to visit schools in the LAUSD areas as well as new original programs looking for a way to reach children in need and that is how we have turned inspiration into impact.",

In many underserved neighborhoods there is a higher likelihood of residents finding multiple fast food chains than wholesome grocery stores, which requires residents to venture into other neighborhoods or settle for less healthy food options. That’s why United Parents & Students launched a food justice campaign. Members have reported a prevalence of rotting, expired food and poor customer service in many of their local grocery stores. “Having fresh food options within communities can have a huge impact on the overall quality of life,” said Mitchell. “Nutritious food can change how disease and poor health plague areas that are saturated with unhealthy food options.”",

Still, the potential addition of a citizenship question has caused fear and anxiety around Census 2020 during a time when overall trust in the federal government is eroding, namely among our immigrant communities. With more than 1.5 million immigrants living in the City of Los Angeles, comprising over 38% of our population, the story of Los Angeles is fundamentally tied to the stories of our immigrant residents. The Mayor’s Office has been deeply engaged in efforts to integrate immigrants into the City’s social, economic, and political fabric through the Office of Immigrant Affairs. To date, the Office has actively engaged more than 150,000 Angelenos through its work to coordinate city services, develop programs and initiatives that promote citizenship, civic engagement and advocate on local, state, and national legislation and policy. From the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs to the incredible programs provided by local community organizations, Los Angeles comes together to support our immigrant neighbors and the 2020 Census is no different. We need to ensure that our immigrant populations are included in the nation’s headcount, or the full story of Los Angeles will not be told in 2020.

After a few failed community outreach attempts, the groups of friends decided to create a unique giving experience.The group of friends went to their local grocery store and bought enough food to prepare 100 lunches. The friends connected with each other on a different level, while having the time of their lives! Through this jovial and meaningful effort, the friends connected with their communities on a different level as well. The group’s first distribution was near the Santa Monica Pier and Venice Boardwalk; the group connected with various individuals experiencing homelessness and hunger. The friends shared the meals they prepared and received insight into the experiences of their homeless neighbors. After the initial experience, the friends sought to share this experience with more of their friends — by repeating and expanding their efforts. Through social media platforms, the group tagged photos of their experiences with #HashtagLunchbag as an ode to hashtags and their efforts. Thus, the advocacy campaign and outreach project that is #HashtagLunchbag was initiated. They decided to repeat their #HashtagLunchbag efforts in January 2013. As the impact increased, the scope and goal of #HashtagLunchbag expanded. Eventually, #HashtagLunchbag set a goal of making 1,000 meals. 100 people arrived to support the effort, and 1,000 meals were successfully made and distributed.

But they were thwarted at every turn by hostile communities and haunted by public trust that had been damaged in a heavy-handed approach to growth. Projects were languishing for years in the development process, facing lawsuits and public backlash which threatened to put a stranglehold on our economy. Now, we’re not saying that we wear a cape and have an \"S\" on our chest (for \"sustainability\" of course), but our founders certainly recognized the importance of having an organization that could act as a bridge between the community and the ports, one that would promote a fact and data-driven policy-making process, and a group that could help both grow AND green port operations. FuturePorts was borne of the need to educate elected leaders and the public about the return on the investment in our ports and the supply chain they support, and 14 years later, we are still at it. Our work has resulted in billions of dollars' worth of construction being completed in and around the San Pedro Bay ports, resulting in thousands of good paying jobs, increased economic activity, cleaner air and water, and supporting 42% of the containerized cargo that enters our great nation. So yeah, maybe we do wear a cape.",

For example, there are many residents who use the City’s Public Library system for job searches, including resume creation.

There are also scenarios where Senior residents may need to complete banking transactions that have become completely automated, and the customer does not have experience with using a kiosk or a computer. And most importantly, as the City transitions to providing increased digital services, everyone should be equipped with the ability to use tools such as the MyLA311 app and the ShakeAlertLA app, as well as strive towards becoming civicly engaged in the City through the use of its open data portal.

The idea was born when seeing like-new crayons be discarded by restaurant staff at kid-friendly restaurants at a rate of 150 million crayons/year. Crayons do not decompose as they are made of paraffin wax. In addition, the norm of tossing still good crayons worsened the \"throw-away society\" Americans are known for and kids were watching this happen over and over again. We had to re-think trash as our landfills were overfilled and trash had to be transported miles away from Los Angeles via train. We started to pair local underserved Title 1 schools with participating restaurants who agreed to collect the still good crayons for us. Local schools would pick up over 2500 crayons per month for homework and a variety of art projects. Crayon Collection broke a cycle of waste that was longstanding and many people never considered and instilled a new mindset. Next, we challenged LA based artists to create projects ideas using just crayons so students could have robust art education curriculum, another program that was cut in public schools. The Crayon Collection model was an example of how we can do better but thinking of solutions. It was at these very same restaurants that we noticed full glasses of water with plastic straws in them that no one ordered. We realized that this was a \"habit of waste\" that needed to be changed as ewll. We spearheaded the ban on plastic straws and cutlery in the iconic City of Malibu, which ignited worldwide change against single-use plastics. We launched a new program called Habits of Waste to address more environmental issues including plastics and many other things. Then #LAGREENTEEN allows us to reduce dependency on plastic water bottles in LAUSD schools by providing another solution - filtered water units. Creating a new “eco-normal” consciousness that focuses on stewardship of the environment and support of nearby communities in need. Now, we are inspiring environmental action & career building for low-income students who have less access to environmental opportunities than their affluent counterparts.",

We have curated the workshops to address 1). the problem single-use plastic , 2.)why clean drinking water (64 ounces per person per day) is so necessary and so crucial for ALL people to have access to, 3.) how the students can become \"active agents\" in their home, school and community. 4.) Students will learn how to raise awareness and funds by reaching out through social media and local businesses. The students will learn that no matter where you live, your voice matters and that clean water is a basic right. A large portion uses social media as the tool to create social change. High school students \"speak\" social media so we know there are huge metrics we can discover through their work. Habits of Waste will ensure that the students are successful in installing the clean water filters but we want the students to also work with us to reach out to the community and receive funds. Our timeline is as follows: Week 1 Dr. Tim Pershing from Assemblymember Richard Bloom’s will teach the workshop called \"The Problem with Single-Use Plastics\" in addition to screening documentary film, \"STRAWS\". Week 2 Dr. Angelica Hernandez from UCLA will focus on successful grassroots movements, Week 3 will be led by experts in social media explaining powerful social media strategy, Week 4 will be the culmination project where students will learn how to reach out to their community to find support for an important cause like access to clean water. Habits of Waste will help them create a GoFundMe page as well so that the students can see how they are progressing. The population we are serving: students and faculty of Los Angeles Senior High which is located mid-city, on Olympic Blvd. It has 1,544 students with 92.74% classified as low-income, 78% Hispanic and 13% black, and ranks in the bottom 16% of the district with a Pupil/Teacher ratio of 20.58. Auditing student consumption levels of single-use plastics and making strides to cut those levels is an integral part of the program. We will provide surveys to all students at the beginning of the program and at the end. This project will provide students with access to free CLEAN water so they no longer need to use limited resources to purchase water. It will also divert them from purchasing sodas or sugary drinks as this option is free and delicious. ALL LAUSD schools should have these filtered drinking station as this will change the trajectory of those living in the inner city to have healthier lives and through the #LAGREENTEEN progam, students will also understand how to create change and use their voice.

We need to expand our program to fully turn the philosophy and protocols of this model into a codified, scalable, learning system. Educators, leaders, and board members of Larchmont Charter School believe that every child arrives with different cultural influences and deserves the right to progress with through systems of inclusion rather than systems that discriminate against minorities, those with learning differences, language barriers, or the effects of poverty. All students are met respectfully in our classrooms, with curriculum appropriate for their level, but the need for a strategic, articulated, codified system citing how educators assess each learner, at all grade levels and across four geographically and demographically different campuses and then how educators will offer each student the appropriate universal design for instruction are the core goals this grant will allow us to achieve. We seek to provide this tool not only to our own faculty but also to other educators of diverse groups of students who seek the success this model allows for their own learning communities.",
    "In what stage of innovation is this project?​": "Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects)",
    "Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.": "In 2005, Larchmont Charter School was founded by a group of parents who refused to stand by and allow their public schools to falter. They drew upon the professional and cultural resources of their diverse Los Angeles neighborhoods (primarily Hollywood, West Hollywood, Larchmont, and Koreatown) to build a community of engaged and committed families. Now in its 14th year, and successfully scaled up to serve students K-12, the school has responded to the academic needs of its community to become one of the leading public schools in the city (and state.) Further, Larchmont recognizes the importance of academics, social/emotional learning, and behavioral factors for all grades. The school’s constructivist philosophy dictates that every child has a right to build upon his/her/their strengths, and each classroom is a collective of individual learners, not a group that can be instructed to median standards. This requires intensive attention from our educators. In the younger grades, we developed tools to assist teachers in this effort, such as the Whole-Child Check In, where faculty can track student performance in academics and social-emotional learning based on factors beyond test scores--factors that may include learning differences related to cultural differences. This Whole-Child Check In has scaled to our 6th grade, but more work is needed to adapt it developmentally and culturally to the secondary campus.",
    "Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​": "Techniques for measuring success will be built into the project. A survey system (before and after participation in our workshops, for instance) will help us track comprehension of The Larchmont Model and its benefits. We also survey stakeholders for their advice and assessments of the curriculum before it is executed."

Back then and still today, SLA residents experience disproportionately high rates of diet-related illnesses like diabetes, compared to other parts of SLA and this is due primarily to a lack of access to, and daily consumption of healthy, nutrient rich foods. These students saw the infrastructure surrounding this notorious low-income community and commonly described food desert - underfunded school lunch programs, copious liquor and fast food stores, poverty, and peoples’ hectic lives all still create complex barriers to healthy eating that people in other parts of LA don’t face. They asked, “How can we change the way our community eats?” RDLA formed to support these and other SLA youth to increase their own capacity to develop local solutions to address food insecurity in SLA.",

Unfazed by these obstacles, she started her own system. Lara began a container garden at a local preschool and and planted food in her sidewalk parkway. Soon she was filling containers with edibles anywhere she could get permission. In one garden, Lara heard a little girl squeal with delight. She had just tasted something but didn't know what it was. Lara explained that it was a yellow cherry tomato. The girl didn't know tomatoes could be that size or color. Lara knew her hobby had become impactful and important work. She realized growing food and working with nature is empowering for everyone, and that the entire community longs for more opportunities to do so. She dedicated herself to gardening for the community while educating herself. She became a Certified Master Gardener in 2012, and founded Green Girl Farms in 2014.",

In our community engagement phase, we will identify and collate the needs of the community in order to inform our project physical plan and design. As the project moves forward, we will measure participation in the community by engagement in events and build days. Further on in the process, an activated volunteer team will be responsible for the project’s continued success and measurements. This will include measuring number of visitors and volunteers, tracking fruit harvest in weight and distribution, and tracking outreach strategies including website visits, newsletter opens, and social media engagement data. As well, the public orchard will continue to grow its collaborative partnerships to include other like-minded organizations and continue fundraising efforts to ensure long-term sustainability. There are currently no trees at our chosen location, and we estimate to add about twenty to the tree canopy of our neighborhood. By normalizing fruit picking we hope to increase our resident’s self sufficiency rating substantially while measurably increasing access to healthy food."
