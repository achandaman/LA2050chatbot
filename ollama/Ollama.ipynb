CONNECT | LEARN Submitted Expansion of Existing Work Greater Los Angeles is home to 59,000 men, women and children experiencing homelessness — 75% living without adequate shelter. Our volunteers offer hope and sustenance by providing survival kits to our homeless neighbors with essential aid to survive. The kits provide vital aid and allow the opportunity for homeless to seek help as well as an empathetic connection, relieving the loneliness of being ignored. #11 states that ~9,000 people would be directly impacted by our work. ~3,000 volunteers will serve ~6,000 homeless. ~9000 people will be indirectly impacted assuming that each of the 3,000 volunteers will share how their experience has impacted their view on homelessness with 2-4 friends. We wanted to show the full impact of our program and how this proposal will enlarge the impact of the ~3000 volunteers who share their experiences serving ~6,000 homeless. This shared dialogue will further bridge our empathy gap between housed and homeless neighbors, as well as drive a much-needed discussion raising awareness of housing policies and existing/failed solutions. This will grow support for more human-centered and inclusive policies. Success will be measured by: Our outreach and educational programs are foundational to our mission to provide essential aid and a connection to the homeless and to educate volunteers and the public about the realities and myths of homelessness.

      "Reunify, Reconnect, Reach, LA Homeless 2024/reunify-reconnect-reach-la-homeless 2024 U Cast News and U Cast Studios This grant will go towards three separate projects/programs that have the same targeted audience – the homeless. The first project is to help reunify homeless people with their families/friends (if they so choose) through the creation of a homeless directory that would be available for the public to use, secondly, raise awareness about the daily struggles the homeless face in LA, and lastly, to promote homeless organizations with free ads.   LIVE Submitted New or Pilot Projects Primarily for the directory, it is extremely difficult for people to find their loved ones who are homeless. Someone can contact homeless organizations and a note can be put on their file, but that's the best that exists right now and it doesn't guarantee that that note will actually make it to their loved ones. Largely speaking, if you're homeless, it is very hard for your family to contact you.  With the homeless directory, it has the potential to give thousands of family members of homeless people the ability to find them. As it stands now, it is extremely difficult for the families of the homeless to find their loved ones. Many people who are homeless don't want to be found, but for those who want some form of reunification with their family members, this directory could be the first step in helping them turn their lives around.   With the three-part video series, the goal would be to inform the public of just how hard and difficult the lives of the homeless are. The desired impact would be that for the people who see it, they will view the homeless issue through a different lens.   With the free ad giveaway, the intended consequence will be to support pre-established organizations that are already doing great work helping the homeless. For the directory, it will be the creation of it and getting web traffic to it. The goal will be to get the directory up and functional within two months of the grant being awarded (but no longer than four months after the grant is awarded). For the video series, the goal will be to get people to watch it. This series will be promoted in my media outlet (in both physical and digital media). Additionally, I will promote this series through non-profits and through media appearances. For the free ad giveaway, each recipient of the ad giveaway will be told how much the ads they're being given are worth.    This project has three parts:    1. The creation of a homeless directory (called The Homeless Directory.com). This directory will have a dedicated URL and it will be free and available for any member of the public to use. How it will work is that homeless shelters and organizations, while they're working with their clients, will ask them if they want to opt-in to being in this directory. If they say yes, however much information they want listed about themselves will be entered in by their caseworker. Each person whose information is put in the directory reserves the right to have their personal listing removed at any time, for any reason (if they so choose).  2. The creation and production of a three-part video series that will feature the stories of three different homeless people. The purpose of this series will be to show how difficult their lives are, and the daily struggles they face. This series will be available to watch for free online.   3. To give away $30,000 worth of free ads to homeless organizations and shelters in Los Angeles in my media outlet, U Cast News and U Cast Studios. These ads will be given out to at least four different organizations. These ads will appear in both physical and digital media.

      "Supporting Self-Advocacy to Break the Homelessness Cycle 2024/supporting-selfadvocacy-to-break-the-homelessness-cycle 2024 People Organized for Westside Renewal (POWER) When people facing homelessness are receiving case management and interim housing, they’re often left to navigate the system on their own. In the majority of cases, they never make it to being permanently housed. With our toolkit, people facing homelessness will have the tools they need to advocate for themselves through this convoluted system and have agency in the service pipeline to attain permanent housing. LIVE Submitted New or Pilot Projects One of POWER’s members was a Project Roomkey participant who was moved into interim housing while she waited for her housing voucher. Over the two years she waited, she was awarded a voucher, but was never told. Her voucher subsequently expired. Without assistance from our employee, who took the issue to the Mayor’s office, it’s without a doubt our member would have ended up living on the street again. There are thousands of stories like this one, which unfortunately end with people becoming homeless again. This cycle occurs because navigating the myriad of LA’s housing services is an overwhelming task, and one unhoused people frequently undertake alone. While programs like Inside Safe boast temporarily housing thousands of people, those numbers dwindle when it comes to permanently housing people. If we do not plug the substantial gap in the service provision industry with specialized tenant navigation support, we will continue to lose our battle to end homelessness through attrition. This project will plug gaps in the homelessness services pipeline by keeping people in housing once they are housed. The Inside Safe program has brought over 2,000 individuals inside, but has secured permanent housing for around 400 (although those numbers have recently been disputed). It is clear that despite money and energy being devoted to solving homelessness, there is a missing piece in the process that results in people cycling in and out of interim housing. With our toolkit, we will address how to navigate City and County housing services, so the information will be applicable to the entire County unhoused population of over 70,000 individuals. Empowering unhoused folks with the information needed to be their own advocates will result in them being able to independently navigate these systems with more success, retaining their housing. Our project will help folks stay off the streets, which will maximize the impact of our investments into homelessness programming and services. Due to its digital nature, we will be able to track the metrics of the toolkit site, including site visitors, time spent on the site, and clicks to the site. We will also keep a record of the number of people we interact with at doors and the number of workshop participants, as in-person contact will be vital to the project. Out of the people we interact with personally, we will track who was able to gain or regain housing. Near the end of the grant period, we will survey participants to see how the toolkit was helpful and what is missing so we can continue to improve the resources available for folks navigating these systems, making sure it is as accessible and effective as possible. POWER will create an online and printed toolkit that explains how to be a self-advocate while navigating the complexity of LA’s housing system. The toolkit will include resources on vouchers and recertification, subsidies and how they work, and how to get questions answered when case managers can’t answer. Vitally, this toolkit will provide information that is not readily available to those navigating the housing system, and prepare users to advocate for their rights and know what to do when conflicts arise. There is a severe shortage of case managers who are well-trained and not deeply over capacity, so putting the power in the hands of tenants will ensure that they have the ability to pursue more successful outcomes in their participation in government and non-profit housing programs. Our project has three components: 1. Compiling resources and building the toolkit, with special attention to accessibility. 2. An outreach and education campaign about the availability of this tool and how to use it. This will be conducted through door-to-door canvassing, social media, and community and governmental partnerships. 3. The final component of this project will entail gathering feedback from users and workshop participants to discover any gaps in the toolkit, which will then be addressed. Ultimately, this toolkit and outreach campaign will increase the number of people who stay housed after moving in from the streets.
